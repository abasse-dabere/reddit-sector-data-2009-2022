investing,How much riskier than money market funds do you think ultra short bond ETFs are?,"I am talking about MINT, FLRN, FLOT, NEAR, GSY for example.

&amp;#x200B;

I am considering placing 6-month emergency fund money in one of these ETFs for convenience since my brokerage has zero commission.

I know the duration is short so interest rate risk is low.

Do you think capital preservation risk in a recession is significant with these ETFs?",finance

personalfinance,Loan Repayment Plan,"Hi all,

I'm about to graduate from college with $22k of debt at 5% interest, all of which are my federal loans. I also have about $22k in cash right now and could pay the loan in full the day I walk across the stage.

But that isn't the flow-chart optimal strategy. It says that I should build a 3-6 month emergency fund before paying down moderate interest debt. I have a good job lined up, so even if I do that my cash flow will allow me to make payments with no issue, but my job security makes me feel as if an emergency fund doesn't need to be such an immediate concern.

I could also probably invest my money and earn in excess of 5% returns, but that comes with some risk, whereas just paying the debt is essentially equivalent to a 100% guarantee of making 5% on my money.

What should I do? Thanks!",finance
personalfinance,Interest rates on student loans up 1-2% over the last year. Advice?,"Hey all,

I now realize that refinancing some of my student loans with a low variable interest rate 4 years ago was a bad idea even though the low rate was super appealing. I refinanced at around 4.5% with Citizens Bank and the interest rate has been going nothing but up for the past year. It is now at 7.3%. My federal loans have also gone up around 2% over the last year to 5.97%. Between the two my payment is $955.35 per month. I can make those payments but it's really holding me back in life. My current financial situation:

Income pre tax is around $3500 per month. My monthly bills and obligations including the student loan and another $14,000 @ 13% personal loan is around $2083.00 per month. The personal loan went towards buying a duplex which is actually paying for itself and me living in the other half. That figure does not include food and going out. I limit myself to going out with friends to 4 times per month and nothing extravagant. I am currently putting all extra money towards that personal loan first and then will be towards. My credit score is respectable at 731 so maybe I can refinance the student loans?

I have things I want to do and at 29 I feel like I am wasting my life away working a career job and driving Uber on the side. I want to buy a house(something permanent), I want to date(my financial situation is keeping me from even trying to date) and I want to travel at least a little bit. I am not sure what else I can/should do and any advice would be greatly appreciated.",finance

personalfinance,Best credit card for somebody with a 0% credit score (no credit history)?,"Hi all, I'm 19 and I have zero credit. I'm in college and I'm trying to build up a foundation for myself but I'm having a hard time. Long story short my income just isn't cutting it. I had two jobs but I had to quit one so I had enough time to study and pass, this hurt my little income severely and I've exhausted everything I have making car payments and paying back small payday loans I get to help me get by. I can't take out another student loan until summer semester starts and if you can't tell by now im tired of being broke by Tuesday (like today) after paying my bills with no access to money for basic shit lile food and gas (I'm hungry).
It's time I build my credit anyways so I wanted some advice on the best credit card I can get for my age and credit status. I'm not gonna do anything stupid with it, just use it to buy food and gas IF I run out money in the middle of the week and need something to get by.

personalfinance,Should i get another loan to pay off my car (US),"Well, here's my situation: about a year ago i bought a car, mostly for work, with really high interest rate. At that time it seemed to me like a good deal because i had to pay for my work vehicle weekly about the same price anyway and this way i could build my credit history (i live in the states just since 2016). Also at a dealership i was told that i could refinance after 8 payments and get a better rate. Unfortunately, im unable to do that. Some time ago i found out not a single bank would refinance my loan if i dont have a green card (i have work visa). Right now i own about 20k still, with monthly payments of 540$, where 300 average goes for interest rate.   
So, my questin is: is it a good idea to get 20k loan with better rates, pay off a car, and keep paying those 20 but to another bank with lower interest?",finance
personalfinance,Home loan through Ally or local?,"Hi /pf,

My wife has just accepted a university teaching position, and we're working on moving to a new state and buying our first home.  I've banked with Ally for several years (partly at the recommendation of this sub) and had only good experiences, so I started the home loan pre-approval process through them, especially keeping in mind their rate matching policy.  They preapproved us for an amount putting many of the homes we like within our budget, with a 4.375% rate (4.7646% APR) for a 30 year ""HomeReady"" fixed, which is a first time home owner program that they have here in Alabama.

&amp;#x200B;

At our realtor's recommendation we also contacted a local housing lender (Trustmark) who recommended that we put the loan only in my wife's name since she will have the primary income for this year, and doesn't have any debt while I have student loan debt in my name.  By doing so he got us preapproved for almost 50k higher than ally with a 4.125% rate on a 30 year fixed, also stating that he would do whatever it took to match anything Ally offered.

&amp;#x200B;

He also said that we qualify for a 30 year fixed rate with no down required (but we can put some down if we wish), that would have  a 4.375% interest rate but no mortgage insurance.  

&amp;#x200B;

Overall we really liked talking to the local person, as well as the better rates that he offered.  Since both are at least theoretically willing to match the other's rate, are there any other factors to consider for local vs. national?

personalfinance,Looking for (expensive) vehicle advise (CAN).,"Partly posting this just because it helps to type it out, but advice is welcome.

I'm 34m, single, no kids.  I’m looking into a newer vehicle but there’s some pretty serious sticker shock happening.  Newer pickups are crazy expensive, you can spend 90k CAD on one and “normal” (based on ad quantity) seems to be 60k!  My 2011 could last another 1-2 years before I expect that it will be full-on beater.  It has rust spots (small for now), a funny clunk in the transmission or rear-end, and lots of other minor-ish maintenance needed and is pushing 200,000km.  It’s probably still worth 10k private sale despite this.  Trucks are ridiculous…

I’ve always laughed at people with $600+ payments for 6-8 years but now I’m staring down the barrel of being one of them.  I bought mine in 2013 at 2 years old, 60,000km for $22,500 over 4 years at 3% so~$500/mo.  I just paid off some debt with the vehicle I sold before that.  A similar vehicle now is worth over 30k, I think largely due to the Canadian dollar or maybe just the availability of big 96-month financing plans.

My Options:
1. Mile out my current pickup for 1-2 more years.  Ignoring the issue with driving a beat-up-ish truck for the time being, a major maintenance item and depreciation due to rust could create a cost-of-ownership similar to a newer vehicle.  I don’t really have time to be working on it myself anymore and I travel around a lot to places I don't want to get stranded.  At the end of the next year or 2 I still have to pick one of the following anyway, although I recognize this is the cheapest if nothing major happens.

2. Brand new 48k truck at 1%.  This is basically 1 or 2 models above base, but way below the Lariats, Laramies, Denalis etc.  Sell my old truck and invest the $ and just live with the $600/mo payments until I’m 41 (gross).  No maintenance for several years and I can get a new 3.0 diesel that gets much better mileage (not gross).

3. Brand new 41k truck at 0%, same as above but big V8 and lighter than I would like on options.  Same payment but for 6 vs 7 years so saving ~1200/year but probably spending half of that back in fuel.

4. Used 30-35k truck at ~5%.  This would normally be my choice but the interest rates really hurt this one, and it will already have 2-3 years of driving on it.

5. I considered combining option 1 and 4 with a smaller ~10k car to delay the death of the truck.  This seemed obvious at first but depreciation, maintenance, and especially insurance on 2 vehicles makes it a lot more expensive than it sounds, and fuel savings is only about the same as option 2.

I feel pretty defeated here but option 2 (or maybe 3) seems to make the most sense.  Especially with the added benefit of having a new vehicle, which is worth something in a quality-of-life sense although I realize it wears off in a year or 2.  I can afford the payments assuming my job remains stable, and even if it doesn't I've been head-hunted twice in the past year and have a good network.  Open to suggestions.

personalfinance,Decided To Sell Home To Obtain Financial Freedom,"After months of discussion, my wife and I decided we are going to sell our home in order to hopefully get out of debt in a year. 

Currently we have about $75K in credit card debt and 48k in personal loans. We have an estimated 100k+ equity in the house right now. We’re hoping that after seller fees we can end up with 80k+ remaining from the sale. 

This should hopefully put us around 40k in remaining debt. The plan being to pay off all debts with the highest interest rates. We then plan to rent for the next couple of years. 

Based on our income and budget outside of debt payments, I estimate we can hopefully reach debt freedom in 10-12 months. Right now we make just shy of 200k a year. Unfortunately it’s gotten to the point that paying anything down is next to impossible. I feel this is the only way we can get to where we’d like to be financially. 

If anyone has similar stories, I’d love to hear any advice. Hopefully we can make it all go to plan. Obviously the more we can make off the sale of our home the better.",finance

personalfinance,How should I go about reducing the minimum payment on my CC?,"I know the short answer is - pay it off. Let me provide more detail.   


I have two credit cards in my name, one through Chase and one through Citi. My current financial mess is as follows:

  
Chase: I owe $5700, minimum payment is $137 and interest rate is 18.24 (I have $1900 of credit remaining) 

Citibank: I owe $1100, minimum payment is $26 and interest rate is 20.49 (I have $399 of credit remaining)   


I am thinking on how I should tackle these debts. My original plan is to try to pay off the Citibank card as aggressively as possible. I want to prioritize staying the hell away from maxing out. Because the minimum payment on the Citi card is actually manageable (I know I should be paying more but the Chase payments are already a handful) I was wondering if I should then use the Citi card to pay off some of the balance on the Chase card in hopes to reduce the monthly minimum payment.   


I figured this isn't ideal, but I am worried about applying for a third card. I don't know if I would get approved for a balance transfer card, but would that be helpful? I don't live in the states right now, so I can't sit down with someone about this. I don't even know what gameplan makes the most sense, since I've been stressing about this for a few days now. I want that $137 to drop as soon as possible. Once interest gets tacked back onto that Chase card, its like I've paid nothing. Any and all advice would be helpful. I do not plan to use these cards any further. I pay my rent and most other daily needs in cash.   


About employment and why this has been difficult, - I do work, but it's hourly work and there are some really tight months when work isn't busy. The $25 on citi is okay - if it were just that charge, I would be paying well above that to clear my debt, but that dang Chase card... I am seeking additional employment at the moment, but I am in the waiting game until I hear back. I am also on Upwork although it's difficult to get jobs there. I'd be happy to do any remote writing/proofreading/transcribing work if there's any site like Upwork with jobs like that. Will continue to look around.",finance
personalfinance,I'm starting a new minimum wage job tomorrow. Would it be okay/wise for me to withhold the lowest option- 0.8%?,"(TLDR at bottom)

So, as my title says, I'm starting a new job at a gas station tomorrow. In Arizona the minimum wage is currently $11. I'm filling out my W-2 and A-4 paperwork right now. The lowest withholding is 0.8%. Then it bumps up to 1.3%, 1.8%, 2.7%, 3.6%, 4.2% or 5.1%. 

I guess I'm a little confused on this all. I see somewhere online that $10k-$25k income has a taxable income rate in AZ of 2.88%, but that's married but filing separately. I'm single (well have a live-in girlfriend, but shes the bread winner currently). Is this rate the same thing as the withholding rate on my A-4 packet? Is this for state or federal? State tax automatically gets taken out every paycheck, right?

Doing some rough calculations, if i get 30 hours per week, I'll make just under $15,000 in 12 months with $11/hr pay. $296 a week according to an online finance calculator for my state ($14,208).

I read that in [Arizona the $15,000 annual wages threshold has been removed.](https://www.nfc.usda.gov/Publications/HR_Payroll/Taxes/Bulletins/2011/TAXES-11-23att.html)

I apologize to be so unknowledgeable in this field, but what exactly does that mean and how does it apply to me if I dont end up making $15,000+? I read that if you dont, and filed for 1.8%, it would be automatically lowered to 1.3%. 

Will I owe money at the end of the year if I file the 0.8% withholding? To be completely honest, I'm not even sure *how* long this job will last. Cant exactly guarantee I'll even be there for a full year, though it *is* possible. I guess I'm just not a big fan of giving extra money away a free loan if it's not necessary. Would 0.8% screw me? Would 1.3% be on the safe side? Because from what I'm reading, it seems like I may need to do 2%+ but I'm not exactly sure if thats true... pretty sure I almost always chose 0.8% as a tern working many jobs and even though I always forgot to file taxes, I never seemed to owe any. I think I did 1.3 or 1.8 one year but never filed like a dumbass, so if I was owed anything back, I never got it. Which is why I dont wanna go overboard here and play it safe. Thank you! (Also, from my reading I should mark 1 on my W-4 since im unmarried aka ""single?"")

personalfinance,Emergency Fund Cautionary Tale (ACH Sucks),"It's great advice to keep an amount of liquid cash available for those just-in-case times when you need it. However, remember that it might not be quite as agile as you need.

The problem is that the backbone of banking is ACH (Automated Clearing House), the main system for transferring funds between one financial institution and the other. This process is slow and generally takes days. Wire transfers are faster but cost money.

If you are storing your emergency fund at a separate bank for interest rate reasons (like Ally, etc) know that getting that money into your normal checking account can take up to 3 business days, which means Wednesday if you have an emergency the previous Friday night.

Just something to keep in mind.",finance
personalfinance,Banking options for someone that frequently moves between countries,"Hey guys, I'm an American citizen, and I've been working in the UK for about two years now. I recently accepted a job in Dubai, and intend to continue switching jobs between countries for the next decade or so before coming back to the US. I'm trying to figure out if there's any reason not to keep my finances based in the US as opposed to moving them from country to country each time I move. 

Here in the UK I have a banking account, but I almost exclusively transfer the majority of my paychecks back to the US. I also only ever use my US based credit and debit cards for daily transactions as I get free foreign currency transactions and better cashback and interest rates than I could here in the UK. 

My question is, is there any reason to not do this? I feel like there's a better method than this, and that I could be running risk by keeping my assets in the US without actually living there, but at the same time overseas banking seems more expensive and not as convenient as it is in the US, and moving countries constantly seems like it makes putting money in any one country doesn't make sense. 

Am I running any risk by doing this, and are there any better options I should be looking at? Thanks in advance!",finance
personalfinance,Should I get a personal loan to consolidate my credit card debt?,"Hello,

&amp;#x200B;

So I currently have racked up quite a bit of credit card debt through some irresponsible spending.

&amp;#x200B;

Currently I have about 5 credit cards with a total credit line of $8000. My debt is currently around $7200. I know it's bad, I am shitting myself already.

&amp;#x200B;

So here is the reasons why I think I should get a personal loan followed by reasons I shouldn't.

\- My credit score went from 730+ to 630. If I clear my credit card debt into a personal loan, my credit score would start to increase a lot again as long as I keep my balances down and pay off the loan each month, right?

\- Won't have to worry about paying off 5 different cards at a time, just one loan.

\- Interest rates on credit cards will just get worse, and start a never ending cycle of just paying off interest. Loan would save me money.

\- 

&amp;#x200B;

Why I shouldn't

\- I currently do not have a steady guaranteed income. I am fairly sure I could manage monthly payments for a loan on top of rent, and phone, however it isn't 100% as of right now. I get income through a lot of different sources that aren't all guaranteed.

\- Personal loan will just be another place I owe money and if I don't be responsible could end badly.

\- Honestly cannot think of anymore reasons why I shouldn't.

&amp;#x200B;

I would really appreciate some advice on what would be the best direction to go and if people could throw in some more reasons of why I should or shouldn't do this. I personally feel the loan would be the best idea and I can pay that off every month and then when I have a more secure income and make a little more I can just start throwing a lot more money at it and get rid of it completely.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for your advice! Greatly appreciated",finance
personalfinance,Private student loan to study abroad,"Hi everyone,

I’ve been planning on studying abroad for a very long time. I’m faced with two programs: one I can afford and one I can’t really afford. They’re both in the same place but the affordable one isn’t really what I want in terms of structure and the unaffordable one is structurally the best (the one I want more). I’ve already calculated all possible resources (including federal loans), and I’d likely need an extra 3-5k for the unaffordable one. Should I take out a private student loan for that amount or is that really dumb? I know I should probably just go on the affordable one that I want less, but I don’t want to regret that choice (choosing something I don’t really want). Any advice?",finance
personalfinance,"Student Loan Debt, Refinancing, and What to Do","Hi there!

I see over and over again how helpful this subreddit is when it comes to debt and I wanted to reach out and see what advice you guys have.

I currently have around $40,000 in student loans through Sallie Mae and about $24,000 in Federal Student Loans.

My Sallie Mae loans have a rate of around 11 to 12 percent. It varies from each one. My mom says that my Sallie Mae loan rate is based on my dads credit score which is why my rate is so high. Idk his score but I know it's bad.  My FAFSA loans have a rate of around 4 to 5 percent. Outside of that, I don't have any more debt. My Sallie Mae loans were from when I went to a private university that was very expensive. I got full tuition but still had to borrow quite a bit. I'm no longer at that school and am now studying online, relying solely on my own money and FAFSA loans/grants, meaning no more Sallie Mae. I was told that since I'm still in school, and as long as I'm in school, I won't have to pay back my loans until 6 months after graduating. 

I currently make about $40,000 a year, I'm 23, married, no car payment, no credit card debt either. I use my credit card frequently but only within my own means and to pay it off every month. I have a credit score of about 700 right now. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, my question is: what should I do in regards to all of this? Should I refinance loans? Should I invest right now? When should I start paying those loans off? What advice can you offer me?

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks!

personalfinance,Why are my wife and I way under-taxed on federal income tax?,"My wife and I owed HUGE taxes this tax season for 2018 because we were under-taxed on our paychecks.  This was the 3rd year for each of us to be full-time employed and our first time experiencing that we owed taxes.  After reading this sub, we both re-filled out our federal tax witholdings in February to ensure we each had 0 allowances.  We revisit our paychecks today and see we are still way under-taxed and refilling those docs did basically nothing.  We are on pace for another huge tax bill at the end of the year.  Our federal income tax is about 2/3 what it should be for both of our paychecks.  We calculated out exactly how much needs to be withheld on our paychecks at the end of the year.

Why is it expected of us to do this math?  Why can't we just have the proper amount withheld, especially when we put 0 allowances?  It feels like the government is trying to trick us.

personalfinance,Should I take summer classes?,"Hi-

So I was planning to take 2 of my hardest upper level courses this semester. An Accounting 300 (4 Credits) and 400 (3 Credits) course. I ended up dropping the Accounting course earlier this year because I wasn't doing great and planned to take it in the summer. I figured it wouldn't be that much to take a class or 2 in the summer. However, the cost is extremely high.

&amp;#x200B;

Summer Tuition for 7 credits: $4,298

&amp;#x200B;

In comparison, after taking federal student loans during the regular semester where I'm taking 15 or more credits the cost is about $4,500. So It feels like I'm paying the same price, but for less courses.

&amp;#x200B;

I usually use the summer to work and then I use that money to pay off the $4,500 in fall, but right now I can't afford the summer. I would need 4,300 for the summer, 4500 for fall, and 4500 for spring. I can try to apply for a private student loan, but I think I'll get declined. I graduate in Spring 2020 and if I do well at my internship this summer then I will a full time job offer waiting for me post graduation. I have about $2500 saved. These classes will make my senior year, a living hell.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; I have $2500 saved and my options are:

Apply for a private student loan for: $4,298 (7 Credits) or;

Apply for a private student loan for: $2460 (4 credits) and take the other course during the year and hope for the best or;

Take both courses during the year and struggle and hope that I pass so I can graduate on time.

I did not have any unsubsidized loans. All of my loans were subsidized.

Furthermore, when I checked my Nelnet account online, it showed no interest being accumulated.

Now, I paid my monthly payment just like I always did each month. The only thing the deferment status did for me is that I didn't have to pay by the beginning deadline of each month.

Nothing instantly life changing, but enough to warrant really taking my time and making sure that I'm putting whatever it is I get into the best vehicles to really make a difference.  I've read a few similar posts on here that have helped me with a general strategy, but I'd appreciate some more specific advice, if possible.

The deceased has left an IRA ($400k),  an Immediate Annuity ($400k), and funds in a bank account  (\~$30k).  There are several beneficiaries, I will be receiving about 40%.  All holdings in Florida, I live in a different state.

My situation:  

* House note of $185k at a good interest rate, no desire to refinance  
* Two kids, aged 16 and 13, only $20K in college savings in a 529 for the eldest
* I am currently in B-School, and have paid roughly $8k towards what will be $40k in tuition
* $13k in Credit Card debt, pay $2k per month
* I (46M) have about $120k in my Roth 401k; Wife (54F) has $225K in a 403b, both contributing the max for employer match

So, I know the basics about leaving whatever I can in a Stretch IRA / Annuity.   The IRA is a managed IRA,  which I believe I can stretch, though I would most likely have to leave it in a managed account, or some of it would have to be liquidated and disbursed.  Is leaving it in the managed IRA the best move?

As for the Annuity,  it is an Immediate Annuity, and from what I'm told by the Company, must be paid out.  How best to deal with this?

Also:  taxes.  I've more opinions on what's going to be taxed / not-taxed, and its frankly a little worrying.  Some say that because there are beneficiaries named, both on the IRA and the Annuity, they are not subject to taxes, and not subject to the waiting period on the estate.

personalfinance,Where to start tackling my debt?,"Sorry for formatting (on mobile). 


I won't get into why I have this debt, but it was necessary until I could get on my feet and find a better job in my field after moving to a competitive HCOL area.


I finally found that better job, and I'm ready to start tackling my credit card debt, but I don't know where to start. I also think it's worth noting I've been paying slightly above minimum payments on my regular cards, and minimum on my transfer balance cards (4&amp;5). I'm familiar with the avalanche and waterfall methods, but I need help figuring out how to use both to minimize my interest charges. Here are the cards I'm dealing with:


Card 1  $5,250   25.24%

Card 2  $6,750   22.24%

Card 3  $6,600   21.24%

Card 4  $6,900   0% until 11/21/19, then 26.24%

Card 5  $3,900   0% until 4/23/20, then 21.74%

Card 6  $0          0% for 20 months. 


I applied to card 6 yesterday, and am hoping for $7,000 transfer limit if it's approved.


So here's where I need help. I can pay off around 2k/month. I obviously want to pay off Card 1 first. I want to transfer Card 2 to Card 6 if I'm approved (but I don't know if this is the wisest). I don't want to get another transfer balance card right now because my credit is lower than I want. It's still good, but I don't want another hit.


I need to worry about either paying off card 4 or transferring the balance to another card when the time comes (I would consider opening another card to transfer the balance at this time).


Should I look at getting a loan for cards 1&amp;3 right now with a lower interest rate? Should I transfer Card 1's balance instead of Card 2?


Also worth noting that I have to keep my score where it is or higher because I will most likely be moving to a new apartment July 2020. I don't mind carrying debt past that date, but I want it on one of the 0% interest balance transfer cards that I can take my time paying.

personalfinance,HELOC to Consolidate Debt? Advice needed!,"I have lurked on this sub for a bit, making changes to my life and budget, but I feel like things are just so badly out of control that this might be my only option!

I am roughly 30k in CC debt. (I was stupid with some in college, but I had to get a lawyer twice, which accounts for at least half of the debt.) Here is the low-down of my finances:

Income: $3500/month

Rent: $1800/month

CC payments: $700-800/month

Daycare: $725/month

Those are my major bills. My husband takes care of groceries/utilities/cable etc. He has his own debt (not near as bad as mine) and does not have extra $$ to throw towards my payments. At this point, I am only able to make the minimum payment on all of these each month, and because I have no money left over, I find myself needing to use bits of credit for essentials at the end of each month (formula, diapers, etc.).

We cannot downsize our apartment (2br with 2 kids) and cannot take in a roommate. I have applied for a food delivery service to make extra income, but I know it won't be near enough as I don't have time to commit more than 5-10 hours each week. Husband cannot get a second job because he is in school as well as working full time and I need help with the kids. We have been declined for personal loans because I need too much and my credit is in the trash. I feel like I have explored every option to pay off my debt or consolidate, but I will accept all tips/advice on my options.

All that to say, my mother is a SAINT and has offered to take out a home equity line of credit to help me consolidate my debt into a lower monthly payment at a lower interest rate. (All of my cards are between 20-29% APR, this loan would be between 2-5%.) Her home is completely paid off, and she does not have much debt herself. I know that this debt is not her responsibility at all, and I know she should not have to be on the hook for my debt. I would not even consider this if I felt like it wasn't my only option. I have always been 100% on time with my payments and will continute to do so if we do this.

Here are my questions: Can this hurt my mom in the long run? What are the cons for her (aside from if I don't make a payment)? Is this a terrible idea? Are there other options I haven't considered?

Living in California is super expensive and again supporting not just myself but my mom is very rough. However, ive been doing this for a long time and its comes to the point that i have officially paid off all of my debt from poorly made financial decisions (Death in the family causing me to overspent on credit cards to help an even bigger family, me spending on a girlfriend, etc); roughly 5k that i paid off in credit cards, that isn't much for alot of people on this forums but for me it was, especially with interest rates as high as 22%.

Now i am debt free, i have 3 credit cards, one with 1k, one with 5k and another with 3,500. I use them sparely and keep the amounts low (i.e 200 dollars or less, mainly i use just 1 with the cash back just so i can get something back and the second one on smaller purchases like if i want a candy bar or something; once it hits like 50 dollars i pay it back before the end of the pay period). 

&amp;#x200B;

So now, ive saved 2k for emergency funds that i haven't touched and will keep for anything i may need and now im in the positive range of bringing home extra money which is great. The downside however is of course the 75 hours a week of working, its truly exhausting and now that i've paid my debt off i feel myself losing more and more motivation to continue this as the burnout is literally making me hate my life and i don't like this negative feeling, so much so that i feel it effecting my current main job which revolves around customer service which i don't want to snap at anyone or anything, but im afraid that may happen with just one bad thing happening.

&amp;#x200B;

I love my main job, I work as a Front Desk Agent at a hotel, i love customer service and i love meeting new people across the world, along with working at the breakfast attendant, and help with housekeeping. I'm full time there and my managers like me, along with giving me the schedule i like. I love all that i do. but I only get paid minimum wage and 5 days a week.

My second job on the other hand, i've been with for an extremely long time, i only get 35 hours a week and i work 6 days a week and i make 50 cents less than minimum wage. I. hate . this. job. I mainly hate it due to how long ive been there, how i grew to dislike working there, and how alot of co-workers i loved working with, quit and now new management is more strict and unfriendly, along with being unfamiliar with new co-workers, and how there is absolutely no room for advancement, raises, and the fact that i just hate doing the same exact thing for so long with next to little or nothing to show for it outside of a below minimum wage paycheck.

&amp;#x200B;

I really want to quit my second job, but the hard part is i don't know if i can get by solely with one minimum wage job, and if i can, i can BARELY make it and thus i would have to rely on my emergency funds or credit cards in case i do need something like for example, car tags, or if god forbid an actual emergency. However, its hard to find time to get job interviews as i work at my other job so its hard to squeeze in the opportunity to find new work. At the same time, i also want to work really hard on my artwork commissions, along with my webcomic via tips and such, i have a small following but id really want to focus on marketing moreso and creating more content that can maybe bring in the small portion of money a month to make one job enough, (such as maybe 200 dollars a month). This is extremely tough to bring i know, but i really want to dedicate the time and effort to make it happen. I would also probably find a new second job perhaps, less hours thats for sure, but i can't with these 2 jobs as i cant squeeze time for the interviews they give me if i do get one.

&amp;#x200B;

My question is, would this be a smart move to do? I'm not quitting my day job, im keeping my main one, but getting rid of the second job would cut my finances in half and although id be able to cover my expenses, i would either BARELY get by, or dig into my emergency funds to get by the months.

personalfinance,Defaulted College Loans,"Afternoon! o/

This is about my college loans. I'll try to be as detailed as I can. If you have further questions to help clarify anything, feel free to ask.

I graduated college in 2016, with 3 loans. HESAA, Sallie Mae &amp; Federal (myeddebt.ed.gov). I have no problems with the first 2, as I've been paying and bringing it down gradually. The issue is with Federal. I have 14 different loans with Federal, totalling $74k when I graduated...I put the loans in deferment, as I could not pay after I graduated. When I landed my first job, I started paying...for a year. Brought it down to $64k. Then I left my job and couldn't pay for 3 months, until I landed my second job. I couldn't meet payments, so my federal loans were defaulted. My contract was up at my second job, and I was out of work for 5 months and couldn't pay, putting a huge hit on my credit score. 
As I was waiting for a new career, I did uber in June of 2018 until November 2018, because I signed up for loan rehabilitation to get my loans out of default. The plan they gave me was to pay $329/month for 9 months straight, and I'll be out of default. After 5 consecutive payments, I found a new career, and moved from NJ to FL. I couldn't pay Nov and Dec because of relocation, but I made sure to communicate that to Federal, and the lady over the phone said it was alright, as long as you keep paying after you settle in. I started paying in January 2019, giving more than $329, thinking it would make up for missing a couple months. Not the case.
On April 10, I received a call from the Professional Bureau of Collections of Maryland Inc., but I didn't pick up. It wasnt until April 17, that I finally talked to them, to find out Federal transferred my loan to them, and I have to start paying them, and that I now owe  them $75k. 
I paid, what I thought was my 9th month, on April 11th, which Federal happily let process, only to find out after a call that my rehabilation was cancelled for missed payments on Jan 7th 2019. 

I was at $62k remaining on April 11th, and on April 17th, I find out that my loan was transferred to a collector and increased to $75k. I was told by PBCM, the increase is because of fees and interest...is this normal? 

No one called or emailed me from Federal (myeddebt.ed.gov) to tell me my loan rehab was cancelled in Jan. I found out after calling on April 26th, 2019. Now I have to start the loan rehab over, with a new collector, and higher loans than I started with. How is it possible my loans jumped up from $62k to $75k in a week?? 

Any thoughts/advice is welcome.

I am trying to make some changes to my debt.  I work in IT and I make $70k  a year.  I messed up hard in my college years, went to a for-profit art school and changed my major a bunch.  I also didn't commit to classes, goofed off, and borrowed additional money to pay for expensive laptops and such that school loan advisors mentioned/suggested.  I owe about $110k in college debt and I don't even have a degree because I couldn't afford going anymore.  The loans are split among three places.

&amp;#x200B;

I also owe about $17k in credit debt (Chase and Capital One) both card around 25% APR.  I am paying slightly above the minimum payments for both ($50 extra per) which is $550 a month.

&amp;#x200B;

So:

&amp;#x200B;

1100 for college

550 for credit

900 for rent

&amp;#x200B;

And plus various other bills (car insurance,  cell phone, etc, savings).  After all that is done, along with budgeting for gas, food, and other things I am left with abouttttttttt...... $250 a paycheck (bimonthly) for just me.  That really isn't....terrible.  I would like to try to invest more money into my debt so that I could pay it off quicker...or lower the payments in general.

&amp;#x200B;

I have two things in mind.  

&amp;#x200B;

One, consolidate as much college debt as possible.  Citizens Bank offers consolidation for a decent amount for people without college degrees, but I am open to other suggestions.

&amp;#x200B;

Two, consolidate my credit cards...or take a different loan with a smaller APR/Minimum payment.  Upstart has decent quotes.  


I am open to other suggestions as well.  I can also provide my budget spreadsheet I made in Google Docs",finance

personalfinance,Preparing to refinance Private Student Loans,"Hi personal finance I am looking for some advice. I currently have about $55,000 of private student loan split up into two loans from Wells Fargo. The interest is about 8.9%. 

I’m currently in a in-school forbearance that ends in December and can be extended as I’m in school full time and also am working at nights. There is currently no monthly payment. My income after paying all expenses every month is about $1600.

My main target is it refinance the loan with another lender to try to significantly reduce my interest rates at the end of the forbearance period. 

So how can I best prepare to refinance in the next 8 months. My credit score is in the 650s.

My plan was to try to boost my credit, I just got my first credit card this month, and will be paying all the charges off immediately and basically using it as a debit card. 

Then my secondary goal was to reduce the size of the loan. However, the loans have about $9,000 included of interest charges. So putting the $1600 a month to it wouldn’t reduce my total balance. Just the balance on my interest total. Which the 9% isn’t applied to. I was thinking of taking that money and putting it in a high yield savings account and at the end of the year paying a large sum of the loan. 

Then refinancing with my hopefully higher credit and lower loan rates. Does this seem like a good plan? Am I missing anything? And what are some good places to refinance to a smaller rate.

Thanks

personalfinance,Consolidation loan the way to go to pay off debt?,"I have two credit cards at are nearing their limit. I want to be able to pay them off as quickly as possible. I do have other debt (student loan) that I'm making the minimum payment on every month and will be tackling that once I get the credit cards under control.

personalfinance,Credit card consolidation loan offer has similar APR as my lowest interest rate credit card. Is it worth doing?,"Basically the title here.

Some background (sorry for relatively rough numbers):

I have 3 credit cards: 1 just under $10k and almost maxed at ~17.5% APR, another best buy card with about $1.3k that is interest free until Nov 2020 (high APR after that, planned on paying it off before the end of the 0% promo period), and 1 kohls card with ~$200 on it with a high APR.

Annual income is ~$37k, credit scores range from 697-735 depending on the source.

I was seeking loans for $11.5k to pay everything off at once. I applied and subsequently was denied by Lightstream, and SoFi and Marcus couldn't offer loans after soft inquiries. 

After a soft inquiry, I have been pre-approved by Discover Personal Loans for $11.5k for terms of 60 months ($285.74/monthly) with an APR of 16.99% and 72 months ($262.60) with an APR of 17.99%. Also was approved for 48 months, but I really cant do a monthly payment greater than $300 due to other bills/budgeting. My goal for my budget was as close $250/monthly payment as possible. These quotes are subject to change once I put in the full application and hard inquiry, though the service rep I spoke with says that is very rare

Should I pull the trigger on one of these offers? The 60 month loan seems like the no-brainer here as I'm saving approx .5% APR while also freeing up my credit cards. However, the 72 month is closer to my monthly budget goal while adding approx .5% to my APR. Am I better off asking for less and just paying off the ~$10k to potentially get a lower monthly payment/APR? Am I better off taking the longer term loan with lower monthly payments but higher APR, and making bigger payments here and there as I go? Are the APRs so close to current credit card that I'm better off not taking a loan?

My overall goal is to get 1 easy payment a month and clear all credit debt with the intention of never using credit cards again or as minimally as possible lol

&gt; For now, there’s no cause for panic. The strong U.S. economy and low unemployment means most consumers are able to stay current on debt payments -- new foreclosures and bankruptcies fell to the lowest level in at least 15 years in 2018. Yet the uptick in card losses is unmistakable. Credit-reporting company Experian Plc said some of the blame goes to banks offering credit to riskier borrowers, and the Federal Reserve has noted a spike in late payments by the elderly.

&gt; “We do see card delinquencies a little higher and a slight uptick in the most recent couple of quarters,” Matt Komos, TransUnion’s vice president of research and consulting, said in an interview, adding that he doubts the trend is a harbinger of bad news for banks. “Delinquencies, while moving upward, are probably hitting a more normal level for the amount of credit that’s out there.”",finance

personalfinance,"Not really sure what to do, any and all suggestions welcome.","So I’m going to try and explain this INSANE situation I’m in the best I can. 

PA resident(Allegheny County) have been for the last 12 years.
Loan office in Youngstown OH, closed now HQ in Atlanta GA. 

I purchased my car outright June 2017 with cash. ($12,000, 2016 Honda Fit) September 2017 rolls around I’m in a financial pickle, and as my identity was stolen a few years back, I had to use one of those awful title loan joins with a stupid interest rate for $1,000. Never the less, I kept up on my payments until August 2018, I was $91 behind(house flooded, had to deal with some extra financial burden)  w/ one payment left, they repo the vehicle. (I owed them a grand total of $321 to pay the vehicle off) I had to suck it up, luckily it was pay week, and I have an understanding landlord. I pay off the car and the repo fee. I’m given “loan satisfaction paperwork/pay off paperwork and sent on my way to the repo lot to pick up my car. They were supposed to mail my title back certified mail (to be signed for) I never received it called a few times and then got swamped at work and honestly, completely forgot about it until yesterday.

This brings us up to date... 

I go to a local notary to renew my license plates/registration renewed, which is something we have to do annually here. The lady informs me my plates are coming up as “moved out of state” but doesn’t tell her where to, BUT still shows her all of my information (year make model my address etc) which she says is incredibly odd, and she hasn’t encountered that before. Usually if transferred out of state it will say where but not have the information for the vehicle/owner. So as it was 5:45pm everywhere was closed I wake up and start calling anywhere and everywhere at 8am. I call PennDOT they’re getting the same thing, sent it off to their investigators 3-5 day turn around. They look up my title and inform me there is a lien against my vehicle from loan sharks, and it appear my plates have started the transfer to Ohio but it was never finished.

I call the number for the loan sharks, and they will not tell me ANYTHING. I confirm everything regarding my identity and am met with, oh well forward it to our office (I mean I thought I called the office but ok) and I inquire what should I expect in the way of follow up, phone call, mail, email, should I call back? The guy tells me again he’s forwarding everything to the office. I tell him this is no satisfactory, my car was paid off 8/28/18 there is 100% no reason they should have a lien on my vehicle until 2023 let alone at all, furthermore they need to mail back my title. He said he’ll forward everything to the office and something would be mailed to me....

I called the Ohio BMV they have no record of my VIN, title, plates. Which is even more perplexing. 

My car is officially illegal to drive, not registered to anyone or anything, my plates don’t exist, and nobody can help me. I have no idea what to do or where to turn, I need my car to get to and from work everyday. 

Help! Please. I literally have a paperweight with wheels and an engine. ANY HELP SUGGESTIONS WELCOME. Places to try and call or anything tbh. I’ll take anything I can get.

EDIT ADDITIONAL INFO: per my loan, and just in general. Loan sharks had ABSOLUTELY no right to my plates period as there were sole property of me, NOT my car or them. In PA a plate stays with you until you relinquish or transfer. So they had no legal right to even think about doing anything with my plates. They are my responsibility to maintain when there is a loan, lien anything regarding my vehicle (I.e. you go to your neighbor car dealership and finance a car, you own the plates and have to maintain legality on them even if there if financing on your vehicle, and you don’t technically own it, the bank does)

- Top off Emergency Fund to $2500  
- Apply for Refinance for auto loan (been one year since purchase)  
- Call car company to stop advancing due date when I pay extra  
- Drop $5000-$6000 into highest APR loan  
- Increase payment on highest APR loan to $700 on top of monthly minimum  
- Avalanche Method

personalfinance,Reputable Life/Disability Insurance Companies,"Hello PF,

&amp;#x200B;

I've recently started looking into life/disability insurance coverage. The most important thing I'm looking for is a reputable company with great customer service. If my wife or I are ever in the position to need to use one of these types of insurance, the last thing I want either of us to have to do at that time is fight with an insurance company to get the payout we were promised when we bought the policy. 

&amp;#x200B;

Yesterday I had a consultation with an adviser from Northwestern Mutual. Overall the meeting was pleasant, I didn't get any sales pitches force-fed to me and he seemed to be listening to my desires for my plan (I went in thinking I wanted to ladder term policies that would net around 2 mil if my wife or I were to meet an untimely end, dropping part of the coverage after 20 years (when our kids would be on their own) and keeping 10 additional years which could be added toward retirement if one of us passed)). As we approached the end of the meeting I agreed to schedule a medical exam for my wife and I and the adviser suggested that we would approach our needs with a 20 year term plan + what he called a ""term-80"" plan, which would replace lost income that my wife or I would have brought in later in life (the 20 year term plan is the in case of emergency break glass if one of us dies while our children are still fully dependent on us). I asked a few follow up questions and the more we spoke about this term 80 plan the less I liked the sound of it. For one, if my assets aren't in order by age 70, life insurance isn't going to save me. For another, it sounded like the premiums go up as you get older (ugh). And then the last bit of information he glossed over was something about investments in a life insurance plan with a return rate of 3-4% which can be used to replace bonds in an investment portfolio so you're free to leave your other assets in stocks. That last part of the conversation really gave me a bad feeling. 

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to getting home and sure enough some online research lands me with some very mixed feelings about Northwestern Mutual. They either seem to get 5 star reviews, or 1 star reviews, and I'm having trouble sorting through if the 1 star reviews are just customers that made bad decisions or a true reflection of the company. Either way I'm probably off this term 80 train and more interested in stacking a 20 year policy on a 30 year policy if available as our assets should (job stability, market history holds up etc) be in a good place by 2040. So follow up questions would then be:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Has anyone worked with NWM and have any feedback, positive or negative on them as a company (especially if you have had to use the policy?)
2. What are some suggestions for other reputable companies I should investigate
3. Am I right to have a bad feeling about this ""term-80"" plan. (almost positive about this, but more feedback never hurt)
4. Anything I should know about disability insurance (I've done less research on this topic than on life insurance, but it seems given probabilities of getting injured vs killed almost makes disability more important)

We both earn ok salaries I think. I’m 28 and make about $90k a year, she about 50k. We pay for everything in cash: rent, bills etc. I’m paranoid of credit cards and debt, and I would prefer to avoid one if possible. I’ve never taken a loan, or even set foot in a bank in years. I’ve had no need. 

Side note: I do have student repayments still, but that comes out of my salary directly to government (Australia). I don’t believe that’s treated like a regular loan here. 

We have about $35k in savings at the moment. Unfortunately we don’t have more because we spent a lot on holidays, a new car when hers broke down and of course Uber Eats and tech toys for me. 

But I am worried we won’t get accepted for a home loan or get massive interest rates with no credit history. Should I get a credit card and buy groceries etc on it then just pay it off right away? Do you have to do this for a long time to build credit score?

Do banks look at other stuff like employment history (6 years same company), salary etc when calculating loans?",finance
Bitcoin,"Would you rather have the most powerful unbiased network in the world protect your into-money-converted-time, or a group of humans who promise to take good care it?","Bitcoin's Proof-of-Work seems like a no brainer to me. It doesn't matter if it consumes a lot of energy, it's where the energy comes from that matters. But that's not Bitcoin's responsibility. Blame people using coal over nuclear, don't blame Bitcoin.

To give an idea of how powerful the Bitcoin network really is, an excerpt from The Bitcoin Standard, written by Saifedean Ammous:
&gt;""The reward to nodes for verifying transactions has proven to be a profitable use of processing power. In January 2017, the processing power behind the Bitcoin network is equivalent to that of 2 trillion consumer laptops. It is more than two million times larger than the processing power of the world's largest supercomputer, and more than 200,000 times larger than the world's top 500 supercomputers combined. By monetizing processing power directly, Bitcoin has become the largest single-purpose computer network in the world.""

personalfinance,Real advice sought on overall financial picture,"My wife and I are both 29. We live in a middle cost of living area (large Midwestern city, but not Chicago). I am a lawyer making $130k and my wife is a teacher making $52k. I’ve always considered myself a frugal person and thoughtful when it comes to money, but recently I have developed an almost constant, nagging feeling that we are doing something wrong, living outside of our means, and/or are not doing enough for our financial future. I am not a hardcore FIRE person, and I am OK working until I’m 65, but I really don’t want to be worried about money all through my 30s, 40s, and 50s. Below is a summary of our financial picture and other random thoughts about money. I look forward to your candid advice and discussion.

Income: Our combined take home pay after taxes, health insurance, and retirement contributions is approximately $8800 per month. We pay our credit card in full every month, and keep about $1-2k in our checking account and about $10k in savings (i.e. emergency fund). We do have debts (car, student loans, and mortgage) described in more detail below. 

We generally live comfortably on our salaries, but our monthly surplus always finds places to go (mostly DIY home improvement projects, weekend getaways, extra debt service). I track our cash flow using Personal Capital and, assuming no major outlay for major home improvement projects, we generally have positive cash flow of about $2000 per month after expenses and servicing debt. So far in 2019, we’ve acquired several new pieces furniture, built a new deck, visited friends on the west coast, and had some drainage work done, so our 2019 cash flow to date is just barely positive. 2018 was also an expensive year (wedding, honeymoon, and house purchase).

Our $10k savings/emergency fund is not a full 6 months of expenses, but it is enough to cover any unexpected expense with the house or enough to get us by if one of us loses our job. I recognize in the unlikely event we both loose our jobs at the same time, we would be into trouble really quickly. Ideally, I’d like to build our emergency fund to $15-20k with time.

Retirement Savings: We max out my 401k each year ($19k/year) and contribute about $100 a month to my wife’s 403b each month. These contributions are all “pre take-home income,” so do not factor into my cash flow analysis above.  The current value of my 401k is about $45k and my wife’s 403b is $5k. My wife also has the benefit of a state teacher’s pension that, after 30 years of service, will provide 75%-80% of her final year’s salary for the rest of her life. Pretty sweet deal assuming the state pension system remains healthy and she decides to teach for a full 30 years. If she chooses to stop teaching, her “account” with the pension has a “cash value,” but I don’t know its current value.

Mortgage/House: $262k @4.625% on a 30-year mortgage. PITI (+PMI) is $1822/mo, but ever since purchasing the house we have paid an extra $350 in principle each month. If we keep this up long term we effectively have a 20-year mortgage. The purchase price was $285k with 5% down, and we have $262k remaining on our mortgage. The value of the house has increased slightly, probably to $290k or $295k. I was nervous putting only 5% down, so the extra payment principles each month have been good for me. We will definitely keep up the extra payments until we get to 25-30% equity, but then we’ll probably reevaluate. 

Other Debt:  We have more “non-mortgage” debt than I am comfortable with, but it has taught us several valuable lessons in recent years. Most importantly, that we will never have 2 car payments again!

•	Husband’s Student Loans – $15k remaining @ 3.3% - We pay $387 per month. I borrowed this money from my grandma to fund law school, which has worked out very well for both of us. Basically, she got to help her grandson out (without just gifting the money) while making a higher rate of return than she could have made in the market at that time. I saved 3.4% over the federal student loan rate. Anticipated satisfaction: December 2022.

•	Wife’s Student Loans - $19k remaining @ 4.4% - We pay $600 a month even though the standard payment is $220. Anticipated satisfaction: Mid 2022.

•	Wife’s Car - $11k remaining @ 1.7% - Standard payment is $320 a month but we pay $420. She bought it new in 2016 and we plan to drive it until it dies (12+ years minimum). Anticipated satisfaction: Mid 2022.

•	Husband’s Car - $8.8k remaining @ 2.7% - Standard payment is $500, but we paid $750-1000 a month for many months. We recently reduced payments back to $500 because the loan is paid down to about 1/3 market value or 1/2 fire-sale value. I have an old beater SUV as well, so this car isn’t absolutely necessary, but I am a car guy and this one is cool, so I like having it around. I’ve thought about selling it payoff some of our other debt. Anticipated satisfaction: Early 2021


On one hand, I feel like we are doing pretty well for basically starting at $0 three years ago. One 401k is maxed, debt is all low interest, we have positive cash flow even while paying close to $1000 a month extra towards debt. I tell myself that our situation will be really sweet in 2022 when only the mortgage is left and we’ve freed up over $1900 a month in debt service, but I also recognize this windfall may never happen if kids are in the future or work opportunities change. 

On the other hand, part of me feels that we got ahead of ourselves and that we ought to be making more progress building our overall net worth/financial future. I recognize some of the “tightness” in our budget is self-inflicted from the cars and by making extra debt payments, but I always imagined we feel more financially comfortable by now. I also feel some pressure to keep up with the Jones too (fortunately, not from my wife, though). We are probably in the top 5% of 29 yo income earners in our area, but all of our friends seem to be doing better than us  (i.e. – purchasing rental and airBnBs properties as investments, spouses staying home with new kids, friends quitting corporate grinds to pursue passions, exotic vacations, upgrading to pricier houses, purchasing new cars, eating out A LOT, and more). 

Are we being responsible with our finances? Not responsible enough? Is this my “welcome to the real world, buddy” moment? Lay your thoughts on me!",finance
personalfinance,My savings account's listed APY and interest rate are different,"A little background, I'm new to personal finance and am still pretty ignorant about a lot of stuff, but I'm attempting to teach myself. So I recently moved the bulk of my savings to a high interest savings account through an FDIC insured online bank. The listed interest was 2.45%. My money's been in there for a few months now and I'm getting some decent monthly interest credits so in all I've been pretty satisfied. However today I did a quick calculation and noticed that my interest earned this month was 0.19% of my total savings. Multiplied by 12 months and my annual interest would be 2.26% right? Even taking compounding into account this doesn't come close to the advertised 2.45%. Am I missing something here?

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: Thanks everyone! I knew the compounding part of the equation would make my calculation a little low, but I also didn't take into account the averaging of the month's account balance and the number of days in the month which I'm sure brings the actual interest number up to the advertised APY.

personalfinance,23-year-old needing advice on moving out in expensive state.,"Hey everyone, like the title says I need advice on moving out. I'm a 23 (24 soon!!) old in Northern New Jersey. I currently live at home and have been working since I got out of college 2 years ago. I've recently been more and more eager to move out. My parents are trying to sell their house soon, we butt heads often, I have no space/privacy. 

Rent is pretty expensive if I want to stay within the City (where I work) and commutes can be insanely brutal so I want to stay close. I've been looking near trains since parking at my office can be $13-$20 a day. Basically, it looks like I would be at about $1700-$1800 a month for a studio or 1 bedroom for a 9-month lease. This would include gym access, a parking spot, and a shuttle to the nearby train. 

Let me break down my situation as I've recently gotten promoted. 


**Income/Savings**

* My current salary without bonus: $76K
* Average bonus should be around ~$11K and split across 4 quarters.
* Savings: $5K emergency fund 

**Expenses**

* The biggest is student loans, but I've gone hard on them. technically I'm ""paid ahead"" according to Great Lakes by $30K or until 2029, but I have $22K on a parent plus under my father, and $13K under my name. If I paid minimum I would ow $500 a month, but I put much more each month while I'm home.
* Cell phone: I currently pay my whole families plan since I'm rent-free at home for $125
* Car payment: $300/month. Interest rate is 1% so I pay minimum here. 
* Once I'm out of my parent's house I'll have Car insurance added here too 


I'm really excited at the prospect of moving out. There are cheaper housing options, but they're worse areas, further, smaller, etc. I've also tried to find friends for roommates but since most are working in other areas they want to move further away from my job. Is this a dumb idea?",finance

investing,A decade of Growth outperforming Value,"Could the best explanation behind Growth outperforming Value so significantly since the GFC possibly be falling real rates? Because growth’s cashflows are so far into the future relative to value, falling interest rates would have a higher PV effect. In other words, a 1% fall in a 30 year bond will have a much larger price effect than a 5 year given the higher duration. Could we simply say that Growth stocks simply have a higher duration this benefit more from structural reduction in rates?",finance
personalfinance,Where to focus my savings?,"I have been saving a 1,000 dollars a month, to of course buy my dream car with the intentions of putting a large chunk down to get payments below 300 a month (currently at 12,000 was planning on getting to 15,000 -18,000). I rent a home and my 35,000 dollar student debt payments are about to kick in (6 separate loans at different interest rates and amount).  I guess what keeps me up at night now is that my savings is growing and the closer I get to my goal the more I realize that god that's a lot of money to spend on a car, but damn do I want one. My current vehicle is very old and most likely won't last much longer. Of course I could always get something cheaper or used but I am suckered into the idea of this car. (I know... head vs heart)

&amp;#x200B;

These are my main alternative plans for my savings

1. Do I pay off my student loans as fast as possible (probably smart)
2. Use the money as a down payment on a home  (I'll never see that rent money again)
3. Follow my original goal and get my car then start all over again  (Well then I will have a car payment after)
   1. Buy used / or different car

&amp;#x200B;

My 4th point would be I work in the field that I studied but to be honest I am not passionate about it at all. I'm not miserable at work by any means and I am good at what I do. However, I worry I will spend my whole life furthering other's dreams and always viewing mine from a distance. (Deep right).  So the fourth option is further my savings and use it to start my own business. Of course there is tons of risk doing something like this but maybe it's worth it to try and then fail.

First things first, I’m not the best at making long term financial decisions, so any advice you have would be greatly appreciated! I’ve recently decided to go to grad school and will be getting more financial aid than I need to cover my tuition for the summer term. My tuition is roughly $4K this semester, and I’m eligible for $11K in loans. I don’t plan on taking out the full $11K, but I want to take out a couple thousand extra to help pay off some of my current credit card debt or auto loan. My husband and I are hoping to be able to purchase a house in about 8 months when our current lease is up, and I’m trying to lower some of my higher interest accounts now at the suggestion of a realtor. I know that it seems counterintuitive to pay off one form of debt with another, but the student loans will have lower interest rates than my credit card debt for instance and it would allow me to save more short term for a house. I recently got a new job that pays much better than my previous job, and I plan on making even more when I graduate from this grad program. Does it make sense to take out a little extra in student loans to help knock down some of the higher interest stuff, or should I just keep steadily chipping away at my auto loan/credit cards and only take out enough for tuition?

Bitcoin,TOL: In the past couple of years we've shifted from 'BTC is experimental' to 'When moon?',"***Thinking Out Loud:*** **In the past couple of years we've shifted from 'Bitcoin is experimental, and may fail' to 'Mass adoption is just a matter of time - it will happen eventually'.**

*(The above is how I actually would have liked I'd had written the title, but it would be too long and probably wouldn't be fully visible in the listing page; this is the abridged version)*

&amp;#x200B;

I say ""in the couple of years"" because that's how long I've been down this rabbit hole, so far.  Through these couple of years during which I've been researching and learning about Bitcoin - both the technicals (reading the whitepaper and following updates; also I have a Master's degree in CyberSecurity and work full-time in this field) and the economics (Andreas M. Antonopoulos and Saifedean Ammous) - I feel like in my opinion, and in the community's opinion as per my perspective, we no longer worry that Bitcoin may fail. This new monetary network has been going on in a public, global, decentralized, border-less, and censorship-resistant manner for 10 years. It's been stress-tested pretty well, and has undergone a number of attacks. Still, it fails to go away - and it will never go away. If there's a problem, someone will solve it. This is the sentiment I have towards Bitcoin. And I don't feel like I'm alone.

&amp;#x200B;

So tell me. Am I?

&amp;#x200B;

***Update (approx. 30mins later):***

On the other side of the coin, maybe the community has shrunk. Maybe we've got our heads stuck in the sand, and meanwhile most people bought Bitcoin high and sold it low, losing tons of money, and interest in Bitcoin and this 'ponzi scheme'. Maybe this is the truth, but I've developed an obsession towards Bitcoin, that I fail to see past this foggy and delusional lens. Maybe it's just a handful of whales pulling all the strings, and most of us in the community are their peasants. 

&amp;#x200B;

Satoshi Nakamoto once wrote:

&gt;It might make sense just to get some in case it catches on. If enough people think the same way, that becomes a self fulfilling prophecy.

And he couldn't have said things better. Maybe it's only a few of us pumping this thing up for ourselves - a small community (although in truth, it's kinda working; over the entire lifetime of Bitcoin, there's only a small number of months during which someone who would have bought Bitcoin and held ever since wouldn't be in profit right now). 

&amp;#x200B;

Truth is, it's a crazy and weird world we live in. Or, it's me who's crazy, and my view on the world is very different to that of the norm. I can vision the world changing within the next decades, where the majority of the world is aware of and educated on Bitcoin, and can revert to it if they choose to - being an option which people can rely on. A global currency, with all it's good and it's bad. Very few people can vision this world though. Most of the time, it's just me and my thoughts. And maybe the community's too.

personalfinance,Should I settle this student loan debt or pay in full?,"I know there are a lot of posts like this here, but I can't seem to find one that relates directly to my situation, or answers my question.  Maybe you lovely people could please help me out here:

&amp;#x200B;

# Summary:

I defaulted on a Federal student loan.  The US Department of Education referred it to *Central Research, Inc.* for ""the purpose of securing payment.""  I called them today to discuss paying in full, and they mentioned that settlement is an option as well.  I know that the difference between the settled amount and the full amount will be considered taxable income.  I know (90% certain) that it will show up as a settlement on a credit report, and that's a bad thing.  However, it's entirely unclear how bad this is.  

&amp;#x200B;

# Additional info:

The full amount is $14,841.85.  (Principal = $10,668.05.   Fees and costs = $2,255.47.  Interest = $1870.20)

&amp;#x200B;

The settlement they offered (without me even asking or negotiating) is $11,600.00.  If my research is correct, this is the best offer I can get (unless maybe I hire a lawyer, which I don't think would be worth it for this amount).

&amp;#x200B;

My parents offered to help me pay this off (I'm extremely lucky), after which I'll repay them.  They can pay the full amount, but the roughly $3,200 difference isn't exactly negligible, to them or me.

I also want to get a car sometime soon, as my current vehicle is about 15 yrs old, and I wouldn't be the least bit surprised if yet another expensive repair is coming soon.

# Questions:

**How bad is this ding on my credit going to be?**  The only thing in the near future that it may affect would be a loan for a new car, or a credit check if I move into another rental property.  (For the car, I'm looking at something around $15,000 maybe, and might be able to cough up a sizeable down payment.)

&amp;#x200B;

**Can I ""pay for deletion"" if I settle?  Or only with the full amount?  Any idea how much extra that would be?**

&amp;#x200B;

And of course, the general question:  **Should I pay in full?  Or settle and risk the ""ding"" to my credit?**

&amp;#x200B;

Any help or insight would be greatly appreciated!",finance
personalfinance,[Employment] Crossroads between investing in myself or investing in my sanity.,"First thank you for your advice and taking the time to read this. So I am almost 30 years old and was not finanically responsible until the last two years. My finanical picture is: 

CC debt is as follows: 

CC 1: 3500 at 6.5 percent 

CC 2: 4800 at 0 percent for the next 20 months. 

Student Loans debt: 10495.00 at 6.5 

Mortage is 83,397.14 at 3.85 

Now I never got my degree, like an idiot I goofed off, dropped out and went into the work force. I made great money, but saved very little. I have about 2K in liquid assets and 15K in my 401k at work. My base salary is 50K a year.  Now that you have my background my question is. My current job I hate, it is selling to people basically. I have actually excelled at it for the two years I have been wtih the company. I have always wanted to get promoted since I started, but my boss and my boss's boss have drug their feet on promoting me. No hardtime lines, when I ask about what more they want to see they give me the general answer of more x and y, but I am beating people in our company in both categories. I feel like I need  get a degree in order to be competetive in the job market or at least to find a job. Many of the jobs require a degree i find in my area. My company offers free education re-emburisement if the degree can be used for the company. I like finance, computers (limited knowledge) and business. Should I tough it out and hate life for the next 3 years to get a degree free basically or get out this job and just be a student again full time?

CryptoCurrency,The Bull is right around the corner. What low cap Alt Coin or coins do you think will yield incredible returns?,"My picks are VeriCoin and Verium Reserve. This is why: 

&amp;#x200B;

VRC and VRM are both independent chains not dependent on each other in any way. They each have their own unique protocol which are designed to maximize security and decentralization. When the consensus and coins are paired it will only benefit miners, stakers and users. Transactions will be faster, blocks will be more decentralized, miners can earn both VRC and VRM, capacity of the system will increase and scale. In addition to forming a digital mini economy of it's own.""

\- In other words, by linking a Proof of Stake chain (Vericoin) with a Proof of Work chain (Verium Reserve), you get the best of both worlds. A Proof of stake coin that is more secure than any other (Vericoin) and proof of work coin that is faster than other proof of work coins (Verium Reserve). Also, VeriCoin currently pays a pretty sweet daily interest rate since it's proof of stake. From my experience, you earn about 1 coin per day per 1,000 coins staking... which isn't hard to acquire since each coin is currently 12 cents. 

&amp;#x200B;

The market cap on 5/2/2019 for VeriCoin is just under 4 Million, and for Verium Reserve is just over $400,000.

personalfinance,"Girlfriend is trying to buy a car from CarMax and they are being incredibly adamant about how bad it would be for her to get a co-signer and that she should definitely not get one, even though her credit isn't great.","My girlfriend's car finally bit the dust mechanically, and it would be about $1200 to get it fixed when it Bluebooks for about $300. Obviously time for a new car, and it wasn't a total surprise, just a little sooner than anticipated. Anyway.

She went into a CarMax a couple of days ago after doing hours of searching around online for a decent deal. Its a 2018 Mitsubishi Mirage with I think 36k miles for like $9,999 or something in that ballpark. She knows her credit score/history isn't great, somewhere in the 650s, so she asked her father (who lives halfway across the country, as do I, so I haven't been with her in person for any of this) to co-sign for her, as CarMax told her over the phone that he can co-sign and make a down payment by just being on the phone to verbally agree and go into his local CarMax and sign papers and make the down payment. Her father has objectively great credit and makes good money. 

So after we had a solid plan, she went into CarMax to buy the car, and she said that the sales lady continually insisted that getting a co-signer for the car would be way more trouble than it's worth. Saying things like ""Are you sure you want to get a co-signer? You won't really save that much on APR and then you have to worry about them not wanting to give up half-ownership of the car later."" and ""I've seen it work out very badly for most people when they get a co-signer, I wouldn't recommend it."" Repeat ad nauseum. 

So my gf, not being a very confrontational person, said okay after the sales lady assured her that even if they did the sale today without a co-signer, she has a 3 day (maybe longer?) grace period to return the car if she isn't happy and get a full refund, etc. So to make a long story short she got a roughly $12k loan with an almost 13% interest rate. I told her seems really not good, and she agreed, she didn't feel very good about the whole transaction.

So my question out of all of this is mainly: Is this sales lady full of crap? I've never heard of a dealership advising against a co-signer. It usually goes the other way, where they tell you that they essentially can't get you a loan without a co-signer if you have bad credit. I can't tell if I just simply don't understand something about this situation or if something sketchy is going on. Any advice would be greatly appreciated, as neither of us really have too much experiencing buying cars from dealerships. Thanks in advance friends. Feel free to ask any clarification questions, its a lot to type out and I'm sure I've missed something.

TL;DR: Dealership is strongly advising against a co-signer for someone with relatively poor credit. Something feels very not right about it.

EDIT: For clarification, its actually a 2017 with 47k miles. Also, the 12k price included an extended 5 year warranty and gap insurance. Just wanted to clear that up after she corrected me.",finance
stocks,Wells Fargo allowed me to open brokerage account then put restriction on it because (they said) I am a foreigner (VN),"Hi reddit,

I am from VietNam and I have been working in US on J1 visa for 18 months now. Back in Mar 2019, I opened a brokerage account with Wells Fargo and started trading stocks (buying mostly). About a month later, without any notification, Wells Fargo has put a restriction of my brokerage account and right now I am unable to transfer money in and out of my brokerage account or trading stock. I was told from the Wells Fargo Advisory officer that I need to provide them my US green card before they can lift the account restriction. I asked them the evidence for such regulations and they said it is the Fed. laws. I think this is bull-shit because:

1. I have known someone similar to my immigration status and they are able to trade stocks and pay tax, so it should not be Fed. law.

2. If that was the case, then why did they allow me to open the account in the first place? and after I have put a lot of my saving into stocks they banned it?. For clarification, I did provide them my visa/passport, Driver license and SSN, and I also asked them if a foreigner legally working in USA (with SSN) can trade stock and they said I was ok.

I would be very much appreciated for any suggestions/advices on how to move forward with this.

personalfinance,"Need help! What are my boyfriend's options? Trying to sell car, but too broke to even pay title fees.","My boyfriend has a a rough year of bad luck and has just been stuck in a financial rut. He struggles with depression and other mental health issues, and has been laid off from his last few jobs. Right now he has absolutely no money, no health insurance, and his car insurance and phone bill are about to be cut off because he can't pay it. He doesn't even have money to pay for gas. I told him he needed to sell his car so he could have some money. 

We estimated that he could get about $10,000 from selling his car. He would use that money to pay off bills, debt, and pay for trade school so he can start a job that he will enjoy with decent pay. The problem is, the title is in his dad's name, so he needs to first get a GA license (currently still has FL one) and have the title switched over to his name. There is one other thing he has to do that I don't remember. It'll take up to 30 days and almost $100 that he doesn't have. 

So now he needs money to switch the title so he can sell the car to get money he desperately needs. It's just been a never ending cycle.  Plus having no gas and no phone service due to not being able to pay. It's really put a lot of stress on me as well. He's had such a hard time finding a job, which is why he's going to trade school so he can finally get back on his feet. If he was just able to sell the car immediately, it would solve nearly all of his financial issues so he could get back on his feet. 

Does anyone have any suggestions/tips about dealing with selling a car, so he wouldn't have to wait 3+ weeks?  Taking out a loan is not an option because of high interest rates and his credit score. He knows that if he doesn't figure something out soon, he will have to move out so I can find a roommate to split the rent with. Any ideas would be greatly appreciated!! 

Also- his dad won't help him out at all. They don't have the best relationship right now. 

TL;DR - Boyfriend is depressed and completely broke. Needs to sell car for money, but needs money to have title to switched to his name first. The whole process could take weeks.

personalfinance,Trade down to a different car to eliminate debt,"Put the flame-thrower down, I know I haven't made the best of decisions in the past when it comes to cars. They are my passion, I've accepted that I'll always have a car payment and I like nice things. That being said, when I bought my Grand Cherokee Summit 3 years ago, I knew I could make the payments, I just hadn't considered any longer term financial goals. 

Long story short, I owe about $34500 on a 2015 Grand Cherokee Summit V6 4x4 (that I do still love, btw) that's worth $24k on trade and hopefully something around $28k if I sell it myself. Nothing is wrong with it and it's in fantastic shape. The reason I still owe so much is because my previous car (also great) was a leased Ford Fusion. It was my first time leasing, I drove it too much and I was terrified I'd have to write a check for $3-4000 and hand them the keys at the end of the lease. So, about a year early, I just rolled my remaining lease payments into the new loan (the GC was a manager's demo with 4400 miles on it, so they lopped a decent amount off the price) thinking I'd rather pay all that additional money over a period of time than have to come up with it all at the same time. And at the same time drive something I like even better than the Fusion.

I'd like to trade into something that has already depreciated much more than the Jeep (the car in question, 2015 Hyundai Genesis Sedan. I'd only really consider that top top top trim with a V8.) and at the same time take a typical 5 year term out, so that my payments go way down and I can focus on paying for part of my wedding and then saving to buy a house sooner (to stop throwing money away renting.) I understand that there's still negative equity that's got to be dealt with, and I'm wondering what you all think might be the best way to accomplish this.

Here's my current thought:

Sell the Jeep for no less than $27500

Get a personal loan (@ probably 5-7%) to pay off the remaining $7000 (and release the Jeep's title, obviously) $168/month for 4 years

Get a badass deal on the exact Genesis I want (easily around $24000, I would hope to even get as low as $22-23000) $400-437/month for 5 years

Then the combined monthly payment is $568-605, instead of the small mortgage of $812/month that I'm currently paying.

&amp;#x200B;

I'd love to just roll the negative into a the new auto loan (easier to pay 1 than 2, and the interest rate is probably better), but I was told by one dealer (when we were talking about trade-in value, not selling the Jeep privately) that I'd have a hard time getting picked up for more than 120% of what the ""new"" vehicle books at. So for example Genesis books at $24k, I have $7k negative, banks only want to pick up below $28800 and I'd be trying to finanace $31k at that point.

investing,Is now the time to start trimming your positions?,"Obviously the last couple days have been a bit rough for the market. Nothing about our current situation is normal. Inflation is absurdly low for this stage in the economic cycle while unemployment is also at record lows, not only in the US, but in the entire devolved world. Fed has paused rate hikes for the entire year as of now which has preceded past recessions by anywhere from 1 month to a year, not sure about specific range.

The amount of sovereign debt with negative yields is surging this year, approaching levels seen in early 2016. German 10 year yield is at fucking 0. Pretty clear that shit is out of wack right now, definitely not ""business as usual.""
10 year treasury yield is stagnate even with a massive rally in equities. This is very unsettling, in a healthy bull market you should expect them to be rise during a bull run in equities.

financialindependence,"""FIRED"" unexpectedly due to disability","I'm on a throwaway as at this time I don't feel comfortable discussing my disability on my main account. I hope everyone understands. 

Today I'm FIREd unexpectedly from my disability at age 27. I'm a software engineer in SoCal. Five years into my career I was diagnosed with narcolepsy type 1 with cataplexy. It really hit me young and came out of nowhere. I've exhausted all the known treatments available and those aren't working for me anymore.  I'm really lucky to have been apart of this community for over 5 years and had taken people's great advice here on getting private disability insurance. So thankfully I'm fully protected financially. 

I'm putting ""FIRE"" in quotes as quite honestly, I'm not financially independent. I'm financially dependent on the disability insurance companies to continue paying my claims and not fight me. I estimate in 12-15 years I'd be financially independent and won't ""need"" insurance money anymore. However, I'm no longer working. Today I got my approval for social security disability and have been on claim for a while on my private policies.

A bit about my disability. Narcolepsy is a rare disorder, only diagnosed in 1 out of 2,000 people. Doctors think there is a 4x undiagnosed rate - 1 out of 500. It's still widely unknown why it happens. What is known is that there is a lack of the chemical hypocretin in the brain. Hypocretin is produced by the hypothalamus. It controls the sleep cycle. In my personal case I mostly dream every night, I'm always in REM sleep. I never enter deep sleep on my own without medication. Deep sleep is necessary for your body to feel refreshed. I enter REM sleep in a matter of minutes while a normal person takes about 90 minutes to enter REM sleep.

Since I can enter REM sleep in minutes I don't even know I've fallen asleep. I've fallen asleep to talking to people, in meetings, even talking to my own doctor. I have a lot of ""automatic behaviors"" or doing stuff I don't know what I'm doing. I've done some really weird stuff like putting Thanksgiving turkey meat leftovers mixed in with our raw vegetables, cellphones in freezers, ice cream in cabinets, etc. The real scary thing is from my perspective ""everything is fine."" It's really scary as it feels like you're losing your mind. Since these are dreams I literally have no memory of these events, so I feel like I've misplaced everything and can't remember where things are. My memory is actually fine - its just I had fallen asleep at that point in time then my brain erased the memory as it was a dream!   

I feel like I've been awake for 24-48 hours constantly without sleep no matter how much sleep I get. I have to nap 1-2 times a day every single day.

I've exhausted all possible known medicines to treat my case. I started off with the stimulants modafinil. It had the opposite effect for me - made me even sleepier. It had unbearable side effects for me - my teeth were constantly grinding even awake unless I consciously thought about it. Then being put on heavier stimulants are worse - like adderall which is literally legal meth. Those have high risk of abuse from dopamine triggers, and your body builds up tolerance quick. It's a ""get me through this day"" solution and not for long term use. 

Then I'm on Xyrem for sleep. I have to take it literally in bed. I have to set an alarm clock to wake up in 4 hours after sleep to take a second dose. I don't have much flexibility in my sleep schedule. Oh, and Xyrem is legalized GHB - the date rate drug. So for a ""normal"" day for me I'm popping ""meth"" and ""GHB."" Fun. Goodbye alcohol. Taking alcohol on my medicines will literally kill me.   

As far as cataplexy goes mine is very mild and it's very hard to notice. Cataplexy is a sudden and transient episode of muscle weakness. Basically I lose control of my facial and neck muscles. My triggers are mostly anger emotions. I'm fine with other emotions and laughing. My head droops and that's about it. 

I also have thermoregulation control issues. I'm constantly running a fever of 101 degrees, but it comes and goes randomly. Tylenol seems to help. I also get chills frequently. Imagine throwing on constant flu symptoms of fatigue on top of sleepiness and that's a typical day in my life. 

We're not sure why it hit me. Generally narcolepsy is seen early in children and most diagnoses are in pediatrics. It's unusual for an adult to be diagnosed. It's hard to get an adult sleep doctor that knows about this disease. I was able to get through uni fine with a 3.9 GPA, no warning signs, or anything else. Totally normal. There are only three theories right now: A. simple late onset. B. I had a bad flu 4 weeks before my narcolepsy symptoms started (h1n1 antibodies were present) and either the flu or my immune system attacked neurotransmitters in hypothalamus that disrupted hypocretin production, or C. I had a stroke in my hypothalamus region 1 week before my symptoms started. I went in to my doc about an ocular migraine, no headache, I had 1 week before my symptoms started. I never had those before. No other stroke signs. I'm still fighting the insurance at this point to approve a costly MRI since I have no other symptoms. My doctors don't think it will be much use either at this time as I'm stable, but quite honestly, I'm scientifically curious as to how it occurred. 

My financial picture is this:    
    
* Age 27, male, single but have a boyfriend.
* Was making $125k base salary + 401k match + bonuses + stock options. Total comp: $150k      
*$50k annual expenses    
* Base salary take home pay after taxes before expenses: $93k   
* Total comp after tax take home: $109k   
* 54% savings rate ($59k/year saved.)     
* $200k net worth.   

My insurance policies are:      
     
* $6,000/mo tax free to age 65 individual policy that keeps up with inflation (6% COLA - cost of living adjustment)       
* $2,000/mo tax free ""retirement protection"" individual policy that is owned by a trust. I don't get access to the trust until age 65 or 1 year no longer disabled. 
* $6,000/mo group policy before being reduced by social security ($3,400 after SS.) ($2,500/mo taxable before SS, after SS taxable amount is $1,416). I bought up my policy and the bought up part is tax-free. Unfortunately no COLA in the group policy.     
* $2,600/mo social security   

Disability insurance details:   
   
* It's a true own occupation policy. I took out all the riders on the $6k policy except catastrophic disability. 6% cola, to age 65, residual/recovery benefits.
* The $2k/mo policy was a way for me to get 100% coverage. Since I can't touch the trust until age 65 there is no overinsurance issues and the insurance company were happy to write the policy. They gave me a policy equal to my 401k contributions + 401k match. I have 100% investment control over the trust and can invest in any publicly trade-able security through a brokerage and as long as I don't use margin or borrow against it. The trust is approved for level 2 options trading (selling covered calls, selling protective puts, and long calls/puts, no spread option trades.)     

Income going forward:    
     
* Monthly tax free income: $9,984     
* Annual tax free income: $119,808     
* Annual taxable income: $16,992 + $31,200 social security = $48,192.
* My combined income for social security tax purposes is at least $32,592, so it seems like 50% of social security will be taxable, so it seems like I'd have $32,592 of taxable income for tax purposes.
* Estimated annual federal tax: $1,561   
* Estimated CA State Tax: $397
* Total take home pay before expenses: $166,042.
* New ""savings rate"": 70%

Reading over IRS regulations it appears the $1,416/mo taxable group insurance amount lets me make a $6,000 a year traditional IRA contribution, so taxable private disability insurance counts as earned income for IRA purposes. So without that contribution I'd have $2,493 in federal taxes. 

So right now I'm pretty much at 110% total comp replacement with these policies (132% base salary replacement), and due to the tax advantage nature I'm at 152% total comp take home replacement. However, my group policy does not keep up with inflation, so over 15 years at historical ~3% inflation it will be at half the value. So 15 from years $3,400/mo turns into $1,700/mo and so at that point my future estimated post inflation monthly payment is $12,300($147k annually). Assuming the same favorable tax policies in the future I'm now at 98% total comp replacement and still coming ahead on base salary.

Financial wise it looks like it was an easy decision for me but in reality it was a very hard decision. Why? **Opportunity cost:**

A 5 year career in software engineering is just the beginning of a career. Before my disability hit me I was interviewing at all the Big 4 companies - Facebook, Google, Microsoft, etc. I was getting repeat trips. I was on my third flyback onsite at Facebook. With higher base salaries, RSUs, etc., $300k - $400k pre-tax total annual comp was not out the question for me. Or hitting it big on stock options in a startup on the next Uber. I really wish I could keep working. Unfortunately I'm simply unable to continue working. 

If I go back to work for a period of longer than 2 months I lose out on my group policy. I'd need to endure at least 1 year of work to be covered under a new group policy to not have my narcolepsy be treated as a pre-existing condition. At this point there is no way for me to get through another year of working. It's too risky. Plus being out of work for so long at this point it'd be hard to get interviews and even interviewing or being on LinkedIn can risk my current claims. I really hate to say it but unfortunately once on claim disability insurance encourages people to not work. 

Also, the group policy is only 2 years of own occupation. Then it reverts to ""any occupation."" So I may be in for a fight for it as even though social security is ""any occupation"" case law holds that just because you're on SS doesn't mean you're approved for ""any occupation"" insurance. Since group policies are under ERISA the insurance company is assigned ""discretionary authority"" by the company to interpert their contract for them. So they can very well try to stop paying and it could take a year or more of court battles to get it. And going to court you won't get much from it - just your unpaid benefits reduced by your attorney fees. No punitive damages are allowed in ERISA cases. I really doubt they'd fight me on this, but there is a non-zero serious risk of delayed or no payments under the group policy. 

Our culture in general is so ""work until age 65+"" focused. One thing I love about the financial independence subreddit is people have a strong desire to work on their own terms. My parents can't imagine me retiring early in the first place and are still having a very hard time understanding that I've stopped working. Before the disability hit they told me my goal of retiring at 45 was ""too young."" Now they're telling me ""you're too young to be disabled."" I feel solace in this community's counter culture of saying fuck work. Shooting for FIRE myself helped me make this decision. Being used to a 50% savings rate helps me cope with disability, especially if my group plan doesn't pay in the future. 

Having gone through this myself my advice to you is: **buy private individual disability insurance.** Buy at least enough to fully cover yourself if you throw your group policy in the trash. Most people is already covered under a group policy so I understand it's hard to buy more or justify buying more, but really, you should. There are options out there like setting up a financial trust for it to get more coverage that insurance companies are willing to take risks on. I just suffered a financial loss of millions of dollars of future earned income and I'm lucky as hell my policies jumped in to protect my biggest asset.

worldpolitics,ELI5: When is part of a political unit allowed to leave?,"Note: This discussion will not address whether splitting up a state/country/nation/kingdom/empire/whatever is a good idea, this is strictly about whether it is allowed or not. The wisdom, or lack thereof, is an entirely separate issue and I do not want it derailing the discussion of the ethics of the situation.

---------------------

Britain is attempting to separate from the EU. Fair enough, everyone seems to agree that they have the right to do so, and I don't live there, so it's none of my business.

Scotland is attempting to separate from Britain. They got to hold one referendum, but that was before Brexit, and Scotland voted overwhelmingly against leaving the EU. They are now asking for a new referendum, which the British government is refusing.

Catalonia is attempting to separate from Spain, although not necessarily from the EU. This is not allowed for some reason which is never explained; the criticism is always about the motivations of the independence movement, not about the legality of the act, yet when they held a referendum, the Spanish government refused to accept it and put people in prison for trying.

Crimea is especially baffling; originally part of Russia (to be fair, so was all of Ukraine, but much earlier) up until the 1950s, the USSR put it under Ukrainian management as a goodwill gesture. The population is 90+% Russian, the dominant language is Russian, and when they held a referendum they voted overwhelmingly to rejoin Russia. The media would have us believe that it was illegitimate, though, again, without explaining why.

--------------------

Secession is unconstitutional in the United States. Why? Because the Supreme Court ruled that it was unconstitutional.... in 1869, 4 years after our Civil War ended. Secession is not mentioned anywhere in the constitution, and the Xth amendment is explicit in that anything not mentioned in the constitution is the right of either the states or the people more generally. Texas v. White, the decision making secession unconstitutional, was based on the preamble to the Articles of Confederation, the predecessor to the constitution, and by interpreting the word ""perpetual,"" to mean, ""permanent.""

The only common thread I see determining whether the action is legitimate or not is whether or not it is beneficial or advantageous to certain groups of people.",finance

ethereum,Contract to Lend or Borrow Ether,"I am creating a contract that will allow someone to earn a fixed income on his Ether, and will allow someone else to pay a small interest rate to ""borrow"" their Ether in the hope that the \[USD/ETH price\] will rise.

Unlike the current ""interest-earning"" methods, the Depositor won't have to place their money in a 3rd party wallet, and they can earn any amount of interest that is offered by Borrowers.

Unlike the current ""leveraging"" methods, there is no situation which would cause the Borrower to suffer any loss other than the interest they have paid.

**If you were the \[Depositor\], what is the lowest interest rate you would be willing to charge?**

**If you were the \[Borrower\], what is the highest interest rate you would be willing to pay?**

Here's how the contract would work:

1. \[Borrower\] offers to pay any Depositor \[X% APR\], for a deposit of \[Y Ether\], for a maximum of \[Z Days\]. He deposits that amount of interest into the contract (referred to as \[InterestDeposited\]).
2. \[Depositor\] accepts the offer, and deposits \[Y Ether\] into the contract. The USD/ETH price at that time is referred to as the \[Initial USD/ETH price\].
3. On a daily basis, \[Depositor\]'s balance is incremented by \[X% APR\], and \[Borrower\]'s balance is decremented by the same amount.
4. \[Borrower\] can cancel his agreement with \[Depositor\] at any time. His remaining \[InterestDeposited\], and any profit made by an increased  \[Current USD/ETH price\], is returned to him.
5. \[Depositor\] can cancel his agreement with \[Borrower\] at any time. His balance (the interest earned, plus the current value of \[Y Ether\] **not greater than the \[Initial USD/ETH price\]**), is returned to him. If the \[Current USD/ETH price\] is greater than the \[Initial USD/ETH price\], then \[Borrower\] receives that amount as his profit.

For example, if the Deposit was 1 ETH, and the \[Initial USD/ETH price\] is $160, and at the end of the agreement the \[Current USD/ETH price\] is $180, then \[Depositor\] would receive .888 ETH (which would still be worth $160) plus interest received, and \[Borrower\] would receive the rest of the original 1 ETH (0.1112), for a profit of $20 (minus interest paid).

personalfinance,Am I paying these loans right?,"I’m 23 and graduated last year. I came out with about $22k in student debt. I’m making $70,000, with a net of $3,763 monthly after maxing 401k, $1,500 to HSA. 

Currently I’m sitting at a student debt balance of $14,500 with an avg. interest rate of 4%. I have $6,200 in my savings which covers over 3 months of expenses, and I’m always able to keep at least $1,600 in my checking account after bills each month. I have another $3,000 in a personal 401k. 

My necessary expenses total to $1,500 monthly, then I’m currently putting $800 to student loans, $500 to cash savings, and $200 to personal 401k. I generally spend another $500 on frivolous things like travel, eating out, going out, and random spend. That leaves me with an additional $233. 

With these current spending and saving habits, it will take me approximately 18 months to pay off this debt, but at the end of those 18 months, my cash savings will be $14,000, and my 401k will be ~$4000.

I'm currently studying at University once again (Biomedical Science) and am unemployed. I'm not looking to take up a part time or casual position as I've found from my first degree that the unflexible time requirements and pressure to work shifts when the business needs led to a reduction in my course results. I'm intending to study a further post grad once I complete this second Undergrad degree so my results will be of importance.

That said, I have a BSc. Applied Mathematics and Statistics and have had 4 years of experience in a unique analytics position at the Casino in my city.

product analysis to optimise performance in relation to both cost to customer and floor allocation

budget planning in relation to purchase of new product and targets for each financial year as well as areas of cost savings with respect to RoI

bulk customer analysis with respect to implementation and altering of strategies to invigorate overall business as well as individual patron analysis

business cases for new strategic concepts not prior utilised

general reporting of data in a clean and consistent manner to General Manager and Executive level staff to keep them briefed of important facets without requiring them to have to dedicate their own time to understanding the data, ie. provide quick but detailed insights as situations change throughout the week / month / year in the business

My reviews at this job were consistently at the level considered ""Outstanding"".

My question is, what kind of work could I offer that there would be an interest in / market for, how would I go about finding clients and advertising my abilities, how much would I charge / how would I charge, by hour or by quote for a project.

I currently am looking for work as a Maths tutor for High School age kids (easy stuff to start off with as I've never tutored before), but I've also prior considered whether there's a market for Excel based tutoring (management of data, formulas, tables, etc.), or for general report production for small businesses.

Any assistance offered is highly appreciated as whilst I have these capabilities, I don't exactly know what other people would find of enough benefit to pay someone for.

I'm employed full-time, make 17hr and have a 650 credit score. I don't have much of a credit history. The total loan is $16,000 which the dealership quoted me at 377 a month over 72 months. I am also aware that 72 months is a long time and do not expect to take on a loan for that long. My question is when you do the math though it comes out to like $11,000 in interest which is 69% over the total span of the loan. How is that 12% interest? Shouldn't it be $1,920 if it's 12% interest a $16,000 loan. I haven't bought the car yet and I know it's great deal for the year make and model but the interest rates make absolutely no sense. My mother bought a Mercedes sprinter van at 1.9% for her business and her monthly payments is exactly 1.9% interest of the total vehicle over the total span of her loan. Why is it different for me? Side note this car is not from a BMW dealer but they are BMW licensed, when I went to an actual BMW dealership it was worse they said 14.75 but again the interest over the total span of the loan was not actually 14.75.

Forex,Overall Market Behaviour,"**G10 Currencies**

This week we experienced moderate to high volatility on all major currencies. The analysis in some cases meat or exceeded expectations while others failed. In some of my ideas, we all saw the strategies that fail but also the ones that reached the targets. 

This overview is not a strategy but more of a fundamental breakdown of what to expect next week.

**UK's Brexit**

The biggest winner this week is the British pound. Investors became more relaxed with Brexit since the Conservatives and the Labour Party are close to an agreement. That said, whatever the agreement it still has to pass the Parliament vote and of course, the EU needs to agree with it so, it's not a DONE DEAL by any means. Moreover, we need to remember that the Labour Party wants the PM T. May Brexit deal to fail and that raized the uncertainty in the market for the pound.

**The FED's consistency**    

Even with more than half voted for an interest rate hike, didn't happen, pushing the dollar down. Investors were highly disappointed by the rather dovish influence after the FOMC meeting. Fed's Chair Powell, avoided discussions of possible scenarios where the will cut the interest rate but emphasising more on the inflation rate. After his statement, the votes changed to 56% in favour of rate cuts, but it might change as we progress towards the next FOMC meeting.

Last push for the US dollar remains the NFP release today at 15:30 PM (GMT+3), with somewhat bearish sentiment judging only by previous numbers and forecasted ones.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/51m6asy4cyv21.png

**Euro Zone**

Not much to say here besides some great macroeconomic data for some countries that didn't make the Euro stand above the US dollar and some of the other majors. Confusions and contradiction from both investors and analysts regarding the overall GDP, PMI, inflation and interest rate decisions. It is worth noting that interest rates in the Eurozone haven't changed since May 2016.  

Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, plays a safe game by not increasing the interest rates but keeping inflation low by cutting the quantitive easing (printing of money). Some say that's the recipe for disaster but so far he reduces it by 60%. 

**Australia and New Zealand**  

Both suffered the biggest drawback from all of the majors against the US dollar, due to weak and incorrect macroeconomic data. The same data published at the bigging of Q1, 2019, the correction on their forecasted expectations were short by 1,1% in GDP growth and also unemployment rates. These two economic indicators are enough to shake the confidence of investors, pushing the currency on a bearish trend.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

personalfinance,How do loan repayment charges work?,"My situation is, I currently have a loan out of just over 11k for around 4 years. The interest is 5k. I have the intention of paying back most of this early so that I don’t pay the full interest rate. I’ve read the contract given to me by my bank but I’m a little confused on early repayments, hopefully someone here can give me some advice. The contract states the following... 

“In common with most consumer loans you will have the right to repay the loan early either in full or partially.

* however if you exercise this you will be charged additional interest. This will be 58 days’ interest on the amount repaid early (28 days’ interest if the period of the loan is one year or less) “

The question I have is: 
How do I work out the additional interest amount? So for example let’s say I wanna pay off 5k early ( this would be on top of the monthly payments I already make of course), what do I get charged for that? 

I’m basically trying to workout what’s optimal for me to save the most amount of money and also get out of this loan as soon as possible.

personalfinance,Working Hours: How Much Is Too Much?,"This is a personal question about me - and while I know the ultimate decision is based on ""what is worth it to me"" or whatever, I'm just looking for advice.

&amp;#x200B;

Background: I'm 30 with a stay-at-home wife and 9mo daughter.  Wife is stay-at-home because we BOTH want her to be and we do plan to have more kids...just don't know the final number yet.  I work in healthcare as a medical provider working four 9 hour days, for a total of 36 hours of clinic.  There are 4 hours of ""admin time"" built into our schedule for paperwork and other crap, but I tend to be VERY efficient and get all of my work done in each 9 hour day.

&amp;#x200B;

Budget: Ignoring our mortgage and my student loans, we budget \~$22k/year in ***expenses***, and end up pretty close (slightly above or slightly below).  We fully fund both our Roth IRAs and my HSA - anything leftover at end of year goes directly to work 403B.  Unfortunately work doesn't have 403B match right now, but they are ""looking into it...""  We also are saving $12k/year in daughter's 529 plan.  Lastly, we already have \~$300k in retirement savings, with zero debt other than mortgage and student loans (note, interest rate on both mortgage and student loans low enough that it mathematically does not make sense to pay off early while forfeiting investment returns). 

&amp;#x200B;

My income completely covers our monthly budget, including the retirement/HSA savings, and my daughter's college funding.  It is relatively tight, but we do have some fluff in our budget and are looking at what makes sense to cut, and my student loans will be gone in less than 5 years (basically a $10k raise at that point...).

&amp;#x200B;

I currently have the opportunity to pick up extra shifts, making extra money at an hourly rate.  This helps, but is sporadic.  There may be an opportunity to somewhat permanently increase my hours by approximately 9hrs/week to increase my income 20-25%.  This would take me from working only 4 days/week, to switching between 4 and 5 days/week, and would likely require some weekend/holiday coverage.

&amp;#x200B;

**Question: Would you do it?**

&amp;#x200B;

Of course the money is good, helpful, etc., but is losing that time with family worth it?  Is it worth it to work harder now, missing when your daughter and future children are young, or is it not?

&amp;#x200B;

Lastly, the increase in income would NOT increase our lifestyle!  This money would go directly into work 403B, brokerage account, and maybe a little bit more into daughter's 529 plan.  My goal is to be financially independent at age 40, but I do NOT plan to retire.  Instead, the plan is to simply cut back my hours to the minimum to keep benefits and allow investments to continue growing untouched - contributing when able, but not stressing over it.  I don't hate my job - I actually enjoy it, but it can be stressful, and would obviously be nice to work less with the freedom to walk away if healthcare ever gets to the point of no-return.  So, in 10 years, or sooner, I could stop the extra work and not miss a beat in our lifestyle.

&amp;#x200B;

The math:

* at current rate of savings - at age 40 we would have a bit over $750k
* with 20-25% salary increase - at age 40 we would have just over $1m (which is our FI number, especially with student loans gone at that point, and kid's 529s should be pretty much 100% funded at that point)",finance

personalfinance,"[Debt] Mother and grandmother are combined ~$95,000 in debt, what can I do to steer them towards help and get a hold of dire financial situation","Been lurking here since I started my first full-time job after college and moved to a new state back in September. I've been learning a lot about PF &amp; the tenants of FIRE, along with working on other personal self-improvement goals. I was lucky to be supported by my father through college, along with scholarships &amp; grants, and graduated debt-free, albeit with some personal faults/troubles along the way that have put me kind of in limbo professionally at the moment.

Some context I think is relevant:

I have been learning more about the financial situation of my ~60-yo mother and ~mid-90's grandmother, who raised me as an adolescent and teenager, over this past year. My grandmother moved with my mother and I to a new state ~13 years ago, and they have continued to live together since I moved out and went to college. Near the beginning of last year, in my last semester and since I started working, my mother has repeatedly asked me for money, and I've been sending her between $250~$300/mo for her ""bills"". I have kept this from accruing into a net loss monthly for my own budget, but it's obviously hampering my ability to save/invest. She has been in and out of employment the last 10 years, went back to community college for associate's degrees that have done jack shit (and student loan debt that she gets forgiven since she doesn't have much income), has various medical problems that leaves her unable to get out of bed somedays (even though she gets obsessed with gardening projects, we have to yell at her to not use a shovel or any digging tools...). She has been trying to get on disability and we hired an attorney last week. So my grandmother has been the main source of income for majority of the time, which is her own federal pension &amp; then my late grandfather's federal survivors' pension. 

I visited home this past week and got a pretty detailed picture of the debt in my grandmother's name, which has been fueled I think by my mom and also extended family of mine that were homeless and addicts at different points within the last 10 years, but are much more stable now. This is all information from saved paper statements (grandmother is very old-fashioned, no proficiency with the Internet or any kind of computer) I looked over for the month of April:

Food expense is mainly from Food Stamps. It's hard to tell what my mother's expenses are, but I know she has ~$2,800 of CC debt in her name and ~$12,500 in student loans on Credit Karma report. I've been continually pushing her to drop unnecessary expenses like streaming subscriptions and even Tinder... but she isn't fully listening yet.

Grandmother is worried that by declaring bankruptcy or not paying the credit cards she will lose the house, but I have had presumptions this may not be the case. My compassionate reasoning to helping fix the situation: I love my mom and grandmother to death and want to help solve an issue that they have been unable to address. My selfish, logical reasoning: if my grandmother were to suddenly pass now or in the next 1-2 years shit is going to hit the fan for my mom and she is going to come to me  to pay for her to live... and obviously I don't want to do that. Even though, my grandmother is in very good health for her age, and I have a strong belief that she will live past 100, I understand nothing is guaranteed in life.

I already feel like I am struggling trying to improve myself professionally and personally, I don't want my mother's problems to drag me down but I want to be there for her. My own situation is a bit wonky too, imo, and for my own reasons I am considering moving back in-state and finding another entry-level position in order to be close to them. My current job is a bit ridiculous anyways, but very low stress which is nice.

So who I do need them to get in contact with, a bankruptcy lawyer, CFP, etc.? What is the immediate course of action? Thanks for any and all advice/guidance.

personalfinance,Let's talk about a beater (rebuttal),"Ok, so I'm sure everyone saw the beater post that made it to the front page.  I wanted to respond then, but I was too busy and would've been buried at the bottom anyway.  So just in case you missed it, a guy talked about his dad being a mechanic for 30+ years and made the argument that you are better off just spending your money on a certified pre-owned vehicle(12-15k) as opposed to buying a cheap car (under 5k).

&amp;#x200B;

As a used car dealer I simply couldn't disagree with this line of thinking more.  Before I begin my argument, let me make two important points.  One, if a car is more than a car to you(a show piece, a way to get girls, work equipment, etc.) then yeah, a car is more important to you than the average person and you likely should end up spending more on it since it's more important to you.  Two, I live in South Carolina.  I see 20-25 years old cars with plenty of miles on them that have a ton of life left in them all the time.  I understand the south has much less rust on cars, but at least one or two people a month from NY or New Jersey see my ads on Craigslist and drive down here to get a car.  You may have to bite the bullet and drive a ways to get a good car if you live up north.

&amp;#x200B;

Okay, down to the points and math of everything I'm claiming.  Let's start with the financials of it all since that's the most important part.  Most folks don't have the 12-15k available to just go buy that nice car when they need one so they end up financing.  When you finance a car you lose three times.  First, you pay a higher initial price.  If a car dealer is financing a car for you they aren't going to work with you on the price much at all, definitely not the way they would if you were paying cash.  Second,  you have to pay interest on the money you borrowed... so you don't pay back 12-15k, you pay back 18-20k.  So it's not even really a 12-15k car... its a car worth 12-15k that you are paying 18-20k for.  Third, when you're financing a car they make you have full coverage insurance.  For most of my customers full coverage is about $220 a month vs the $80 a month it is for just liability.  Let's say you pay this car off and drive it for 5 years.  It has costed you 18k for the car and about 12k in insurance.  When you go to sell it you may get $4000 for it at this point if you have kept it in pretty good condition.  So, 18+12=30 and 30-4=26, so it costed you about $26k to drive that car for 5 years.

&amp;#x200B;

On the other hand, I'll use 3 cars I have on my lot right now as examples of cars that I would say are MUCH better deals.  I have a 2000 GMC Yukon with 198k miles that I would sell for about $3500, I have a 2000 Lexus ES300 with 220k miles that I would sell for about $3000, and I have a 2005 Honda Odyssey van with 150k miles I would sell for about $3800.  You have to know a bit about these cars, and cars in general, to understand why these cars would be better deals.  First, you need to understand the engine in the car you are going to buy.  The Yukon has the 5.3 Vortec, the Lexus has the Toyota 3.0 VVTI V6, and the Honda has the VTEC 3.0 V6 engine.  All three of these engines get 300-400k miles regularly(at least in the south).  The argument from people who disagree with me is ""well what about all the repair work you're gonna need on these engines to keep them going that long?!?"".  Well, the truth is, you change your oil and your fluids... but other than that... you shouldn't pay for ANY engine repairs on a $3500 car.  I had a customer call me and complain about spending 300 on O2 sensors on a 3000 car they bought two months earlier.  I said ""sir, do you realize you just spent 10 percent of the price of your car on an 02 sensor repair?"". My last car had a check engine light on due to O2 sensors for 3 years.  It affects very little.  If you run out and fix every insignificant problem or every sensor that goes out then yeah... you're gonna end up spending a lot of money.  When you buy a car at these prices you basically ride them until the engine blows or the transmission goes out, that's the plan.  Like I mentioned before, you keep the fluids clean, you keep decent tires on it, and maybe fix the AC/Heat if it goes out... but other than that you don't put any money into a beater.  I have been in business for 5 years now... it seems like most of my customer get about 2-3 years of use out of my cars before they resell them and come back for another.  So let's do the math buying a car my way.  Lets even say you get unlucky and one car blows up on you so you have to get 2 ""beaters"" to make it the 5 years.  Folks can pay cash for cars this cheap so there is no financing.  That means 3500+3500=7000 for your two cars.  You do still have to pay your 80/month insurance so that's 4800. But don't forget, you should still be able to sell that beater for about 2000 when you're done with it as long as its still running.  So, 7000+4800 =11,800 and 11,800-2000=9,800, so it costed you about 9,800 to drive those cars for 5 years(and that is assuming one blows up on you and you lose it completely).

&amp;#x200B;

So long story short, in the view of this used car dealer, you are MUCH better off buying cheap cars.  So many people just accept that $500-$600 a month to drive a car is normal.  Its crazy, and $500-$600 a month is life changing money for a lot of people.  Of course everyone should do what they want, and I even advocate buying any damn car you want if you have the cash money to pay for it.  But at the end of the day, in my opinion at least, its bananas to pay $26k for transportation for 5 years when you can pay under $10,000 and still get everywhere you need to go!

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: So the biggest argument against my numbers in the comments is the interest rate/ability to get a better price with cash.  First, for those of you who think you get the same deal financing as someone with cash, as someone who owns a car lot, I can tell you that you are just flat out wrong.  The only way you get the same deal is if you have a 3rd party financier like your bank as your lender.  In that case, yes, it is pretty much the same as cash to us, but with one caveat.  It's real easy to negotiate on the spot with someone with cash on hand.  You know they are serious.  Its a 15 minute deal once you've shaken hands until that money is in your pocket. Once you realize someone doesn't have cash on hand it has now turned into like a 2 hour deal where they have to take a trip to the bank and you have to fax paperwork back and forth and all that for someone who may or may not even get approved.  At that point as a dealer you're just kinda like ""this is gonna be the best I can do right now, let's send this number over to the bank and see if we can even get the deal done"".  If they don't like that... meh, let em walk, someone with cash will show up later and buy it.  Second, as far interest goes gimme a break people.  In SC my average competitor in the buy here pay here market charges 23 percent interest.  Lenders like Lendmark and Liberty Financial, charge like 8-12 percent interest.  Even bank loans are like 3-6 percent for people with good credit.  Yall add up how much each payment is X how many times you gotta pay it.  Its gonna be much higher than the amount you borrowed.  Thousands if you are in the ranges we were talking about.",finance
personalfinance,Short Term Savings - What's next?,"Hi everyone - your advice has been so helpful for getting our retirement accounts ready, getting out of debt, and accruing a stable E-Fund.  We are prodigious savers, and I worry that we may have reached our limit of the easy short-term savings ideas. We want to save about $50,000 for a house down payment, so, my question is: what should I be doing next?

&amp;#x200B;

Since some people want the nitty gritty details, I've outlined them below. TLDR is at the end.

&amp;#x200B;

* My husband and I make base a little over $150,000/year. He is slotted to receive up to $20,000 in bonus ($5,000 every quarter if his reviews are right) but we do not fold the expectation of this money into our current financial set up.  His base is just over $110,000 and I make about $40,000.
* Our retirements are fully beefed. He maxes his 401k at the federal allotment, and I have a pension that contributes 14% on top of the 10% I'm required to put in mandatory. I also submit an addition $300/pay ($7,800/year) towards my 407b. Our retirement contribution is about $35,000 each year. We aim to have 2mil by age 60 and are currently on goal for that.
* He has a HSA, I have a FSA. Both are maxed - we use the FSA first for all medical expenses.
* We only live off the income of my husband's take home pay, which is currently $4,778. (His actual take home is $5,778 but $1,000 goes into savings - see below).
* Our bare minimum monthly spending is $2,900. I would say we spend between $3,200-3,800/month on average.
* We have $0 in debt.
* Current savings strategy:
   * We both have an individual high yield checking account at 3% with Lake Michigan Credit Union. Interest accrues up to a max of $15k. **Both of our accounts are just beneath $14k and we need a new way to route and save money.**
   * Currently we are saving $2,600/month into HYCA (2 months of the year it is $3,400).
      * My husband puts $1,000 a month into his HYCA ($500/pay - 24 paychecks per year).
      * I put my entire paycheck into my HYCA ($800/pay - 26 paychecks per year)
* Current savings:
   * E-fund: $20,000
   * Car savings current: $3,300.
   * House fund: $0.
* **Goals:**
   * Car Savings: $10,000
      * We have 2 cars that are both paid off in full. A 2012 Honda Fit  and a 2002 Nissan Sentra super beater is that is rusted inside-out and has the crappiest AC system. The Fit has about 100k miles and I drive it to work 5 miles one way every day, and probably put about 3-5k miles on this car annually. My husband works from home, and if we go anywhere I typically chauffeur him in the Fit haha. However, if he needs to run an errand or meet someone for lunch, he uses the Sentra. The Sentra runs but we have two rules about it 1) we do not take it on the highway or in bad weather and 2) if something mechanical goes wrong with it, we will dump it. The car is probably worth $500-$1,000 but it definitely needs about $2.5-3k in repairs. **We would like to beef up the car fund in case the Sentra dies and we find that we must purchase a stable replacement.** Since we are theoretically a one-car household, there are only a handful of circumstances that having a second car makes sense.
   * House Down Payment: $35,000-50,000.
      * We currently rent. Our rent is $1,200 a month and we love our apartment and complex. We rent a beautifully updated ""studio"" apartment that is just the right size for two adults. To rent a two-bedroom here, we would need to switch from a single-level super updated apartment, to a three story townhome that is not as aesthetically nice where the bedrooms are on the third floor. The townhomes are $1,400-$1,500/month.
      * However, long term, we might try to get pregnant in the next year or so. Obviously, we would need to move from this studio/one-bedroom but if we are going to move, we only want to move once and purchasing a home has been on bucket list for a while.
      * We hope to find a home between $250-300k, which is doable but it will not be in the best school district (it's a good school district) and I would have a bit of a commute, which I am not excited about since I currently drive 15-20 minutes to work in rush hour. In order to purchase a home where I could walk to work and also live in the best school district of the city, we can find a really small, non-updated 2 bedroom 1 bath home for $250-$300. Updated homes with more bedrooms and bathrooms are $300-$360k. If we have a baby, my husband will need a dedicated office (so at least 3 bedrooms). Also, according to my coworkers and patrons, home renos are competitive and expensive in this area with timelines looking at 1.5-2 years to start reno. For cost, simple bathroom renos coming in at 20-30k.
      * At my current estmates, I believe that by saving our base $2,600 monthly we could have $10k in our

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR: We are in a good financial position to diversify our short-term savings goals. We are just about to max out two High-Yield Checking Accounts.  How do we best do it?**

&amp;#x200B;

At my current estimates, by saving our base $2,600 a month, we would have $10k in the car fund by November 2019, and $35,000 in our house down payment fund by July 2020. If we can save an additional $1,000/month on top of that, we could have $55,000 for the house by July 2020. I am really at a loss on how to manage this money effectively.

&amp;#x200B;

My husband has the option of purchasing into his Employer Stock Purchase Plan. The max is 15% of each paycheck which would be about $700/pay or $1,400/monthly. The ESPP will accrue this money for 6 months and purchase the stock at whatever it's lowest value during this 6 month period, plus an additional 15% discount off its lowest price. Even though we will pay taxes on the gains, especially if we sell within (I think) the first year, does this sound like an interesting investment? We are looking at an $8,400 investment, and even if we could get a $2 profit per share, we could easily get $1,200-1500 profit. 

&amp;#x200B;

Also, since we are not looking to spend any money until Summer 2020, we could ideally do the ESPP for an entire year May-Nov, Nov-May. 

&amp;#x200B;

However, even with $1,400/month going towards stocks, we will still have an additional $1,200 that needs to be saved somewhere. Where should we put it? I'm pretty risk adverse, but I know virtually nothing about mutual funds/money markets/bonds/or CDs - all I can garner is that CDs really aren't worth our time since opening another HYSA could accrue more interest.

&amp;#x200B;

Would love any and all suggestions you have about what makes the most sense. Also, housing budget comments are welcomed as well.

personalfinance,Should I refinance?,"Hey everyone. 

Just want someone double checking my math on this. 

Little background information that is relevant. Last year, I purchased my second home ($305K) for more space with a new baby that was on the way. At the same time of the purchase, I was also selling my current home. My purchased home wanted a quick close and would not wait for the sale of my current home(frustrating but understandable). Anyway, I had a lot of money tied up in my current house and other place that I was only able to put 5% down and would require me to have PMI on my new home. Two weeks later, my old house sold and I put all the equity from it into a principle payment of the new house. This reduced my overall loan amount below the 80% LTV mark and was able to remove PMI before a mortgage payment was made. 

Fast forward a year and my loan value is down to $233K. I was messing around on zillow and happen to enter my information into the refinancing and noticed that even if my interest rate stayed the same (4.25%), my monthly payment would drop from $1425 to $1150 with a new 30Y fixed. I understand that this starts over my loan but wouldn't it be worth it in my case to refinance even if there would be some upfront cost? If this ends up working out and my monthly note drops by $275, I would just add it to my additional principle payment ($240) I'm already making to help pay it off quicker. I don't need to lower my monthly payment for finance reasons, just looking to save money in the long run if I can. 

Not sure if it matters but I live in Texas and our mortgage payment is 18% of our take home pay.

I currently have $25K of credit card debt and that caused my credit score to drop to the 630s range. I no longer use my credit cards but would like to eliminate the balances on them and raise my credit score. Because of my low score I couldn't get approved for a loan with a good interest rate. I think the lowest I could find is around 24%. I've already eliminated all unnecessary spending from my budget and only stick to the bare necessities. Right now I pay around 670-700 a month in credit card payments and the loan would have payments of 653. I understand that in the long run I will probably end up paying more with the loan if I stick to the minimum payments than I am on the credit cards but I think I need to get my credit score up a little bit so I can move in a couple months into a cheaper apartment. So my question is, would this be a good move to make or are there other options that I should consider?",finance
personalfinance,Receiving 100k in Life Insurance and State Farm is offering a 3.5% Interest Account,"Title basically says it all.

personalfinance,Best option for moving my debt to a lower interest rate.,"Hello,

A year-ish ago, my wife and I hit a bad situation and accumulated some credit card debt that we had our necessities on. Unfortunately that amount is around $14k now, but we are getting back on track to making payments towards it.

In April we were able to pay $728
In March we were able to pay $600
In February we were able to pay $1200

Right now the interest rate on the credit card is at 15.99%. I am looking into a personal loan or a credit card with a no balance transfer fee / 0% interest on balance transfer for xxx months (is there a credit card that has both?) 

Looking for options on what we can do.

I have a borderline good/excellent credit score.

investing,How do I hedge future interest rates?,"Right now, I have a 3.75% mortgage, which is great. Let’s say the balance is $100k for simplicity. I’m planning on a renovation, and would like to cash out $20k to partly fund that work. Problem is, if I did that my rates would jump due to generally higher rates, a LTV of 80% (75% is more typical in cash out scenarios). So a mortgage broker suggested the following. Get the HELOC at 5.5%, draw on that for a year, when the house is complete get a new appraisal and refi the place. 

Which works out great if rates are still under 4%. But I’m screwed if they’re now 5% or higher, aspecailly as the HELOC rate floats. So now I get to the investor question.

If I wanted to hedge my loan, or get some insurance, what are the paths for that? I’m thinking a contract that pays off if rates are above 4% on about June 1 of 2020, enough that if rates spike to 6% I may get hosed on my HELOC, but at least I’ll pocket a similar amount as the contract will pay off (and I’ll just keep my first mortgage indefinitely). 

What kind of contract would I buy?  Fairly savvy investor, but usually just playing with stocks, ETFs and mutual funds.",finance
personalfinance,My parents are way in over their heads and need to sell their house but are in denial. Need help. (MI),"Where to begin with this one.

I just moved back home with the folks after college.  We live in Oakland County Michigan.  My dad works for a lawncare service and my mom works in some sort of accounting field.  I know I make more than them in my entry level engineering position, but together they probably make more than I do.

They own a 4 bed, 2.5 bath, 2994 square foot house on a high end golf course.  They've never golfed a day in their lives.  They bought this house after the even bigger house they built a few years prior to 2008 foreclosed, and apparently this house was very cheap.  I want to say they bought it for 300k, but I was a middle schooler then. We moved to another state for 7 years and the house was rented out for that time.  My parents moved back into the house Oct 2017, 1.5 years ago.

My parents are in really bad debt. I don't know to the full extent of it.  But my mom uses credit cards like it's nothing, this house's utilities is just about the same as the $1700 a month mortgage, and they owe $4k to the golf course/community for not paying the club dues in 6 months.

I've hinted at them selling the house but they always say they can't right now; they have to wait.  Then they mumble something about taxes and since they haven't lived in the house for 2 years, they will lose money on the sale.  At this point, they have no money so I don't know why they continue to live like this.  

I was hoping someone could help me understand what they are talking about.  If someone could explain the taxes that go into selling a house and how I can calculate the differences in the sales.  I'm really trying to research how to get them out of this situation and into a smaller house that they can actually afford and pay off their debt.  Zillow says the market value for the house is $421k, I don't know if that's accurate, but it's more than the $300k they bought the house for.

btc,"Looks like the Court is fed up with Wright's Tulip Trust excuses - Motion for Protective Order denied, must produce substantial info next week.","https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/6309656/166/kleiman-v-wright/

&gt;The Court has already found that tracing Dr. Wright’s bitcoin holdings is relevant to the Plaintiffs’ theft claims. The order to produce a list of bitcoin holdings as of December 31, 2013, was a compromise; it was the Court’s attempt to provide Plaintiffs with relevant and material evidence without unduly burdening Dr. Wright. That Dr. Wright now argues it is not feasible for him to identify the bitcoin he held on December 31, 2013, does not diminish Plaintiffs’ entitlement to the pertinent evidence. That evidence can be obtained through other means, which the Court will authorize Plaintiffs to use.

That last bit is a little ominous...

In addition to producing a list of addresses, the Court has further instructed Wright to provide substantial information and documentation about the trust, and swear to what he submits. He's not given much time to do so, either.

&gt;3. On or before May 8, 2019, at 5:00 p.m. Eastern time, Dr. Wright shall provide to Plaintiffs a sworn declaration identifying the name and location of the blind trust, the name and contact information for the current trustee and any past trustees, and the names and contact information of any current or past beneficiaries.

&gt;4. On or before May 9, 2019, at 5:00 p.m. Eastern time, Dr. Wright shall produce to Plaintiffs a copy of any and all documents relating to the formation, administration, and operation of the blind trust. The production shall be accompanied by a sworn declaration of authenticity.

&gt;5.

personalfinance,Credit score lowered because library fines were sent to collections; can I do anything else apart from paying the fines?,"I admit I don't know a lot about how collections work, so this might seem like a basic question.

Background: I had massive fines from the library (over $100) because I had books out too long (I know I f-ed up, please don't lecture me about it. There was a lot going on). As soon as I realized that it was sent to collections, I returned the books, which knocked off most of the money, and paid the remainder. The library considers me in ""good standing"" now (which means I don't owe them any money).

Fast forward to today and my FICO score is lower by more than 100 points because of the collections. I had a high score before so I'm fairly upset about this. Since I paid the fines, will my score increase next month? I know collections fall off within 7 years, but I had a hard time finding anything related to my situation.

technology,"Censorship on Twitter, Insta, FB ---- FIX","We all know Censorship is rampant on Social media platforms, and we all need to find a fix for it. 

I would like to brain-storm some ideas here, and deal with a constructive criticism. 

**VERY IMP: THIS IS A TECHNICAL (ENGINEERING) DISCUSSION. PLEASE DON'T MAKE HIS POLITICAL.**

We understand that tech censorship is due to the centralization, and lack of transparency from platforms. 

&amp;#x200B;

We understand the positives of blockchains (decentralization) and censorship resistant concepts. 

Unfortunately blockchains are not scalable enough to host social media platforms at this point (please don't use SteemIt as an e.g here).

&amp;#x200B;

But, if we can use a hybrid system, where Twitter uses the concept of blockchains to resolve who and who not to ban/censor, that can be a positive step. 

&amp;#x200B;

I will use twitter as an example here (Since I have played around with its API to be familiar of hos it works).

&amp;#x200B;

Twitter has a Twitter ID (primary key) associated to each account. 

Now, when an account (or comment) is reported of malicious content. The ""reporter"" account and ""reported"" account are stored. 

&amp;#x200B;

Random numbers are fed in a sha256 generator, until 5000 (or 10000) valid accounts numbers are generated. (Very imp to use sha256 number generator, so we know there is no bias in the account numbers generated).

&amp;#x200B;

These 5000 (or 10000) accounts are sent a survey to determine if reported account or comment is violating the rules. 

Collect all the results voted in specific amount of time (these time spans should be standard i.e permanent banning of account would be 24 hr voting period, temp ban 12 hrs, just sample numbers).

&amp;#x200B;

And base you result in that specified amount of time. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, there will have to be voting karma. i.e If your decision was with the majority (in making a decision), your karma will increase, and vice versa. 

&amp;#x200B;

Also, if you report an account/comment and the voting determines that account/comment didn't violate the rules, then the reporters karma drops exponentially.

&amp;#x200B;

Karma cannot be bought. 

And I think, Karma for an account should be higher if one has more followers. 

This will prevent bots from opening an account with 2 followers, and reporting people. So, the drop in Karma doesnt affect their main account. 

&amp;#x200B;

 There are mutiple loopholes in this concept and design, but I think this could be a doable concept. 

Lets have an intelligent discussion on how we can fix the censorship problems.",technology
personalfinance,Reposession of Father's Vehicle,"Some background information:
My father is a convicted felon who has been out of prison for around 7 years. I am in my late 20s on my way through a moderately successful career in tech.

My father and I are on good terms, although we have a somewhat distant relationship.  Last week, his vehicle overheated and in the days directly following a small electrical fire put it out of commission. 

After pressing him for details, I've come to realize that he has an incredibly predatory financing situation on his vehicle (which he bought for $7k ~1.5 years ago and currently owes $8800 on due to an absurd interest rate)

While he does have insurance, they are only covering the fire damage with a $500 deductible, but not any of the underlying engine issues which may have been the root cause.

He views the vehicle as a money sink due to all of the issues he has had, and is ready to have the vehicle repossessed and deal with the hit to his credit.

Neither he nor I know much about the consequences of having a vehicle repossessed (especially with regards to the outstanding balance on the financing) and cursory google results have yielded conflicting results.

I have offered to contribute a $5000 loan with little to no interest to help the situation, but would like to know how to advice on next steps. Should he allow the vehicle to be repossessed and look for a new vehicle? Try to repair the existing vehicle? Buy new and continue paying the outstanding balance?

Apologies for the ignorance on this matter. I appreciate any insight that anyone could provide. If anyone needs any more details I am happy to provide them. That said, this is a throwaway as there are some potentially personally identifiable details in this story.

submitted 10 minutes ago * by gazstevens73

Neurochain aims are to create a completely new, sustainable ecosystem based around the technologies of blockchain and AI by developing and unlocking cutting edge technology.

I would hope you all have a good understanding of what blockchain technology is by now, simply put, a digital filing system using distributed ledger technology to encrypt data and thus creating a tamper proof database which can only be updated by those with permissions via private keys.

Artificial Intelligence however may not be so obvious to some. From Neurochains perspective it is seen as creating an ecosystem that will utilize machine learning, neural networking and big data processing using bots(nodes) to seemingly learn and perform tasks effortlessly and efficiently. The more data they are fed the more they will learn and the more intelligent they will eventually become.

Distributed ledger technology due to its cryptography is an inherently secure way of storing data however it is currently very slow and requires the brute force approach to confirm any transaction, even POS by comparison is relatively slow.

Neurochain is aiming to solve this issue, and, may have already solved it using its unique consensus method Pii and Proof of Workflow. The algorithms behind it are quite complex and can be thoroughly investigated in the whitepaper, but it is clear to see that the technology is there and with Main net just weeks away the proof will be in the pudding as they say.

Running on bots (Neurochains equivalent of nodes), Neurochain is able to reach consensus using a lot less power, so much so that a bot will be able to run on something as simple as a mobile phone. “Bots are made up of four layers.... communication layer, security layer, a layer which is the copy of the neurochain blockchain, and a creation layer for creating new blocks. With those 4 layers we have a wallet which holds the ncc token. The ncc token allows you as a bot owner to buy business applications on the network just as you would with an app type store. Bots are open source and can be downloaded by anyone.

All the Bots are connected, and they can leverage information coming from the other bots. In this way the concept of machine learning is producing a collective intelligent network. When all these components begin communicating with eachother the information becomes more and more intelligent because of all the collective being collected by the other bots.By combining AI with DLT the Neurochain bots are able to become much smarter and provide much more convenience and value to any applications using them, for example within the medical field they may be able to determine accurate diagnosis for a patient based on the data held about that patient combined with the data collective that has been learned.” Source: Neurochain Telegram Channel

Neurochain is attempting to target initially six industry sectors where they believe AI will play an important future in transforming these areas to become more efficient and secure.

AI and • Banking • Insurance • Public sector • Retail • Logistics • Healthcare

Conclusion Artificial intelligence and blockchain are new and exciting technologies in their own right, but when combined they have the potential to completely revolutionize all aspects of industry. Both together serve to enhance the capabilities of the other and Neurochain aims to be a fore runner in this field.

This is of course my own personal opinion of the project and I am invested, of course as always you should DYOR but for me long term this project will rock the crypto world.

# **Trade talks closing in on finish line as markets weigh inflation data, earnings in week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/03/trade-talks-closing-in-on-finish-line-as-markets-weigh-inflation-data-earnings-in-week-ahead.html)**
*****
&gt; A trade agreement between the U.S. and China could be a strong catalyst for stocks, even though analysts say the market may have already priced in much of the gains.
*****
&gt; Chinese Vice Premier Liu He will travel to Washington for talks in the coming week, and sources have told CNBC a deal is possible by Friday. Trade has been one of the biggest overhangs for the market, but the prospect of successful talks has helped fuel the S&amp;P 500′s 17% gain this year.
*****
&gt; Besides trade in the coming week, investors are awaiting Friday’s inflation data, important after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s comment Wednesday that weak inflation is transitory, signaling the Fed does not now have to consider an interest rate cut.
*****
&gt; That comment from the Fed chief sent markets reeling, since many investors have been positioning in both bonds and stocks for a pre-emptive interest rate cut from the Fed. So Friday’s consumer price index will be key, even though unlike the inflation measure the Fed watches, CPI is expected to show inflation running slightly above the Fed’s 2% target in April. The Fed’s favored PCE deflator had core inflation at 1.6% in the first quarter.
*****
&gt; To close out this week, the April jobs report crushed Wall Street’s expectations— adding a robust 263,000 new hires while the unemployment rate fell to 3.6%, the lowest level in a generation, the Labor Department said Friday. Wall Street had been expecting 190,000 hires and a 3.8% jobless rate.
*****
&gt; “The more robust the incoming data is, the more time the Fed has to sit and watch and evaluate whether inflation is rising this year in the manner that they think it is. If the labor market is good enough, it allows the Fed to be patient, and let this thing play out,” said Michael Gapen, chief U.S. economist at Barclays. Gapen said if the data and inflation is instead weakening, the Fed would have to rethink its position later in the year.
*****
&gt; Disney earnings
&gt; Earnings will continue to be a factor in the week ahead, with about 50 S&amp;P 500 companies reporting, including media names like Disney, News Corp and Viacom.
*****
&gt; But if the trade negotiations are resolved, that will be the event that could have ramifications for markets and the economy for months to come.
*****
&gt; But the reaction in the stock market may initially seem short-lived. “If the tariffs come off, you might get some readjustment to earnings expectations. So, you might have a nice couple of days, but I think it’s three-quarters of the way priced in, maybe a little bit more,” said Lori Calvasina, chief U.S. equities strategist at RBC.
*****
&gt; She said some sectors have already benefited from the prospects of a deal. “The two I think are in focus are industrials and semis,” she said. As for semiconductors, “there’s been such a fierce rally in that space this year. Semis were sort of the pure play on the China fears and they rallied hard and fast. They’re starting to see some profit-taking.”
*****
&gt; The VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF is up 33.4% year-to-date.
*****
&gt; Calvasina said the better-than-expected performance in S&amp;P 500 first quarter earnings shows there will not be the earnings recession expected just a month ago. She said companies focused a lot on cost cutting to maintain their margins. According to Refinitiv, the S&amp;P 500 companies are now expected to see profit growth of about 0.7%, compared to expectations for a contraction of 2% back on April 1.
*****
&gt; “I think the market very much deserves the rally we’ve had,” she said. However, she sees limited upside and maintains a target of 2,950 on the S&amp;P for year end. “We’re getting to the part of the year where we’re vulnerable to bad news. It doesn’t mean today is the top, but when we think about where we’re going to be at year end, it’s a good reason not to raise the target. We feel like we can overshoot in in the short term.”
*****
&gt; “It’s probably a good time to take money off the table. We’ve said that things could weigh on the market in the second half,” she said.
*****
&gt; Investors are also looking towards Omaha this weekend. Berkshire Hathaway was holding its annual meeting this Saturday, and that could generate plenty of headlines for investors who are Warren Buffett watchers. The investor already revealed to CNBC Thursday that his company was a buyer of Amazon.

# Strong Starts Hog Gains for the Year

&gt; Big gains the first four months of 2019 have some Wall Street pundits and analysts concerned. While strong starts for the market for the first four months of the year don’t leave much for the rest of the year, it is by no means a negative implication or bearish indication. S&amp;P 500 leads the pack with its 17.5% gain coming in at #3 since 1950. NASDAQ’s 22.0% gain is the 5th best first four month since 1971. DJIA’s 14.0% rise is number 9.

&gt; In the tables below we have displayed the top 20 first four month gains for the three major U.S. market indices with the subsequent changes for May, Rest of the Year, “Worst Six Months” May-October, 2nd half July-December and full year performance. While most of the full year gains are clearly logged in these big first-four-month gains, there still upside to be had in the latter part of the year.

&gt; As you might expect May is weakest for DJIA and S&amp;P and the Worst Six Months are hit hardest mostly after the strongest starts. The major blemish is course in 1987, with other critical givebacks in 1971and 2011. Other significant issues arose in 1975, 1983, 1986 and1998. Basically, if you take 1987 out of the equation the rest of the year after strong starts aint so bad. Average gains are about equal to historical average annual gains. Rest of the year gains sans 1987: DJIA 7.3%, S&amp;P 500 8.7%, NASDAQ 12.6%.

# Typical May Trading: Just a Couple of Positive Areas

&gt; Once again it is that time of the year where we increasingly see and hear “Sell in May.” But when exactly in May is the “best” time to sell? Based upon the last 21 years of data, the best time could be early in May. The month has opened well, on average, recently with strength on the first trading day and on the second for the most part. Afterwards, DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 all tend to drift sideways to lower until around May’s eighteenth trading day or so. It is on this day the NASDAQ and Russell 2000 begin to rally to finish the month. Beware though, this late-May rally typically fizzles before it can exceed the highs reached earlier in the month.

# The Power of Productivity

&gt; The U.S. labor market may be kicking the economic expansion into another gear.

&gt; Consistent productivity growth has been largely absent from the expansion, even as payrolls and wages have grown at a healthy clip. However, strong labor market trends and last year’s pickup in capital expenditures growth could be sparking a resurgence in productivity, which we think could be key to future economic growth.

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, productivity in the first quarter rose at the fastest year-over-year pace since 2010.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/The-Power-of-Productivity.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Increased business spending is the primary catalyst for higher productivity, as better equipment and training boosts output per worker, although a tightening labor market has also helped. Labor shortages and accelerating wage growth normally incentivize companies to invest in boosting output with current labor. In turn, workers may get paid more as output increases, which could flow through to higher consumer spending.

&gt; Growing productivity also helps offset rising labor expenses, as companies get more output per dollar spent, which can help mitigate inflationary pressures and support healthy profit margins for U.S. companies. First quarter unit labor costs rose only 0.1% year over year, the slowest pace of growth since the fourth quarter of 2013.

&gt; “Labor market strength has been a pillar of the expansion,” said LPL Research Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch. “Job creation and wage growth remain healthy, and increased productivity points to stronger output without significantly higher costs.”

&gt; The April jobs report, released May 3, showed U.S. hiring hasn’t wavered amid global uncertainty and trade tensions. Nonfarm payrolls rose 263K, higher than estimates for a 190K gain. Average hourly earnings grew 3.2% year over year, around the fastest pace of the cycle, and at a level that should continue to bolster consumer confidence and support consumer spending. The unemployment rate fell to 3.6%, a cycle low.

# More (Im)patience

&gt; The Federal Reserve (Fed) has promised patience, but financial markets now want more.

&gt; On Wednesday, Fed members unanimously voted to keep rates unchanged, and Fed Chair Jerome Powell repeated several times in his May 1 post-meeting press conference that further patience is appropriate. That patience, which soothed stocks earlier this year, spurred nearly a 1% intraday selloff in the S&amp;P 500 Index.

&gt; Investors have pointed to slowing consumer inflation as a case for lower rates, and bond markets have increasingly positioned for a rate cut. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, growth in core personal consumption expenditures (PCE), the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge, has slowed in the first three months of this year, falling as the global economy has struggled with trade uncertainty.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Consumer-Inflation-Trailing-Away-from-Federal-reserve-Target.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; While the pace of core PCE growth isn’t alarmingly slow, the downward trend over the past three months runs counter to the Fed’s intentions.

&gt; Still, Powell attributed lower inflation to transitory factors. He also correctly noted that core PCE growth stayed close to 2% for much of 2018, so fundamentals before the first quarter volatility supported the Fed’s inflation target. Producer prices and wages have steadily risen over the past few months, and we expect businesses to eventually adjust their prices accordingly as demand picks up.

&gt; “We think the trend of slowing consumer price growth is temporary and that inflation could pop higher as pricing pressures build,” said LPL Research Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch. “If consumer price growth picks up, we think there is a better chance of a rate hike later this year, rather than a cut.”

&gt; Other parts of the U.S. economy are rebounding, so we don’t see a strong argument for a rate cut right now. At the very least, Powell made it clear that the Fed doesn’t have enough clarity to move policy in either direction, which is prudent given the persistent mixed signals in some data series. For now, the Fed remains in wait-and-see mode as trends settle and growth stabilizes.

# Time to Sell in May? Part Deux

&gt; As we noted earlier this week, these next six months historically have been the worst for stocks. That is why there’s a well-known investment axiom to “Sell in May and Go Away.”

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/The-Next-Six-Months-Have-Been-the-Worst-on-Average.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; However, that popular principle hasn’t rung true for most of this bull market.

&gt; “Stocks have actually risen over this dreaded six-month stretch in six of the past seven years, while the S&amp;P 500 Index has gained in May six consecutive years,” explained Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Blindly going to cash and waiting until after Halloween to re-invest hasn’t been the most profitable strategy lately.”

&gt; The S&amp;P 500 has bucked the seasonal trend recently, but we think a decisive midyear rally could be more difficult to come by this year. With the S&amp;P 500 higher each of the first four months of 2019 and up more than 17.5% for the year (as of April 30), we think a consolidation or pullback could be warranted. As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, over the past 20 years stocks have spent the next several months in a sideways grind.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/The-Next-6-Months-Could-Be-Choppy-1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; The average peak-to-trough correction during these worst six months is 11.1%. With conditions quite stretched near term, stocks could be vulnerable to a potential pullback over the coming months.

personalfinance,Chase credit card without a chase account? Confused as to how it all links together,"I've had a Chase checkings/savings account for over a decade and a 786 credit score.  About a year ago, I opened up a Chase Freedom Unlimited card and have paid it in full every month.

However, due to their abysmal interest rates, I would like to move any money out of my Chase accounts and into my HYSA at another bank.

I'm curious how card and bank account are linked.  Can I maintain my Chase CC but close my Chase banking accounts?  Would this hurt my credit score?  Would it honestly be easier to just keep the minimum $1.8k ($1.5 for total checking + $300 in savings) to avoid the monthly fees?  This rubs me entirely the wrong way if I'm essentially ""forced"" to do this...

In short, want to keep my Chase card but close my account and am wondering what options there are around this.  

As always, very much appreciate the thoughts and advice given here, so thank you in advance for sharing yours!",finance

personalfinance,The state of my finances after almost 3 years of working full-time. How can I improve?,"I've tracked my finances at the end of each month, after expenses, taxes, etc. Basically just the amount in my accounts on the last day of each month: [https://imgur.com/EuCGuNI](https://imgur.com/EuCGuNI)

My liquid balances (blue) include my checkings and savings accounts. I keep around 10-15k in checkings for bills and buying things. The rest is in a Capital One 360 Money Market account that gets about 2.5% interest rate. I put half of my net income into my checkings account. The other half, I put into the savings account and don't touch it. 

My non-liquid balances (red) is mostly my 401k, which I max out by contributing \~18% of my pre-tax income, in a ""traditional"" account. My employer also matches some (I forget the exact matching rules). This value is dependent on market values, which you can tell by the dip at month 30. I also have around 16K in an IRA at Bank of America.

The problem is, if you look at my total balances (purple: blue + red), the graph is pretty much linear with a slope of \~4.8k per month. This means, (unless I get *significant* raises) it will take me \~50 years to reach a net worth of 3 million, which seems to be a good target for early retirement, based on looking at various posts on r/financialindependence. However, 50 years is not ""early"" retirement anymore xD. 

So, how can I improve? I am already saving over 50% of my income, and investing a lot of it. Thanks in advance for taking the time to read this! Perhaps I am just freaking out and worrying too much.",finance
personalfinance,Help dealing with student debt and bills.,"Hello,

Stock price targets are $18-20 range, but based on EPS of around $1.  The company just posted Q1 profit of $0.73, and foreseeable can easily surpass that target, yet not many banks have taken that into account and upgraded their price target.

They’ve just opened RIPIET, with expansion plans, and are well on their way to deleveraging with $1.7bln debt payment.  They’re getting 12x EBITDA on sales of noncore assets, yet are only evaluated at around 5.5x.

Been averaging down on their lows, but this stock seems like a guaranteed winner with upside and high yields.  It’s not as fancy as FANG, but the fundamentals seem to support a huge rebound in stock price, especially with the lower interest rates and favourable FX rate.

personalfinance,Parents buying my student loan debt- anything I need to be aware of?,"My parents are retired. We have a great relationship, they are trustworthy and always have my back. So no concerns there. I owe $20k in federal loans to Navient. Interest rate is 6.875% fixed. My parents will be paying off the full amount, and then charging me 3% interest. I cannot deduct the student loan interest anymore (over the income threshold), so that’s not a factor. 

I feel like this is a win/win- I’ll pay less in interest, and my parents will make more off the money than having it sit in a savings account.

personalfinance,Help With Budget Spreadsheet Design,"Hi All

&amp;#x200B;

I would appreciate any advice you can offer.

&amp;#x200B;

I am currently in the process of creating a YNAB like budget excel spread tracker for my personal finances (i.e. a zero-sum, category based envelope budgeting system).

&amp;#x200B;

**Simplified Design:**

...(excluding the shiny/extra bits)... core tabs, not in order of display, but in order of significance:

&amp;#x200B;

* \[data\]
   * export of my bank statements
* \[activity\]
   * master pivot table of all data from \[data\] tab, by category, and date.
* \[budget\]
   * tab to set and track budgets for each month
* other
   * dashboards etc

&amp;#x200B;

**The problem I need help with:**

I am trying to figure out the best way to design the \[budget\] tab.

At present the design is roughly:

&amp;#x200B;

* left-hand primary column - lists categories.
* Header columns - per month
   * allocated - how much willing to spend within that month.
   * activity - auto pulls data from \[activity\] tabs pivot table on what has been spent already within that month/category.
   * available - allocated minus activity.

&amp;#x200B;

This all works well for the basics of setting a budget and tracking it, what I am struggling with is:

&amp;#x200B;

* how do I best assign funds to a category that haven't actually been spent (and account for in the \[data\] tab which everything feeds from) without causing a disparity?
   * I would want to do this, for example, to add funds to a pot that I may want to accrue over time (which extends longer than one month).
   * If I do this by manually overwriting the amount being fed from the \[activity\] pivot table in the \[budget\] cell, there are issues with this:
      * &amp;#x200B;

1. it will overrule the formula and no longer also count any true activity done in this month/category.

* 2) it may create a disparity with other measurements in the rest of the sheet.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Initial Ideas**

* make a manual entry into a new line on the \[data\] tab 
   * PRO's = will feed across the whole workbook (avoiding disparities) 
   * CON's = if I ever overrule the data in the \[data\] tab (e.g. exporting statements from further back), this would overwrite these manual entries as they only exist virtually. A simple solution to this would be to create them in a separate table which feeds in somehow but is safe and containerised outside of the \[data\] tabs real-world activity statement data.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks in advance and I look forward to any input.

&amp;#x200B;

Let me know if you have any questions.

&amp;#x200B;

I would be happy to share the sheet once it is complete.

personalfinance,Stock grant and mortgage question,"Hi all, looking for some advice, I exercised a stock grant from my company and pulled in approx $26,000, the company had withheld stock from my grant to pay the taxes on it, will I still be on the hook for additional taxes next year? (It vested and I sold it within three months of the vest, I assume I will get hit with it as normal income but wanted to verify.)

The second question is around my mortgage, I have a first and a second, the second is ~90k at the moment on a 30 year schedule, if I were to take the money I received from the stock sale and put it towards the principal do they recalculate monthly payments for the remainder of the term or do they stay the same and you just pay it off early?

I'm asking the mortgage question because I'm looking to get into a better cash flow state and I could use the stock money to pay off a 14k car loan instead and have more money available to me each month to pay towards principal on the two loans.  If they recalculate the mortgage payments  based off of the now lower principal that would lower the payment on the higher interest rate loan and increase my available cash, however if they don't the car seems like the better option.",finance
Bitcoin,Bitcoin derivatives (options) for US citizens,"I'm  a long-term holder of Bitcoin (using a throwaway reddit account for  security) looking for a way to hedge a trade for a couple months, but  I'm struggling to find any exchange offering options to non-HNWI US  citizens.

I found LedgerX, but one has  to be worth at least $5M currently, until they get OmniX approved. And  of course there are lots of exchanges offering margin trading and/or  derivatives to non-US citizens.

Can someone point me to any others?

My  goal is to temporarily obtain a 6-figure amount of dollars for a quick  real estate purchase, while I pursue traditional financing that will  take a couple months to settle. But during that time, I want to maintain  my current exposure to the Bitcoin market. So my thought is to sell  enough BTC to fund the purchase now, and buy a call option that expires  in a couple months, at which point I'd re-buy the BTC.

Options I've considered:

1. Sell the BTC, and buy a call option, as mentioned above. Downside: Nobody currently offers options to non-HNWI US citizens?
2. Sell  the BTC, while opening a long position at an exchange offering margin  trading. Downside: Kraken's margin interest rate is really high, around  22% APR. Are there other exchanges offering margin trading to US  citizens with more reasonable funding rates?
3. Borrow  from one of the new crypto lending companies such as Nexo or BlockFi.  Downside: Somewhat high rates, and a large amount of BTC at risk of  company exit-scam/hack/bankruptcy. I'm not entirely comfortable with  their business model. Hopefully they're properly hedging their positions  if they have to sell clients' crypto to provide the fiat.

Are there other exchanges offering margin trading to US citizens? What other ideas should I consider?",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,I am an independent contractor but I have questions about my rights,"So I have been contracted for 6 months. And get paid a flat rate. I drive my own cargo van delivering products. They gave me a route since day one and it still is the same route. Basically it is the worst route they have other drivers doing the local deliveries. But I got the farthest route. Which is 270-315 miles a day. 
They need me in the morning to load my truck and finish loading by 8 am bcuz thats when everyone is dispatched to deliver. Thats the first red flag. I shouldn't be told when to come. Anyway I like going early so that I finish early. 
They have heavy products weighing 100-150 lbs and sometimes I have to load it by myself because I hate asking for help, unless somebody offers. It sometimes takes me an hour to finish loading all that product. So I feel like im a warehouse worker not an independent contractor.
I sometimes was asked to help pulling products from shelves which is clearly not my job. But the warehouse is insanely understaffed. 
Coming back to the route i have to drive 300 miles almost everyday. Which is stupid because it is the same route and I see the same people everyday and sometimes they only order a piece of tape and the next day they order a small set of nails. And because of that stop I have to drive an hour and a half extra. 

So is it my right to for example to say that I will only do that stop that takes me and hour and a half once or twice a week. Because it is actually wasting time and gas and energy. I dont mind driving the route but I dont feel I control anything. Just everyday thats your stops good luck. And it really doesn't make sense to go every day to the same stop deliverying small stuff when they can order one order. 

So can I for example control that route my way. If i had the option I would do certain areas in certain days. And tell the stores to know when to place the order.

personalfinance,A Quick Comparison of High-Yield Savings Accounts,"As we all know, most people don't really shop around much when it comes to financial products. Even for people who *do*, it can be kind of confusing. Recently, I was helping a friend pick out a high-yield savings account (after they had made a whopping ~$10.00 after having a Wells Fargo savings account for a decade), and put together a list of what exactly is available on the market today. I figured that other people might find it useful. If you have anything to add, feel free, and I'll try to integrate it.

**Highly Recommended**

These accounts all have APYs over 2%--generally what one wants to be looking at nowadays--have virtually nonexistent requirements to open and earn interest, and have no hoops to jump through. All are also with well-known, established financial institutions, have generally average-to-superior customer service, and easy to use websites and/or apps.

INSTITUTION | APY | NOTES
:-- | :-- | :--
Alliant | 2.10% | $100+ balance to earn interest. Must join credit union, which can be done with a $5 or $10 donation to a charitable organization.
Ally | 2.20% | 
American Express | 2.10% | 
Barclays | 2.20% | 
Discover | 2.10% | 
FNBO Direct | 2.25% | 
HSBC | 2.30% | 
Marcus by Goldman Sachs | 2.25% | 
Synchrony | 2.25% | 

**Look Good, But I Don't Know Enough to Recommend Fully**

There are a few high-yield savings account that definitely look good on paper, but, because of a combination of things, primarily lack of information (and the fact that some, like Comenity Direct, haven't even been around for a full month), as well as additional hoops to jump through, I cannot *fully* recommend at this time.

INSTITUTION | APY | NOTES
:-- | :-- | :--
Bank7 | 2.35% | $100+ deposit required to open. $100+ balance to earn interest. $15/month fee if balance &lt; $100.
Comenity Direct | 2.48% | $100+ deposit required to open.
Live Oak | 2.30% | 
Salem Five Direct | 2.30% | $100+ deposit required to open.
TABbank | 2.40% | 
Vio | 2.46% | $100+ deposit required to open. $5/month charge ""after a year of inactivity.""

Note that Comenity Direct and Vio are part of large, well-established financial institutions.

**Worth Considering**

In addition, there are a few other options out there that, based on your particular situation, may be worth considering. Many of these require large deposits to open, large balances to earn a high APY, or have some sort of gimmick (or, in the case of Bank5 Connect, have an APY that's so low that it isn't really worth it unless you have a checking account with them).

INSTITUTION | APY | NOTES
:-- | :-- | :--
Bank5 Connect | 2.05% | $100+ balance to earn interest.
CIBC | 2.39% | $1,000+ deposit required to open.
CIT | 2.40% | $100+ deposit required to open. Highest rate requires either a balance of $25,000+ *or* a monthly deposit of $100+; if neither requirement is met, the APY falls to 1.28%.
Citi | 2.36% | Must be opened as part of one of Citi's five available banking packages. $4.50/month fee if balance &lt; $500. Not available in CA, CT, FL, IL, MD, NV, NJ, NY, or VA.
Citizens Access | 2.35% | $5,000+ deposit required to open. Highest rate requires a balance of $5,000+, otherwise it falls to 0.25%.
Digital Federal | 6.17% | Highest rate is on up to $1,000; anything above that has an APY of 0.25%. Must join credit union, which can be done with a $10 donation to a charitable organization.
PNC | 2.35% | Only available in states in which PNC does not have a retail banking presence. 
Popular Direct | 2.36% | $5,000+ deposit required to open. $4/month fee if balance &lt; $500.
PurePoint Financial | 2.35% | $10,000+ deposit required to open. Highest rate requires a balance of $10,000+, otherwise it falls to 0.25%.

**Conclusions**

As one can see, there are a lot of different options out there when it comes to high-yield savings accounts. There are a few others that I'm aware of (Banesco USA, Investors eAccess, Rising Bank, UFB Direct, etc) that I can't really find anything about, the information I *can* find is inconsistent and contradictory, etc. 

Regardless, there are plenty of options out there--there's no reason to earn under 2% APY on a savings account.

Note that rates are subject to change, and there are other interest-bearing accounts--money market, checking, etc--as well as other financial instruments such as CDs out there. This is just meant to be a breakdown of basic savings accounts.",finance

personalfinance,15 year fixed-rate vs 30 year fixed-rate mortgages,"I'm still very far away from actually getting a mortgage due to having too many financial goals (getting out of debt, getting an emergency fund, saving up a substantial down payment). With that said, I'm still very curious about everyone's opinion on this topic.

&amp;#x200B;

I know that Dave Ramsey supports the 15 year fixed-rate idea, primarily because it means you'll be pushing the pedal to the metal more so when it comes to getting that asset paid off. Also it seems that most of the time a 15 year fixed-rate mortgage will typically have a lower interest rate.

&amp;#x200B;

If you went for a 30 year-fixed rate, however, your monthly mortgage is of course a good deal smaller, allowing for a more easily funded emergency fund, as well as more free money to have to allocate towards investments. Also technically this may allow for getting a better (more expensive) house overall.

Thanks in advance! Doing my own research, and finding 2.40% with First Savings Direct, but wanted to see if you guys know something I don't !

Edit: Thanks for all the feedback! Right now, I'm thinking that although there are some banks offering 2.50%, like Western State Bank, they don't have the solid track record like Ally of consistently increasing interest rates and automatically increasing them for existing customers. Some, will entice new customers with a very high APY and then drastically decrease it, without even telling you. A bait and switch. Some banks like Heritage offer 3.33%, but only up to 25k and you have to jump through hoops to get that rate. I'm a set it and forget it guy. I like simplicity. So I'm leaning toward Ally or Alliant. I'd make an extra $120 a year in interest with Western State, but who knows how long that interest rate will last or if it will ever increase.

personalfinance,Questions about how to handle my retirement accounts for a new Federal employee. Also concerned about protecting assets from disabling health conditions,"Hi Everybody,

I got hired on with the Department of Veteran's Affairs and started working April 1. I was teaching but saw that long term it's no longer a stable career. Hoping to make a long career at the VA or maybe transfer to another agency, but I'm hoping to do 20-22ish years with the Feds and retire.

I have SSDI because I'm disabled and my case was affirmed a Christmas. I will have to give that up in 10 months starting I think. April benefits are paid in May, so my coming check this month will be month 1. My SSDI checks after withholding to pay back and overpayment (We're still squabbling about that) are $1194 after a $301  withholding and I still owe about $4500. It had been $29,000, mysteriously went to $17,200 then when I won my new filing at Christmas they withheld back pay leaving me with 10,800…. I paid off $5000 in March on my credit card and paid the bill in full hat month from savings.  That all started when I reported my last teaching position, and they paid me for 6-8 months after I asked to stop payments. 6-8 months of benefits should be around $11,000 I’ve paid around $7000, plus the backpayments should have more than covered the 11,000 I initially owed. I’ve filed for a waiver, as well as a hearing with an administrative law judge.

I'm currently making $14.57/hr as a GS-4 used schedule A hiring authority to get the job. I have a graduate degree in Education and am eligible to transfer to a higher GS level job after 90 days so I'm hoping to move up quickly. Athough I have plans to move back home my long term plan with my girl didnt work out exactly as planned-we're still together but she got sick and that prevented her from moving with me, so I'm hoping to move back. We're not that far apart but the distance makes seeing either harder than we'd like.

I've got money stashed in multiple places and Im wondering if I can simplify, consolidate or do something better. 

I just got access to the Federal TSP plan, I had attempted to set my contribution to 5% the max the VA will match. There's also something called FERS (Federal Employee retirement system, I believe- but I havent investigated.) It's taking roughly 4% of my paycheck They mandate everybody pay 3% into TSP, I filled out paperwork at orientation to bump it to 5% but they lost the paperwork, so in light of needing to fill it out again I decided to bump my contribution to $500 a pay period and will leave it that way for 6-8 months while I have SSDI coming in and then go back to 5% of my salary around that 6-8 month mark so I've essentially put most of my SSDI check into TSP while I have it. That money is going into the L Fund (2045 retirement date, I’m 38 so that’s the year I turn 64. I believe I’m eligible to retire a 60 or 20 years whichever comes second and I’ll hit 20 years at 58.

I have a Florida Retirement System Investment plan account, fully vested, and worth $22,000.

My etrade accounts look like this: [Brokerage](https://i.imgur.com/I55Ddos.jpg) worth 125k

[Roth IRA](https://i.imgur.com/Ey2TTIb.jpg) just shy of 100k

I have a Bencor 401a plan with about $2,200 in it that I was going to roll into my TSP once I figure out what paperwork I need to complete to get that done. 

I have an Ally Savings account that has $37,000 in it. It's funded by an inheritance I got 4-5 years ago of 100k. I put over 40-50k into my etrade accounts in that time and spent some of it on living expenses when I was underemployed and trying to get SSDI. Don't really have a plan for that money but if all goes well with my lady I'd like to spend it on our future, either down payment on a house or maybe split it up some towards the house, some towards our ""we did the thing"" party, and  the honeymoon.

Is there any advantage to moving my Florida Retirement System into TSP or better to just leave it as is?

I’m also concerned about protecting my assets from health conditions, I have cerebral palsy and hydrocephalus. 

My girlfriend likely has Lupus SLE and joint hyper mobility. They haven't officially diagnosed her with Lupus, but they’ve ruled out all other possibilities and are treating her as if she has the condition they are just waiting for her test scores to get to he point they are 100% certain before making a formal diagnosis.",finance

personalfinance,Best way to refinance and possibly acquire rental property,"My wife and I are currently on our 2nd year of home ownership via a little-known mortgage program in Texas called ""SETH 5-Star."" It's got FHA bones and basically provided our closing costs and 3.5% down payment as grant money that we didn't have to repay, but with a minimum interest rate of 5% that we did get with our good credit. Overpayments are allowed, but the lender and the HUD-1 says that refinancing is not allowed. I posted about this before and everyone was equally confused as I was as to what was preventing Bank B from just writing a check to Bank A to take ownership of the note, and the best answer I got from a friend was that I'm unlikely to be able to refi with the same lender I have currently (US Bank), but could switch banks without issue. I can't check with the original lender as they are no longer in business and US Bank bought the note off of them secondhand, so I'm not even sure if \*they\* know that it can't be refi'd.

Anyway, if we CAN refi, is 3.25% (the current rate Navy Federal is offering) a good rate for fixed 30-year? Should we look into an ARM if we don't plan for this to be our forever home (my dad always said ARMs were like playing Russian roulette)? Are we likely to get 3.25% (we got the minimum 5% through SETH, and our credit scores our good, but we're young so our history/average age of accounts is lousy - same friend from above suggested none of that matters and lenders focus purely on debt-to-income ratio, of which ours is stupendous as we've nuked our student debt)?

If we DO refi, can we get out of the PMI if we can get below 80% LTV? I assume this depends on the appraisal?

Secondly, we're considering taking some of the equity out of our house to use a down payment for a conventional mortgage on a rental property. There's a few foreclosures in our area that are at really attractive prices that really just need minor fix-ups to rent for probably $300 more than the mortgage. Is this a smart move? This is also suggested by the same friend, as we do have the 20% down liquid in our savings, but that would be our whole life savings. I'd rather keep that money in our savings and instead parlay the equity from our current home into the down payment on a new one, unless this is massively stupid.

Many thanks for any advice!",finance
personalfinance,"College debt after dropping out, and credit is taking a blow","So I attended college for about 2.5 years and ended up dropping out. I have over $5k I owe to the school itself for tuition and then another few thousand (not sure the exact total) I owe for federal loans but have been making Navient payments whenever I can. I have only an idea of what I owe, all of this was done by my mother when I was a senior in high school. 

I tried getting the tuition paid for with the federal loan money last year, but everyone kept sending me in a phone circle with no clear answers (intentionally, I’m assuming?) and I ended up just ignoring it because I had literally no other options due to the fact that I had a whopping grand to my name and no one to help me.

I got a call from a debt collector a few weeks ago telling me I have to pay the $5k in tuition to my school by this month, I think it’s next week? I just got an email from credit karma saying my credit score dropped so that’s great.

Problem is, I don’t have the money right at this moment. I moved across the country last fall and just started working at a place that’s giving me ~30hrs/week $12/hr last week which is a huge weight off my shoulders (I was working before that, but on-call so hours were extremely unreliable). Asking family for help is not an option.

Is there a way I can set up payment plans? Is it too late? Do I take the blows to my credit and work on fixing it? I still have rent utilities and general living expenses to deal with, and I don’t want to be a financial burden on my boyfriend. Sorry if this is the wrong sub, I don’t have anyone in my life to talk to about this. 

Sorry I am just really clueless about this, obviously. I just want this nightmare to be over with so I can get on with my life. Any advice is beyond appreciated.",finance

personalfinance,"took mother as authorized user off credit, bank sent new card and she used it","long story short is, my mother racked up 10,000$ on my credit cards which i barely used (she was an authorized user), all while i was a full-time uni student and had barely any hours at work, and she would promise to pay back everything but that never came and will never (also her phone is under my name, I paid her phone and she would pay the monthly payments but of course not, so I'm stuck with that for a year) but thats a story for another time... 

I called the bank and told them to remove my mother as an authorized user and at the same time asked if it was possible to remove the cash back/rewards on the cards and lower the interest rate 20,99 to 10,99, I worked hard and paid off all my CC debt and with investment money I had kept long term but now back to scratch... months after when I was comfortable with how to handle a credit card, I called the bank and asked them to add back the rewards which brought the interest back up. Therefore, they would send new cards at my home and would just need to throw out the old ones. Once the new ones arrived, I noticed they sent extra ones under my mothers name, didn't bother and just left them in the envelop in my room. 

Now to backtrack, I haven't seen my mother since she left which is roughly a year now, but I know she keeps tabs with my sisters and probably when she came over to see my sisters, that's when she took the credit card under her name without me noticing... As of now she racked up 1,600$ in 6 days... I don't look my account everyday and didn't have any reasons too... but noticed when my statement came in... I am rambling but what can I do, do I have to again bare the consequences? 

Technically, the card gave her authorization but on the other I had canceled her card and removed her as an authorized user months ago with the bank... can the bank refund me what she racked up? this is driving nuts honestly, worked so hard to be debt free and now feels like it's for nothing... worked my score from 600 to 728 as of today... 

Please no judgement, only advice on what can be done... living in Canada, bank with BMO

personalfinance,Medical Bill sent to collections from treasury department.,"Hello, First time poster here. 

A little about me. I am a 28 yr old man from Texas under the Federal DACA program. No health insurance at time of accident. I just graduated from college May-2018. Just started living on my own this December. 

Backstory. On February 15, 2017 i was involved in a car accident while driving after visiting my SO. I was hit head on by a wrong way driver that supposedly was racing (that was never verified) who unfortunately passed at the scene. Due to the severity of my injuries (broken legs, ribs, an arm, and burns on 18% of my body) i was flown to a military hospital in San Antonio. I ended up being in the hospital for 2 weeks requiring multiple surgeries, and being in the burn unit for treatment. 

Now, i am looking for advise on what to do with my medical bills. I have taken the case to two different attorneys and they were not able to help me because the insurance the the other driver had had lapsed right at midnight. The accident happened a few minutes after. Since the driver was not on the policy he was considered an excluded driver. So the auto insurance company denied to pay. My expenses are as follow. 

Treasury Department/ Collections agency : about 180k

air ambulance: 65k

local ambulance : 1k

local hospital :17k

The state of Texas has agreed to pay about 50k as part of the states crime victims compensation. 10k for lost wages and about 40k would go towards any debt. 

Now, like i mentioned before hand, i just recently moved out of my house to start on my own. i have a job that pays me $15/hr (but i am still searching for a job in my field). The question is, is it feasible for me to make payment arrangements to start paying off this debt or should i consider bankruptcy? I am a DACA recipient and i would not want bankruptcy to affect my immigration status. Any advise is welcome and thank you very much for taking the time to read my post.",finance

investing,"Trump Threatened Tariffs After Hearing of Chinese Reversal, Sources Say","(Bloomberg) -- Donald Trump’s top trade negotiator told him that Beijing was back-tracking on a trade deal following a round of talks last week, angering the president and leading him to threaten on Sunday to raise tariffs on Chinese goods, according to people familiar with the matter.

In talks last week in Beijing, Chinese officials told their U.S. counterparts they would not agree to a trade deal that required changes to Chinese law, the people said. China had previously agreed to change its laws in the text of the deal, they said.

The change has major implications for provisions of the deal that would seek to end a Chinese practice of forcing U.S. companies seeking to do business in the country to reveal proprietary technologies and other intellectual property.

The U.S. side, led by Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, thought that issues around what’s known as forced technology transfer were resolved and considered the Chinese position on changing its laws to be an attempt to renegotiate, the people said. Lighthizer was angered by the move and briefed Trump.

The president then issued a pair of tweets on Sunday criticizing China and threatening to raise tariffs on about $200 billion in goods from 10 percent to 25 percent.

The people familiar with the matter asked not to be identified because the China trade talks are sensitive and have been conducted in secrecy. But official readouts last week from the U.S. and Chinese governments that depicted the latest round of talks in Beijing as productive were overstated, the people said.

The White House didn’t immediately comment.

A new round of trade talks are expected this week in Washington, but it is unclear whether the Chinese government will send top officials following Trump’s tweets. A Chinese foreign ministry spokesman said on Monday that a delegation would still travel to Washington but would not say when.

Global equities tumbled and Treasury futures climbed following the tweets, which damaged investor confidence the U.S. and China would soon resolve their trade war. The yuan slumped along with oil. The S&amp;P 500 Index fell nearly two percentage points on Monday before paring losses.

personalfinance,Removing accidental delinquent payments for Fedloan Servicing,"A little over a year ago, mostly of my own fault, my auto-pay information was not setup correctly for FedLoan Servicing, so when the 6 month grace period ended after college graduation,i was not making payments toward my federal loans when I thought I was. 3 months go by, and after not receiving any notice that anything bad would happen, I receive a credit alert from capital one saying I have delinquent payments, and my credit score instantly drops from low-mid 700's to about 575. I paid off the whole balance on the spot, and figure oh well, I'll get it back up again.

Today, I am trying to figure out how to refinance my student loans. Every application I send out, even with my mother as a cosigner gets rejected, and these delinquent payments I believe are part of the reason.

 I make 63k a year and live in a pretty low COL area of Ohio. My FICO score just made it back over 700. I don't have a problem paying bills, but I desperately need to refinance my crappy Sallie Mae 8.5% loans. I have 60k of student debt through them and it's not going down too quickly at this rate. I didn't have any problem paying these FedLoan bills either, but I just was not aware of the issue until it was too late. 

Is there anything I can do to get rid of these marks on my score? Or anything else I can do to get my loans refinanced as soon as possible?",finance
investing,Today's Startup Bubble Versus 1999 - The Information,"I recently saw a post here asking about today's IPOs versus 1999. This was published in The Information's Newsletter and lays out some of the key differences:



**Party Like It’s 1999**

If there has been one way to get laughed out of a room in Silicon Valley these past few years, it is to draw comparisons between the present day and the frothy late 90s.

Do so, and you are likely to get a lecture on all the reasons why the current tech “boom” in no way resembles the tech “bubble” that burst nearly two decades ago. For starters, today’s tech companies are global behemoths with orders of magnitude more revenue than flameouts like Pets.com. We aren’t seeing the same run-up in IPO prices that we did during the late 90s. Tech, media and telecom stocks represent about 32% of the S&amp;P vs. 45% in early 2000.

2019 is not 1999. But there is no doubt we are in a different bubble of sorts, and it’s time we recognized it. Because, while today’s tech companies don’t face the same risk of simply vanishing, they are burning through incredible amounts of cash, often with a story, but no evidence, about how they can reach profitability. The idea that SoftBank’s $100 billion Vision Fund, the one perpetuating these losses by funneling capital into money-losing companies before they go public, might itself go public without yet seeing stable returns on its investments is alarming.

Today’s newly public tech companies have a lot of runway because they have raised billions in the private markets and are raising big sums through their IPOs too. With interest rates now stabilizing, the market has bounced back; the party could continue for a little while.

But even so, we're in dangerous times. Any macro economic event could undermine confidence and bring everything tumbling down. And it’s hard to estimate how long companies’ cash will last when many are burning more year over year. Businesses are going to have to adjust their business models and cost structures dramatically, and some investors will suffer.

Uber spent $2 billion more in cash last year than it took in in revenue. Lyft burned through $980 million. Yet investors are valuing Lyft at seven times 2018 revenue. If Uber goes public around $81 billion, it will be valued at slightly more than seven times.

While those multiples aren’t crazy, they are risky for companies that are far more capital intensive than traditional tech companies.

That’s especially true of WeWork, which publicly announced its IPO preparations were well underway this week. The company last year lost more than it took in in total revenue—with a net loss of $1.9 billion on $1.8 billion in revenue. That is some serious money.

In some cases, the companies would like investors to believe that their losses can be erased quickly when they “decide” to become profitable and stop competing for market share. The only problem with that theory—which Uber, Lyft and their investors have been saying for the better part of a decade—is that the companies aren’t supporting it with any data. Many businesses remain races to the bottom with thin margins. Just ask the airline industry.

It’s not like growth is going gangbusters either. Uber’s ride-hailing business grew revenue 33% last year, down from 95% growth the year before. Revenues for Uber Eats, the supposed fast-growing second business for Uber, fell between quarters in 2018. Airbnb, which is expected to go public later this year or early next, has told investors that it conservatively expects to grow revenue 25% this year, down from 42% last year, Cory reported recently.

Even the profitable exceptions bear closer scrutiny. The team at Zoom has managed to grow what is a pretty basic video-conferencing feature to $330.5 million in revenue. But folks, it is still video conferencing, which is highly competitive and somewhat of a commodity. Its market cap is two-thirds the value of Twitter.

Perhaps some of these fears are already lowering expectations. Lyft is trading 13% below its IPO price. Remember when Uber was expected to go public at a valuation of $120 billion, according to what people close to the company leaked to the press? When the moment finally comes, expected at the end of next week, it is looking like it will be closer to $81 billion.

Indeed, it is starting to feel like this rush of IPOs is being fueled more by fear that the money is going to dry up than by the sense that they are strong enough to face the scrutiny of being public companies.

And that is never a good sign.",finance

personalfinance,Investing by starting a business,"Hey! I am joining the marines next year, (2020), and I also speak a few other languages, plus I am going into a high demand field with probably faster promotions. I'm going to be in for 7-8 years, then it's off to college. the reason I included that information is the Foreign Language Proficiency Pay, higher rank = high pay, and the timeline of my plans. I will be making money, but I don't really care about buying expensive cars or whatnot, I would prefer to save my money. My first thought was CDs (I saw that 'retirement accounts' in panama range from 7-9%, does anyone know how safe this is? I know high risk = higher profit, but, I read over it and it seems kinda legit), but my gf mentioned real estate and I looked into that I really liked what I saw. I did some calculations and I figured 150-200k (in my area) to buy a house, about 4 rooms, then I could spend a little, fix it up, make the basement into a little mancave/room, and then rent it out to college kids in the area, about 800 or so a month per room. I figured since I will be active military I could get a VA loan for a small business at a low interest rate, then pay that back with the profit/my own income. Then repeat the process once or twice. 

&amp;#x200B;

I figured I might make 10-15k a year, after taxes, management fees, etc, but idk, does that seem right? Also, I figured I could continue and turn this into a full on company. I thought of starting an LLC or an S-corporation first. I would own the company, and either a management company would take care of the property, or a friend of mine would for 10% profit. Anyone experienced in business taxes know which might be the better option in this case, tax-wise, for a company in this business with a small employee list?

personalfinance,Roth IRA over contribution question,"Hello all,

I have a question about over contributions to a ROTH IRA and I was hoping someone could help.

Per this site [https://cashmoneylife.com/what-if-you-contribute-too-much-to-a-roth-ira/](https://cashmoneylife.com/what-if-you-contribute-too-much-to-a-roth-ira/) if someone was to contribute over the current allotted limit to my IRA they are subject to a 6% extra tax.  

to make the math simple assuming a 2% return on an IRA if someone was to over contribute to their IRA and not withdraw the over contributions they would pay the 6%.  But assuming the 2% increase in 3 years wouldn't you break even and then gain more money starting after year 3?

&amp;#x200B;

The best way I can think of this is by this example:

contributed limit $6000 at a 2% interest rate and no further contributions.  

amount in account at the end of 1 years: $6120

amount in account at the end of 2 years: about $6242

amount in account at the end of 3 years: about $6367.  

amount in account at the end after 4 years: about $6494

profits about $494

&amp;#x200B;

contributed $7000  at a 2% interest rate and no further contributions.

tax penalty on the over contribution: $60 (I am not factoring this 60 in the amounts below because the way I understand it the 60 would be paid when tax returns are filed)

amount in account at the end of 1 year: $7140

amount in account at the end of 2 years: about $7282

amount in account at the end of 3 years: about $7427

amount in account at the end of 4 years: about $7575

profits about $575

&amp;#x200B;

difference in profits $81 minus the 60 penalty = $21

&amp;#x200B;

While I realize $21 is not a lot of money if this was done by $1000 or more every year wouldn't the end result offset the 6% penalty? or am I missing something?",finance

personalfinance,Should I refinance my auto loan,"I took out an auto loan last year for a car I purchased. The loan was sold to another company before I even made a payment on it. This new company (Illiana financial) is terrible. I was skeptical at first because it's a small local company that I've never heard of, but went with it anyways. I pay over the monthly amount and have automatic payments set up for every other week the day after i get my paycheck. Last week, I noticed the payment wasn't taken out. I tried to log on to my account (which I don't do often since I have automatic payments set up) and my password didn't work. I clicked the ""reset password"" button, and it said it would send a text verification to a phone number labeled ""work"" and the last two numbers that it shows me are not to any numbers that I have. Not to mention that I would never list my work number in the first place. I called and they weren't open yet (apparently they're only open 9-5 m-f) so I finally called back today. I go through this automated list that sends me to member services. It directs you to leave a message with your name and phone number and says they will get back to you in one business day. Here's the straw that broke the camels back ""are voicemail box is full at this time"" and then it hangs up.

I am beyond annoyed and also very concerned that someone has hacked my account and there is no way to get in touch with these people.

My credit score is pretty much the same as it was a year ago, though I am trying to buy a house in the next year or two so wondering if it makes sense to take another hit on my credit to refinance. I also have some money saved up and wouldn't mind putting a few thousand down if I were to refinance. Would that potentially get me a lower interest rate?

1) Can I self-sustain on the lower salary? 

2) Would you recommend a job for me? I’ve been mulling over these options for a while and it’s hard to choose

3) **How can I budget either of these salaries**?

personalfinance,"Regional bank vs national bank vs Ally for new checking, savings accounts?","Hello,

I am switching around my bank accounts due to some recent life changes, and I'd like to ping this subreddit's opinion about my plans. I plan to keep a checking account and a savings account, and I am shopping banks right now to see where it makes the most sense to open. 

Presently I have both accounts with a regional, midsize bank which I have been with for over 10 years. I also have a credit card through Chase, and plan to keep my credit card there.

For checking, I am trying to decide whether it is better to  stay with my current bank or to switch to a larger national bank (currently leaning towards BoA). The rates/limits/fees are similar between the two, so it really boils down to convenience and effects on credit rating and future credit availability. The pros for staying with my current bank (that I'm aware of) are (1) established history, (2) convenient branch locations (moreso than BoA at least), (3) familiarity with operations and tools, and (4) good experiences with customer service in the past. The pros for switching (that I'm aware of) are (1) better domestic ATM network, and (2) much better access to money overseas, which is good for my later plans for international travel. Presently, the international money access is reason enough for me to jump ship, but is there something I'm not thinking of? I haven't done any major lending through this bank, but I will be looking for a mortgage soon. Will changing banks in any way affect my credit rating?

For savings, I plan to switch to Ally just because of the interest rate and the online convenience. I haven't found any major reasons against this yet, but have I missed something? I am assuming that money will be easy and free to transfer between an Ally savings account and my non-Ally checking account, is this true?",finance

That said, now that I have access to this $60,000, I don't have much idea of what to do with it. Should I roll it straight into a target-based fund and remain with the back that manages it currently?

From what I've been able to gather, I can do an IRA with that. But I'm having a hard time choosing between traditional and Roth. I'm 35, which seems to suggest Roth, but I'm not earning income in the US, and would (I think?) have to transfer money from overseas in order to pay my tax burden rolling into a Roth? How can I know what that tax burden will look like? And is it still worth setting up the Roth when I'm not contributing?

personalfinance,Using someone else’s money to offset my home loan,"Context:
- I’m Australian.
- I have recently purchased a home. 
- I have made all of my bank accounts “offset accounts”.

Let’s say I have a home loan of $400,000
Currently making repayments at an interest rate of approximately 4.38%
The most competitive interest rate for a savings account in Australia at the moment is 2.8%

Let’s say a friend of mine transfers me $100,000 and I put (3%/12) into that account every month (Essentially acting as a savings account for them paying 3% interest) 

They are saving more money in interest because I’m giving them more money than what banks are offering whilst also increasing the size of the offset account decreasing the amount of interest coming out of my monthly repayments benefiting both of us. 
I am also paying 1.38% less to the bank in interest now and instead paying 3% on $100,000 to my friend. 

4.38% on $300,000 
3% on $100,000

Are there any issues (legal or tax) by doing this? (My friend depositing a large sum of money into my bank account)

I only see it as an issue of me having to pay an extra 3% in to my friends account on top of my regular repayments for now which will benefit  me greatly over a long period in time.

personalfinance,Last Hurdle on my Credit Card Debt,"Hi All,

Here's my personal situation:I have two credit cards I have been paying down in the past few months.

1. Credit Card A - Balance is $6000 interest rate is 17.15%
2. Credit Card B - Balance is $9500 interest rate is 18.00%

(from now on, I'll refer to 'Credit Card' as just 'CC', for brevity's sake)

CC B has recently approved a reduction in interest from 18% down to around 9%, with a minimum payment of 99$ per month for a term of 12 months. This will go back to the full terms (18% interest, payments based off of the balance of the account, etc.) after the 1 year period.

The other issue with CC B's account is that the account is closed, and only generating interest.

I can pay about 1,000$ per month on my CCs, at this moment (I have a family, and other obligations).

So, I'm wondering if I should **A.** attack CC B's credit, to get it paid within the term period (In about 10 months), and only pay minimum payments on CC A. OR, if I should  **B.** do the opposite, and pay down the card with the higher interest (really not liking this option, but it's here just so I can get it out there). OR,  **C.**  I was even thinking about taking out a personal loan for CC A, paying minimum on the loan, while I smash CC B into smithereens.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm really excited about the imminent future of, finally, getting rid of my cards, and never having to pay another cent of interest on these things....but just wondering if I can save a bit of time/money by optimizing the payoff method.

Job 2 has an annual salary of 33,000 dollars, which puts me in the 12% federal tax bracket. Not unionized. They give me less paid time off than at Job 1.

Between the Roths and my 403b, we put $21k/yr into retirement accounts. I have no brokerage accounts outside of that and I don't know if I should or not.

I wanted to get a second set of eyes on our strategy to help identify any strengths, weakness, opportunities and threats that might exist that are going unnoticed.

Since this (will apparently) change my payment plan, the lender said I needed to make one standard payment before they continue with processing my request.

I'm a full-time student transferring schools to LA in a couple of months. LA is massive, and I'm going to need a car before I move down. I need some guidance on getting a small loan with a manageable monthly payment at the lowest possible interest rate. As I'm shopping around online, I'm finding great used cars that fit my needs in the low $3000s. With that being said, I'm looking for a $3000 loan.

A brief profile on my finances: As a student, I also work full-time for about $19/hour. I've recently been developing my credit, and am currently in the low 700s.

My grandpa referred me to his credit union and I've been a member for about a year. I've been advised to apply for a loan through our credit union, but I am concerned that my given situation will deny me of the loan because my age of credit is not developed enough.

What are odds of getting approved for a small loan? Should I apply on my own or ask for a co-signer? Should I still look for loans outside of my credit union or is this the best way? (Also, does this fall under the category of an auto loan or a personal loan?)

I understand that these questions might be more appropriate to ask at my credit union (and I will ask them some time this week) but r/personalfinance has always been full of great posts and responses, so I figured it'd be just as helpful to ask here.

personalfinance,"Confused about my paycheck breakdown -- questions about withholding, IRA/401k, etc. Also, beneficiary IRA?","Hi,

I'm embarrassingly financially illiterate. I've now been working a couple years out of college and I know enough to save money/not spend beyond my means, have no debt, but I've been looking at making a more comprehensive budget lately, starting with knowing exactly where the money from my gross pay (twice a month paychecks) goes. I'm laying it all out partly to help myself understand, and also to ask a few questions.

So here's the breakdown of what I know:

|Gross pay:|3081.98|
:--|:--|
|EE Taxes: |-595.82|
|EE Benefits Pre-Tax Deductions:|-495.30|
|EE Benefits Post-Tax Deductions:|-308.20|
|Net Pay: |1682.66|
|Federal Taxable Wages: |2589.79|

No state income tax (hooray!).

Questions:

1) Even though 'gross pay' is identical every paycheck, 'EE Taxes' seems to vary ~$10-$20 every month. Is this just a thing that happens?

2) My 'EE Taxes' are about 19% of my gross pay. My total taxable wages comes out to $62155, which I think means I'm overpaying taxes. I know I get it back via tax return, but I would prefer to just pay the correct amount out of each paycheck and get less of a lump sum next April. I understand that to do that I would claim exemptions (synonymous with allowances?). However, there's a spooky ""under penalties of perjury I certify I am entitled to these withholding allowances"" checkbox -- how many am I entitled to claim? Since we're 5 months into the year and I've overpaid thus far... how do I do the math to figure out what to claim to come out to ~0? 

3) Splitting retirement contributions. I expect I'll have a similar income to now when I retire, so I've mostly been putting more into pre-tax. However, I noticed that my options for contributions are 'Pre-Tax', 'Roth', and 'After-Tax' - three separate categories. I looked it up and ""with a Roth 401(k), your money goes in after-tax"" - so why is there a separate election option for 'after-tax'? Right now I'm doing 16% to pre-tax, 10% to roth. (Just modified pre-tax to 14% since I did the math and I think I might hit the combined limit). According to [this article](https://www.guidestoneretirement.org/AboutUs/Articles/RothVsAfter-Tax) after-tax still taxes the earnings, but roth doesn't... but after-tax distributions are more liquid and you can take them out before you're 59.5, which makes them sound more like just an investment plan and not a retirement plan?

Inheritance questions:

I was the inheritor of a traditional IRA and a Roth IRA in 2017. The plan was to take the required yearly distributions and leave the money in those accounts using the stretch strategy as long as possible, but unfortunately during the paperwork/grieving/confusion we ended up checking off the five-year rule. I know, it's awful, I did the calculations and that money could've grown tax-free to *millions* if I'd taken life expectancy payments, but it's too late now -- I'm going to try and have it go towards a house so at least the lump sum will have gone to a good cause.

I'm now 2 years into that, which means all the money needs to be withdrawn in 3 years. Both have appreciated in value in that time. My understanding is that I will be able to withdraw from the Roth ($42k) with no tax implications, but I'll have to pay income taxes on the traditional one. The trad IRA has $35k in it. If my current taxable income is $62k ($50k with the $12k standard deduction), I can avoid hitting the next tax bracket ($82.5k) by withdrawing most this year and the rest next year. Would it make the most sense to do that &amp; then wait until the last moment to withdraw from the Roth? 

I'm not planning on doing anything with the money immediately, what's the best way to put it to use until 2022 (when I'll want to buy a house)? After taxes it'll be more like $27k, which is a lot (for me) to have sitting in my bank account, but not an amount I want to day trade with or anything.

Thanks! If you can answer one question or all of 'em, anything would help. I do plan on seeing a financial advisor closer to when the time comes to make the withdrawals, but the more information I have going in, the better.

I (bf) filed my taxes near deadline because I wanted the money to come as late as possible, in hopes to get it Closer to the birth of my 5th child. It is my 3rd child with my girlfriend of 8 years. When I filed, it said I was approved. I received my state return, but federal never came. I assumed it was because I filed at the end like a lot of people and it would take a little longer. We decided to max out our credit card, Airline card, by paying off some old bills that needed immediate attention, like a lawyer and old medical bills, Thinking we'd earn miles, Because we'd be getting $6700 coming any day to continue to pay the card off every month and earn miles. Finally find out that department of education sent me to deferment because one of my four navient loans went into default. They sent me letter, I obviously never read/saw it or I would have handled it. I’ve been paying $135 every month for a long time. I haven’t been in school since 2010 I believe, school Has since been shut down, not sure if that matters in paying back. Wright career college in Kansas where I’m from and live. I Called navient, they said to call department of education, so I call them and they say I haven’t been paying navient anything at all since at least April 2018,  which is incorrect. I have proof, so Navient has to fix the whole situation. Locally IRS hotline busy for that department when ever I call. No line to leave a number or wait inline to be next only a call back tomorrow recording. We are trying to stay positive, but We need that money for us to have any kind of maternity leave and to finish getting ready for a new baby. She runs her own cleaning business by herself and I currently get all my income from tips, unfortunately neither of us will have any kind of paid time off. We needed to know who can we call to get some of that money back? 
The interest rate for my education loans is 6+. My mobile home is 9+. Is it a bad idea to ask my grand father for a loan at 5% interest and consolidate? Good return all cash for him. I no longer give all my money to the banks. We've never needed to borrow money to pay bills which I've been proud of, we manage to sacrifice and get by. I can just work a whole bunch and get caught up, but I would Have zero family time, which is very important for us, it also would Not be fair to my almost 7 month pregnant gf to take care of my two daughters full time and our two kids we have all by herself.

Sadly That might happen again, as she is High risk, but still pushing herself to take care of our household enough. She Still has no one to help her with her clients clean. We just found out yesterday her insurance, Medicaid, removed her coverage and she has to reapply, which could take a month or more. She is very stressed and I just need an idea on how to help our family. Main thing is who can I call to help me get some return back. And loan from family good bad? I insist on no lower than 5%.

personalfinance,How much should I be saving for retirement?,"Stats:

Age: ~~27~~ 26

Savings: I have a few thousand saved up. I just started working in October after I graduated law school. 

Salary: $68k (will go up to $85k in July)

Debt: $265k in student loans (will likely qualify for PSLF in 10 years so I’m currently on an income based repayment plan. My monthly payments are $408/month, which will also go up a bit with my salary increase)

Current amount of salary being put into TSP (like a 401k): 3% (matched by employer)

I’m a federal civil servant and I’m anticipating working for the federal government for at least 25 years. I’m a lawyer so I’m guessing my top 3 salary range will be in the $150-$160k range (?) which (I believe) puts me at a retirement annuity of around $41,000. I will also likely be eligible for retiree health coverage.

So, what do I need to be saving? What puts me in the “safe” range? I currently live in a very high cost of living area, and although I have a roommate, my current expenses only allow me to save about $600/month (pre- pay raise).

Edit: I got my own age wrong 😬",finance
personalfinance,Consolidating My Student Loans vs. Keeping Them Separated,"Hi All, I’m looking for some opinions about this, as I’m really unsure what the best course of action is. I graduated from college 3 years ago and I have 4 direct unsubsidized stafford loans, each with a different fixed interest rate. I pay them thru FedLoan, and every month they give me a lump sum payment suggestion which is divided across all of the loans. I usually pay $100 more than the suggestion just to keep interest down. However, one of the loans is going up instead of getting paid down. It has the highest interest rate at 6.8%. Basically, I’m unsure if I should keep the loans separate and try and refinance each of them to see if I can get better interest rates, or consolidate them into one big loan, see what the interest rate is, and then refinance from there if I think I could get it lower. I’m mainly just looking to see some opinions on the matter. I’m a 1st gen college grad and my parents aren’t the best help on this front. Thanks in advance!!",finance
personalfinance,Should I accept charity money from my boss?,"If this isn't the right sub, please remove!

My boss/owner of the business is very supportive of our small team in general but does not pay us very much wages or provide any insurance for us.

The first time I was offered a ""gift"" for car repairs I turned it down and felt pretty weird about the whole thing, since in my mind I would rather be paid a higher wage and take care of my own problems.

What do you think is the right way to deal with this offer given the circumstances?

Background info:

Wife and I currently gross a little over 150K / year not including small bonuses here and there. We've paid down a ton of debt over the past two years (40K in medical, 40K in CCs) and bought a house recently. We have 20K liquid cash with ZERO saved for retirement. We have three kids so expenses add up quickly, but we are pretty conscious with our spending.

The only debt remaining is a 68K HELOC. The rate on the HELOC is 3.29% until March 2020 and then 5.29% variable after that. My question is: Do we buckle down hard and pay down the HELOC ASAP while the interest rate is low or do we stretch the HELOC out for a few years and ride the stock market roller coaster in attempt to grow some cash? Or do we settle for a plan in the middle somewhere i.e. begin funding IRAs and throw the rest at the HELOC??

\*\*Obviously, the stock market has been pretty volatile as of yet and I imagine that will not end any time soon rolling into the 2020 election year, but it also seems like I could be throwing money away by dumping it all into the HELOC...

personalfinance,Transferring my credit card debt to a new credit card?,"Hello!

I had a question about credit cards. I got an offer in the mail from Citi Bank and it states I can transfer my credit card balances and pay 0% interest for 21 months. 

I currently have a capital one card that has about $800 of debt and a Chase Freedom that has about $250 of debt. Both of these cards have a high interest rate of about 18% 

My question is would it be wise to open the new Citi Bank credit card and transfer the balances to it and pay 0% interest for 21 months? I have a feeling that it would be smart to do but I dont know the ins and outs of credit cards. Should I cancel either the capital one or chase? Cancel both? Keep all three? 

I'm working hard on my credit score and I dont want to mess anything up. I'm currently sitting at a 765.

&gt;  
&gt;Final average salary is generally the average of the highest three consecutive years (or less if you were employed for less than three years) or 1/3 of total salary in the last 36 months of employment.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Formula:** 1.5 percent x years of retirement credit x final average salary

personalfinance,Odd question about investing in 401k,"So I am far from a real expert, but amongst my circle I am the personalfinance guy. One of my friends had a question that I had no idea about so I figured I'd turn here. 

He is married, father of 2, and they live off his income alone which is modest. Due to their situation he says for the last several years he has not paid any federal taxes (his withholdings are high enough on his w4 so that no federal taxes are taken from his paychecks and he still gets a refund at the end of the year). The way I understand it, one of the big advantages to a work 401k is using pre-tax dollars, but since he pays no federal taxes is that really the best way to go here? Would it be better for him to just put in enough 401k to get his employer match and then max out his Roth to get the tax savings on the back end?",finance

Let’s say I want to build a $200,000 house. I would get a loan for $250,000 and use $50,000 of it as the down payment.

investing,Question on Bond ETF's and Treasuries,"So I've been reading a lot of conflicting information on Bond ETF's. Some people say BND is great to have, other's say it's performance is really not that good.

Im looking to add some VERY safe Bond's to my portfolio. I know interest rates are rising (Although housing interest rates are pretty low right now) so i've heard bonds are sort of taking a dive and will probably continue to so I should only bother investing in short term bond.

Ideally im looking for quality bonds, most likely treasuries to protect myself in case of a recession (Which I feel we are going to hit at some point). Which people say it's better to get treasuries long term?

So im a bit confused at all this. Should I just go with BND or maybe mix and match some of the Short/Intermediate/Long term treasuries?

(Also I know Treasuries go up with a bear market, but is the same true for corporate bonds). I would go Municipal bonds but none are really available in my state (at least that m1 finance can see). This is for a taxable account FWIW but I also have the same question for my Roth IRA.

Latest email:


Procurement Manager Start Process 

Thank you for the interest in the Procurement Manager Position. During the probationary period of 3 weeks, you will be given simple orders in the beginning. Your duties will be to procure the required items, package and mail them out to the client. To perform these duties, your responsibilities will be: find the items, negotiate the prices and discounts during purchasing, determine who is the best vendor/supplier, finish shipping to the client, and complete all the required reports. When you find the required items, you will purchase them using the Company's money. You will receive the monies prior to your purchase. During your probationary period, the Company will show you how to work in accordance with our high business standards. During the period, we will get an understanding of your work capacity and the volume of assignments you can manage.


By the end of the probationary period we will determine:

The amount of time it takes you to complete an assignment.

How accurately you complete each assignment.

How many assignments you can do in a month.

Your management skills.

Your ability to cope with challenges during the assignments.




Our probation period objectives:

Provide the new Employee with the latest guidelines, directives, tasks etc.

Provide the new Employee with an overview of the ordering, purchasing, shipping process.

Provide the new Employee with knowledge required during the purchasing and shipping process.

Provide the new Employee with an overview of the required financial operations including work transactions, cash flow, wage payments, commission rates, the reimbursement process, and preparation of the required financial statements.




The main goal of the probationary period is to determine the amount of assignments and then create your own personal Work Plan. After your probation period ends, we will supply a Company’s credit card to you. Your personal credit line with the company will be calculated after your first working month and will depend on the total amount of the orders completed by the end of the 1st month. Therefore, it is in your best interest to work hard during the 1st month. The Company is responsible for establishing the Employee’s credit limit.

Money Transfer Details 


The Company will provide you with a corporate credit card after three to four weeks from your start date and after completion of the probation period and the eight assignments minimum. During the initial three week probation period, you must be able to receive the Company's money to your personal credit card account in order to fulfill the different kinds of assignments. After you complete the probationary period, we will provide you with a 1099 tax form and all the Company’s transfers will be excluded from your personal income. You will have to use your credit card to receive the company’s money because only credit cards allow money transfers without requiring banking information from you. This method was chosen by the Company for its own safety. If there is an incomplete fulfillment of the Employee's obligations, e.g. a peculation case, the refund of transferred amount will be provided with a long inquiry and police investigation. If the company makes a money transfer to your credit card within your credit card limit, our Bank will insure all the expenses and risks for money. It will save our time and the monies. The company does not need your credit card number, credit account number or other details for you to receive the money transferred to your credit card. Because of this procedure, you will have to manage each transaction on your own. The joint bank account based in our corporate account with you as an authorized account holder will allow access to the money. Before each credit card transaction, our Financial Department will approve an exact amount of payment. As soon as the amount is approved, you can pay off the balance of your credit card account. We will forward your personal joint account number and the routing number of the Company's bank account and detailed instructions how to withdraw money from our bank account to pay off your card. Different Credit Card Companies have different credit card bill payment methods but they all work the same way. This is the basic process. You log on to your credit card account online; in the menu for your credit card bill payment, add our company account number and routing number as a ""Pay from"" account. Using this account, you will pay your balance on the prior approved amount. Next, you will inform us about the payment and our financial department will confirm that transaction with our bank. If you do not have online access to your credit card account, you can make these transactions through the automated phone teller service or with a call directly to your bank.

For security reasons and to avoid unauthorized transactions, our Company has performed a credit background check. You agreed to a background check when you agreed with the terms described in our previous letter entitled “Job Description”.  We have to be sure that the Company's money can only go to your credit card. It's impossible to transfer it to another person credit card account. Therefore, for all this process to work, the name of the joint bank account based in our corporate account must be the same as that on your credit card.

Based on your Background Report you can receive the Company's money to these credit cards:

CHASE CARD - VISA CARD
Credit limit: XXXX
Recent balance:XXXX

CHASE CARD - VISA CARD
Credit limit:XXXX
Recent balance: XXXX

The process will work as follows: the Company will pay off your current credit card balance; then when you receive the available credit, you will purchase the required items (using only the amount we have paid) and charge your card again. You will then ship purchased items. The Company will then pay off your credit card balance again. In this case we ask you to ship out required items immediately within one working day, because you have already got the money before the purchase. All the conditions are discussed individually and can be amended with the agreement of the parties.

Shipping Details 


When you purchase the items, the Company will provide you with prepaid shipping papers. The shipping papers will be sent to your email and you will use them to ship the items. The shipping papers will be pre-paid, already completed and they will always have insurance. The Company has corporate accounts with different shipping services like USPS, DHL, FedEx, UPS and we always pre-pay for the goods shipping. The Company always takes responsibility for customs duties and taxes. The shipping details for the sender will be the Company's name and office address, but if you prefer, they can filled out in your name. You will be responsible to prepare the items for shipping. Money will be provided for you to buy packaging materials (boxes, bubbles, adhesive / shipping tape, wrapping material and any other materials). Shipping labels will be sent to your email address. You will need a printer (you will need access to a printer) to print the labels. You should not change the labels, do not add additional details or change information on the labels. They are filled out by the Company’s shipping department and are always correct. You should follow the Supervisor’s exact instructions for timely shipping and correct packaging. Please note, you are responsible for shipping the items out in time!

Salary and Commission Reimbursement 


You will receive a salary of $8,200.00 monthly as well as commissions within one week after the probationary period. You will be reimbursed by check or by a direct banking transfer to your bank account. There may be an option to receive your commission after every fulfilled assignment.
Here are the payment conditions for your commission: the Company will pay the commission fee based on the cost of every purchased item. The basic commission is 10% of the purchased price. You can make your commission higher during the probationary period and later, if you continue using your credit card for item purchases. You will receive an additional 5% commission if the sum of each transaction charged to your credit card is 85% or more of your card credit limit or if the total amount of purchases for an assignment is more than $25,000.00. In these cases, your commission fees will be 15% of the amount paid for each purchased item. The additional commission will be possible, if you complete any of these following conditions:

When you begin work, your credit card balance must be more than 85% of the credit limit of this card. For example, if your credit card limit is equal to $15,000.00 you must have a balance of $12,750.00 or more. If your balance doesn't meet this condition, you should bring your balance up to $12,750.00 beforehand by purchasing your own necessities, or withdraw it in cash, or make a balance transfer from another credit account.

worldpolitics,Gaza Youth Breaks Out's manifesto,"[https://fr-fr.facebook.com/pg/GazaYBO/about/?ref=page\_internal](https://fr-fr.facebook.com/pg/GazaYBO/about/?ref=page_internal) 

&amp;#x200B;

Fuck Israel. Fuck Hammas. Fuck Fatah. Fuck UN. Fuck UNWRA. Fuck USA! We, the youth in Gaza, are so fed up with Israel, Hamas, the occupation, the violations of human rights and the indifference of the international community! We want to scream and break this wall of silence, injustice and indifference like the Israeli F16’s breaking the wall of sound; scream with all the power in our souls in order to release this immense frustration that consumes us because of this fucking situation we live in; we are like lice between two nails living a nightmare inside a nightmare, no room for hope, no space for freedom. We are sick of being caught in this political struggle; sick of coal dark nights with airplanes circling above our homes; sick of innocent farmers getting shot in the buffer zone because they are taking care of their lands; sick of bearded guys walking around with their guns abusing their power, beating up or incarcerating young people demonstrating for what they believe in; sick of the wall of shame that separates us from the rest of our country and keeps us imprisoned in a stamp-sized piece of land; sick of being portrayed as terrorists, homemade fanatics with explosives in our pockets and evil in our eyes; sick of the indifference we meet from the international community, the so-called experts in expressing concerns and drafting resolutions but cowards in enforcing anything they agree on; we are sick and tired of living a shitty life, being kept in jail by Israel, beaten up by Hamas and completely ignored by the rest of the world.  


There is a revolution growing inside of us, an immense dissatisfaction and frustration that will destroy us unless we find a way of canalizing this energy into something that can challenge the status quo and give us some kind of hope. The final drop that made our hearts tremble with frustration and hopelessness happened 30rd November, when Hamas’ officers came to Sharek Youth Forum, a leading youth organization ([**www.sharek.ps**](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sharek.ps%2F&amp;h=AT31EFEq2RTIoZJ58TJC4U1VCiLyUYUkj5OhI_rnI7Gyi0I0WD0a9r73mvFzIvaQCccfOLOF9c0kYrxXGa1HJQYM_R49RyMcMWc-3NN4-93iWHjRaRXjy8pzPPi7FCHZttDh-Wp203cOEbF7BJp9GPQ-)) with their guns, lies and aggressiveness, throwing everybody outside, incarcerating some and prohibiting Sharek from working. A few days later, demonstrators in front of Sharek were beaten and some incarcerated. We are really living a nightmare inside a nightmare. It is difficult to find words for the pressure we are under. We barely survived the Operation Cast Lead, where Israel very effectively bombed the shit out of us, destroying thousands of homes and even more lives and dreams. They did not get rid of Hamas, as they intended, but they sure scared us forever and distributed post traumatic stress syndrome to everybody, as there was nowhere to run.  


We are youth with heavy hearts. We carry in ourselves a heaviness so immense that it makes it difficult to us to enjoy the sunset. How to enjoy it when dark clouds paint the horizon and bleak memories run past our eyes every time we close them? We smile in order to hide the pain. We laugh in order to forget the war. We hope in order not to commit suicide here and now. During the war we got the unmistakable feeling that Israel wanted to erase us from the face of the earth. During the last years Hamas has been doing all they can to control our thoughts, behaviour and aspirations. We are a generation of young people used to face missiles, carrying what seems to be a impossible mission of living a normal and healthy life, and only barely tolerated by a massive organization that has spread in our society as a malicious cancer disease, causing mayhem and effectively killing all living cells, thoughts and dreams on its way as well as paralyzing people with its terror regime. Not to mention the prison we live in, a prison sustained by a so-called democratic country.  


History is repeating itself in its most cruel way and nobody seems to care. We are scared. Here in Gaza we are scared of being incarcerated, interrogated, hit, tortured, bombed, killed. We are afraid of living, because every single step we take has to be considered and well-thought, there are limitations everywhere, we cannot move as we want, say what we want, do what we want, sometimes we even cant think what we want because the occupation has occupied our brains and hearts so terrible that it hurts and it makes us want to shed endless tears of frustration and rage!  


We do not want to hate, we do not want to feel all of this feelings, we do not want to be victims anymore. ENOUGH! Enough pain, enough tears, enough suffering, enough control, limitations, unjust justifications, terror, torture, excuses, bombings, sleepless nights, dead civilians, black memories, bleak future, heart aching present, disturbed politics, fanatic politicians, religious bullshit, enough incarceration! WE SAY STOP! This is not the future we want!  


We want three things. We want to be free. We want to be able to live a normal life. We want peace. Is that too much to ask? We are a peace movement consistent of young people in Gaza and supporters elsewhere that will not rest until the truth about Gaza is known by everybody in this whole world and in such a degree that no more silent consent or loud indifference will be accepted.  


This is the Gazan youth’s manifesto for change! We will start by destroying the occupation that surrounds ourselves, we will break free from this mental incarceration and regain our dignity and self respect. We will carry our heads high even though we will face resistance. We will work day and night in order to change these miserable conditions we are living under. We will build dreams where we meet walls.  


We only hope that you – yes, you reading this statement right now! – can support us. In order to find out how, please write on our wall or contact us directly: [freegazayouth@hotmail.com](mailto:freegazayouth@hotmail.com).

personalfinance,Convincing Verizon Phone Scam,"Just another warning here to be careful with phone calls and scams.

I just got a spoofed call from one of Verizon's 1-888 phone #s that showed up in my caller ID as Verizon.

They had a pretty realistic voice prompt system and indicated that your account was frozen and you could speak to a  representative to unfreeze it if need be.  Just like when you actually call Verizon, it asked for your PIN, but then also asked for the last 4 of your social security number.  It then put you ""on hold"" for a minute before saying that all representatives were busy and they would call you back.

It's a scam that I feel that a lot of people could actually fall for and enter in the information before they realize what they have done.

Never enter that information in on a call you you receive, only when you call their actual number listed on their website or your bill.",finance

personalfinance,"Pay off loan in my name, or other loan.","Hello there personal finance, this account is a throwaway because I got paranoid before I was about to post. I have a question about what I should do with my money. I have pretty much just let it set there not doing anything even though I have loans to pay off. I live in California with my wife and our child. I am a personal finance NOOB, and I need help figuring out what to do.

&amp;#x200B;

Here is the financial situation:

Total Income per month (after taxes):

Bi-monthly: $1169 (4% went to 401k, and 280 goes to HSA)

Monthly bonus: Ranges from $3000-$6000

Total Income per month (does not get taxed, but I pay at the end of the year):

Monthly: Ranges from $900-$1500

The wife does not work right now, as that is best for our son.

&amp;#x200B;

Total net worth I have:

Bank Account: $11216

Savings: $44

Separate Account: $22683

Cash: $5500

HSA Account: $2166 (.05%APY interest)

401k: $31849 (vested balance $26575; maybe someone can explain what this means; I think it is my money, the total is with the employer match?)

2 reliable vehicles that are completely payed off.

&amp;#x200B;

Total Monthly necessities: \~$4300 (rent, food, insurance, etc)

&amp;#x200B;

The debt that I currently have is:

Hospital bills: Will reach my out of pocket max of 8500 for sure. $4,000 deductible has already been met

Student Loan: $25022 (4.25%) Currently paying $200.00 per month (20 year loan I think?)

Parent Plus Student Loan (in my moms name): $37125 (7.00%) Currently paying $300.00 per month (this is more than the minimum payment, I think it was a 20year loan)

&amp;#x200B;

I assume the best thing to do is to pay off my student loans and of course the one with the most interest first. However, the main thing to consider is that the Parent Plus Student Loan does not show up on my credit report. Only the Student loan shows up. So which one should I pay off first? To me it makes more sense to pay off the loan that is in my name so that it does not show up on my credit report anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

I do also have the possibility of having my father-in-law loan me some money in order to pay off one of the loans, and then I would pay him back at a lower interest rate (1-2%). He has some money sitting around and he may be willing to help me out in this aspect.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: If it means anything, I am 25m married with 1 child. 

Last year we were not married, and I claimed HOH and received about 1500 back in taxes. I was paying the whole year claiming 0 dependents",finance

personalfinance,"I'm receiving a life insurance payout and a Vanguard 401(k), and need some advice.","**About me:**

`33, not married`

`Checking: $10,000`

`Savings: $30,000`

`HRA: $20,000`

`Income: $90,000 with a yearly COLA and performance increase`

`Retirement: Pension + invested account that my employer puts 6% of my salary`

&amp;#x200B;

**The pension is calculated as follows:**

&gt;It is designed to provide approximately 45 percent of your final average salary at retirement (for a general service member with a 30-year career or a police and firefighter member with a 25-year career).  
&gt;  
&gt;Final average salary is generally the average of the highest three consecutive years (or less if you were employed for less than three years) or 1/3 of total salary in the last 36 months of employment.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Formula:** 1.5 percent x years of retirement credit x final average salary

&amp;#x200B;

I cannot contribute to the other invested account that my employer puts 6% into, it's part of the pension basically.

&amp;#x200B;

**Debt:**

`Student Loans - $15,000 @ average 5% interest rate - down from $60,000`

`Mortgage #1 - $253,000 @ 3.875% - My house`

`Mortgage #2 - $83,000 @ 4.25% - Out of state duplex rental`

&amp;#x200B;

**Receiving:**

`Life Insurance Payout: $303,000`

`Vanguard 401(k): $175,000`

&amp;#x200B;

\--------------------

&amp;#x200B;

**Questions:**

1. I'm rolling the 401(k) into an Inherited IRA with Vanguard, and will take the yearly RMD. What funds would you suggest I invest in for this account?
2. What should I do with the life insurance payout? In the short term, I plan on moving it into my Discover savings account, but when should I just use it to max our an IRA each year? What would you suggest?

personalfinance,Financial Advice and Buying a Used Car (23 y/o starting an MD-PhD program),"((I hope this post is okay, fwiw I have read through the wiki and the [auto wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3898f1/step_by_step_guide_on_how_to_buy_a_car_my_friend/), which was super helpful)) 

A little background: 

I am about to graduate college, and will spend the next 8 years doing an MD-PhD program in which I will be making about $32,000 a year via stipend (before taxes), with an estimated $3400 yearly tax on this stipend (according to current students). My monthly expenses will be fairly low, as I am going to live in subsidized grad housing and I don't often eat out/go out.

I have about 150k in student loans from undergrad. My mother has been supportive throughout college when she can, but I did have to pay for all of my education myself (single mom, multiple siblings, you know the deal). Applying to medical school is a crazy expensive process. The applications themselves ran about $4500, and then I had to fly/travel to 7 different cities across the country for interviews and sometimes pay for lodging (another around $3.5k ). This went on credit cards. My mom did help me pay off some of it, but I still have around $5k of cc debt that I am steadily paying off. I got into a pretty bad interest situation, and did a few balance transfers to new credit cards to save myself from getting overwhelmed by interest. In hindsight, this might have been a bad choice as my credit score was lowered, I'm not sure..

As a result, my credit score is very meh (\~650 TransUnion), with my FICO score currently reading 630, which makes me worried I'm going to get stuck with a horrible interest rate when trying to get an auto loan. I've never missed a payment and I have been proactive in paying off my debt, but I can't really fix what applying to medical school did to my finances. 

&amp;#x200B;

I went to college in a large compact city where I didn't need to have a car. I am about to move across the country to a more sprawling area for med school, and will thus need to purchase a car. I currently have been working around 40 hours a week between two jobs while in my last year school to try to cut down on my credit card debt and save for a down payment on car. 

The max I am hoping to spend on a used car is $10k, I would ideally like a monthly car payment of $225 or lower, which would be less than 10% of my monthly income. I am now trying to figure out the financing aspect. Given my low credit score, am I screwed? Are there lenders I should be looking at for my situation, is there a way I can be like ""I'm going to medical school I promise I'm not a deadbeat""? My mother cannot co-sign my auto-loan, as she already co-signed for my student loans and my sister's student loans.  I'm going to start with my bank (I have an appointment next week) and see what they say and go from there, but I figured I should ask the great people of reddit for help/advice. 

&amp;#x200B;

General advice about smart next financial moves (paying off my student loans, of course..) while I'm in med/grad school would also be appreciated.

personalfinance,Help! A commuter's dilemma,"I have a dilemma that I wanted advice on:

I (18M) got a job at a local amusement park working retail full time for the summer, 13 miles away. When I looked at the busses, It's a 2 hour commute up and 2 hours down (roughly) with 45 minutes of walking each way. It's a crummy commute so I was looking at other modes of transport and came across two problems: my current bike is not a good commuting option, and I can not immediately come up with cash for a new mode of assisted transport (be that a car, moped, or e bike). 

I was hoping to bike because with an electric assist bike, I could cut my commute down to between an hour and an hour and a half and get some light exercise while at it. Plus, I don't have to worry about fuel, insurance, and high price repairs of beat up cars or mopeds. I even checked strava and found a medium-use route between here and the theme park.

But like I said, I can't come up with the $1000-$2000 for an electric bike RIGHT NOW. And by the time I save that up, the job will almost be up and it'll feel pointless because I spent at least a month and a half making the bus commute (yes, i still plan on using a bike in college).

What do you recommend? I was considering a personal loan (same requirements and interest rate as a credit card) but my mom doesn't like the idea. Do you see any alternatives I've overlooked? Am I just SOL and should eat the bus ride? I'm hoping you had some advice for me since this sub is far better at finances than I.",finance

personalfinance,Redeem &amp; Reinvest or Hold - Short Duration Debt Fund,"Hi. I'm a 25 year old guy from India. I make reasonably enough money from my salary. I save \~24% of it in fixed income (bank term deposits). Last year I decided to split this in two as the bank interest rates are not great. So I invested into a Short Duration Debt Fund as an SIP (Systematic Investment Plan). They have returned 40\~50% above bank deposit rates for the past year.  My question is, should I redeem them and take profits or hold them long term. Considering this is a short duration fund, will it lead to reduced returns if I hold them too long. I am required to hold my units only for a year, so if I redeem them now, there won't be any exit load.  
I typically go for 1 year deposits (since the rates reduce if the period is any longer) and reinvest the sum(principal+interest gained) from the next year again. If I were to redeem my Fund units, I would be reinvesting them as well in an SIP.

personalfinance,Refinancing my car. I have some questions.,"I had posted on here before about my piss poor judgment call when buying my vehicle. 

Long story short I no longer have the cushy job I had when I bought it. I moved, got married, and my wife and I are both disabled veterans. So with that income and my part time job I have enough to make the payments and never made a late one. I’ve raised my credit score quite a bit and knocked down some credit card debt. Also I took care of something in collection. With both of our disability and my part time job it still pales in comparison to what I made with my previous employment. 

We want to refinance the car, so here are some questions I have and hopefully someone can clear things up for me. 

Would it be best for her to co-sign on the refinancing? For clarification she has just as good of credit score as mine, which both are now considerably better than my time of purchase.

I am in the process to get my old job back or one equivalent in pay. Should we wait until I have that income to prove to the bank that I make X amount of money? I’m not quite sure what is looked at when refinancing. How big of difference it would make if I refinanced now or waited? 

What’s the ballpark range, that one could consider reasonable or good as far as their reduction in interest rate goes? 

Thanks in advance for any help.",finance

personalfinance,30Yr Mortgage w/ PMI - How can I remove PMI? Help,"Before everyone tells me I have to pay at least 20% towards the principal, this is a bit more complicated. Here are the facts:

* 30 Year Conventional Loan
* I paid 3.5% down
* I had the PMI rolled into the mortgage payment by increasing the interest rate

&amp;#x200B;

Long story short, I didn't pay 20% down because I bought the house ""As Is"" and I wanted to spend my money remodeling the place. When I found out I had to pay PMI (Private Mortgage Insurance) I was given 2 options: (1) Pay it separately or (2) Roll it into my mortgage payments.

&amp;#x200B;

Option (2) seemed like the best money saving deal so naturally I chose to roll the PMI into my mortgage. Fast Forward 2 years, and I've spent well over 50k on my house, which really increased my home value.

&amp;#x200B;

The problem is, even though my house is worth over $480k and I only have $320k left in principal, I have to still pay PMI even though this is well over the 20% mark.  The only way to remove is by refinancing which I don't want to do because of the higher interest rates or to pay the additional % of money towards my original loan to meet the 20% minimum.

&amp;#x200B;

(Is this making sense so far?) - I chose to put the money towards my house increasing the value and therefore I shouldn't have to pay PMI anymore but I am stuck. Any help would be great! Thank you.",finance

stocks,Stability Breeds Instability,"So the larger / existential question: why does this now almost quarterly “short vol / easy-carry / easy-carry / easy-carry BLOW-UP then v-shaped snapback” seemingly occur now more-than-ever before?

“Stability breeding instability” – you can pin-this on the post GFC Central Bank policy response of large-scale-asset-purchases and forward-guidance on “lower interest rates and flatter curves forever” which has then perpetually suppressed cross-asset volatility AS WELL AS squelched yields—all in order to create intentional “financial repression” which drives “portfolio rebalancing” / “reach for yield” via “pushing-out on the risk-curve” behavior.

Real Money institutions have moved from being BUYERS of volatility and tail-risk hedges to instead turn VOL SELLERS in the post-crisis period (systematic call overwriting / put underwriting, condor- and strangle- selling, roll-down etc)—all in order to generate total return / “yield enhancement” in a world deprived of return.

personalfinance,Buy Pricier House Now or Later?,"My wife and I (no kids yet) are currently on the house hunt and have a pretty good idea of what we want, what we can afford, etc.  We've discussed over the past several years how much house we want to buy and how long we want to be there.  Ideally, we plan to have 2-3 kids and would like to buy a house to live in for the next 20-30 years before downsizing at retirement.  We're moving to a new community that isn't far away from us but we're also not that familiar with.  Houses we have been looking at are generally $325-400k with most on the higher end of that range, so for the sake of the argument below I'm going to assume a $380k purchase price.

&amp;#x200B;

We just found a house that we like listed at $280k.  The problem is that it isn't ultimately what we want, but would work well for us for \~5-10 years until we have kids in school and advance further in our careers.  It is a ranch style that is smaller than we'd like to have with several kids and lacks some ""luxury"" features we would like, but the lower price is appealing.  We've considered similar houses in the past and felt that they either lacked too much or were priced too close to our ""dream house"" prices.  This one is a pretty happy medium.

&amp;#x200B;

The cheaper house will save us \~$550/mo in mortgage/taxes/upkeep/insurance for a total of \~$66k over 10 years.  Subtract out the costs of selling and moving at that time and the savings are closer to $50k.

&amp;#x200B;

If in 10 years we buy the nicer house we want, I made the assumptions that housing prices may not change but interest rates will likely go up to a more historical average of 6.25%.  The $380k house will cost us an additional $375/month in interest for a total of $136k over 30 years.  Of course these are assumptions and the housing market may be very different than it is today, but those are the assumptions I am comfortable making.

&amp;#x200B;

So what do you in PF think?  Should we take advantage of the lower rates (but maybe higher purchase prices) and buy our dream house now, or should we settle for the cheaper house and plan to upgrade when rates are higher (but maybe lower purchase prices)?  Are the savings now worth more than the (potential) costs later?

&amp;#x200B;

Slightly off topic, but this house may cater better to a family with small children than our ""dream house"" and will also allow us to have a better idea of how large of a family we will have before we jump into a 5 bed, 3000 sq ft house.  It also allows us to get a better feel for the community before settling down long-term.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Save $50k over the next 10 years by settling for a smaller house and upgrade when rates may be higher, or buy big now to lock in lower rates for long-term.",finance

personalfinance,Need some advice... am I crazy to be thinking about buying a house in the semi-near future?,"Hi all, I've been a long time lurker here and read some great advice posted on this subreddit in the past.  I feel like I really need a sanity/reality check on my current financial situation and thoughts for the semi-near future (defined as 1-2 years).

I've had and will have some major life milestones this year.  I just recently started a new job, which pays 50% more than my previous job and puts me just into 6-figure territory.  I'm also getting married at the end of the year, and my fiance and I have saved up enough for a reasonably frugal wedding and honeymoon (total ~$10,000).  Unfortunately my fiance and I both have some pretty serious student loans (on my part due to the stupid decision to go to an out of state school and pay it all with loans): I'm looking at about $90,000 still outstanding and she has $50,000.  She makes roughly $40,000 per year.  We are both 33.

When we decided to live together we initially looked at apartments, but live in a pretty expensive cost of living area.  2-bedroom apartments start for about $1,700.  We made a choice to live with a parent, who has a pretty large house and otherwise would be living alone.  We've been doing this for about a year and a half and it works for everyone because we pay a small amount of rent and take care of most of the chores.  Although this has been working so far we are really starting to feel like it's time to get our own place, and since we're in a much better spot financially and renting is so expensive we started considering saving for a house and purchasing in the next ~12-18 months.

Is this a crazy idea with so much debt?? For the past 10 years I've been a zealot about paying down debt and trying to become debt free; I could continue to do this and have almost all of our debt paid off within 5 years but that's going to mean living with family and delaying having a family of our own until we're almost 40.  My new job is in a very bleeding edge field with a major worldwide company; I know there is always a possibility of being laid off but I don't think the chances are very high (famous last words, right?).  

Our budget, debt, income, and savings situation is below; I'd welcome any thoughts.  

Current Total Savings: ~$10,000 (after earmarked wedding money)
Total Credit Card Debt: &lt; $500 (bills paid on credit cards, paid off same month)
Savings/retirement: 401k/roth contributions out of each paycheck, totaling 10% of income (5%/5% before and after tax split); fiance saves set amount each month.

Electric bill is usually 50 to 80 dollars a month, depends how much I run my AC. 

I don't have a car, I was taking uber/public transit to and from work, so no car related expenses, no insurance or payments or anything.

I have some things I could sell to scrape together some cash if necessary. 

Debt, I have about 500 dollars left on the tail end of a personal loan, dunno the exact interest rate but it's somewhere around 15 percent. No student loans or any other debt.

The way I see it, I have about a month of all expenses covered in savings, with some on the credit card, maybe a little more if I stretch.

I purchased my first house 3.5 years ago for $289,000. My loan value is down to around 259,000 and I am locked into a really good interest rate on my loan, 3.65%. I live in a desirable area in Kansas with my house on a lake (not a lot of water or houses near one around here) and the houses in my neighborhood have dramatically increased their values/selling prices with the last house selling for $430,000. These houses had roughly the same value as my house when I originally purchased my house.  

My question: Is there a way I can take advantage of these rising house values? Am I able to reappraise my house using these neighboring house comparisons to increase my house equity?

personalfinance,Taking extra low interest federal loans to pay off high interest private loans- good or bad?,"Hey all

So my girlfriend is in PA school and needed to take out private loans to cover her remaining tuition costs as well as cost of living expenses during her time in school. She’s almost done and has budgeted extraordinarily well and managed to have enough money left to pay for her last semester without the need to take out extra student loans. 
However- her private loans carry MASSIVE interest levels, around 11-12% while federal loans are all in the 4-6% range. Today, she got an email stating that she is eligible for an additional $30,000 in federal loans for her last semester.  Although she doesn’t need the money (but some would help cover the 6-7 months between graduation and starting her job) she’s wondering if she should take the loans and apply the majority to her private loans to cut down on the balance, since they have double the interest rates of a federal loan.

personalfinance,Dealer new car incentive,"Hi, PF.

I am currently making payments on a 2016 Hyundai Sonata Hybrid that is worth \~11K, according to online sources.  I still owe \~13K.

Today I received a call from a Hyundai dealer I had dealt with in the past.  The caller said that Hyundai is making a offer to people paying Hyundai Motor Finance based on their payment history  (believable, cause I haven't been late or anything in the 2.5 years I've been paying).  Basically, if you trade in your old Hyundai, and buy any new Hyundai, they will finance it at two ""tiers"" lower than the interest rate you would otherwise qualify for.

I was skeptical and asked some questions.  Yes, apparently it is ""any"" new Hyundai, even if its cheaper than your old one.  Apparently Hyundai is also giving this dealer a rebate of $2250, so my ""upside-down-ness"" would be irrelevant.  I specifically asked if she could tell me what the interest ""tiers"" are and if she could ballpark my interest rate based on my credit score (688-690.)  I know, I know.  I'm still waiting to hear back, but its evening here, so I'm sure I'll have to wait until tomorrow.

I can afford the car payment I make now ($346 monthly, @4.0%), but if its possible, I'd definitely be interested in getting a more affordable car and payment.

Does doing this make sense at all?  Does it depend on the actual numbers she comes back with?

personalfinance,Pay Off Loans or Contribute to 401k?,"I am a couple years out of college and graduated college with about $120k in student loan debt.

My loans are about $89k as of today. 

The breakdown of my loans is about $61k in private at 4.58% and about $29k in federal on a graduated payment plan at 4.17%. 

My goal is to get the private done, mostly for peace of mind, by end of 2020. The plan is aggressive but my budget is set very strategically to get this done.  

However, in order to achieve this, I am forgoing contributing anything to my 401k to release some extra money during this period. My company doesn’t match, but automatically contributes 3% even if I contribute nothing. So no matter what I’m still getting contributions. 

My question is does this make sense to do? I really just want the peace of mind of getting most of my debt out of the way. I will still have about $23k in federal left at the end of 2020 but figure I can knock that out over a few years and it’ll be easy. 

I know my 401k will grow more than the interest rate on my loans but is it smart to ignore that for peace of mind? I want to get out of debt so I can focus on saving for a house, wedding, etc.

*new balance - $23,540.05 (+$2,280.19 refinance charge)

*new monthly payment - $420.36

*new interest rate - 4.29%

*number of payments - same. 55 payments

&amp;nbsp;

I have no idea which one is better. Obviously I was looking for a lower interest rate on my loan, with no idea of there being a ""Finance Charge"". However, the $2,280.19 refinance charge just doesn't seem to be worth it. I will pay off my credit card in full in the near future and the next pay off would be this car loan. Trying my best to pay off the car by the end 2019.

&amp;nbsp;

Should I refinance or not? Any help/comments are appreciated.

personalfinance,How is net income calculated when you contribute to pre-tax advantaged accounts?,"Scenario A -- No contribution  

* You make 100k gross salary.  
* Your effective federal income tax is 15.41%  
* Your effective state income tax is 5%  
* Your effective FICA tax is 7.65%  
* Total tax rate of 28.06%  
* Net income of 100k * (1 - .2806) = 71940

Scenario B -- Calculate tax bracket after contribution, deduct new total tax rate from gross (non effective) salary  

* You contribute 10k to 401k.   
* You make 100k gross salary. (effectively 90k after contribution)  
* Your effective federal income tax is 14.55%	
* Your effective state income tax is 5%  
* Your effective FICA tax is 7.65%  
* Total tax rate of 27.2%

cybersecurity,Best path to acquire security clearance within cyber security career,"I am currently a network analyst but am transitioning into the cyber security realm fully. Ultimately, I want to provide myself with the best and most efficient opportunities that will lead to the best career ladder and salary. I do have a passion for tech and security (it’s not just about the money), but a man has to look out for his family first and foremost. 

Living in northern Virginia means I  have plenty of government and private sector job opportunities. But which path would be easier to receive a security clearance? Does the level change the answer to the previous question? Clearances add a lot of value to the resume and allows for greater opportunities, especially here in the NOVA area. 

What do you guys think: easier to get a security clearance by working for a federal agency? Or by going with a private company that contacts with the government? Thanks.",technology

personalfinance,Take a new loan to pay off old loan,"Hello, i have a debt about 100,000,000 coins . Assumed this is the currency of my country.

The minimum payment for this loan is 3,700,000 coins per month for 48 months.

I have paid the minimum payment for 1 year, and the total amount of coins to pay off the debt is about 80,000,000.

I plan to make a new loan of 80,000,000 to pay off the debt above.

The minimum payment for the new loan is 2,100,000 coins per month for 48 months, or 3,100,000 coins for 36 months.

&amp;#x200B;

If i take the new loan, i will have 3700000 - 2100000 = 1600000 coins to save and pay off the old debt.

But i will need to pay off the new debt in 48 months (additional 12 months compared to old debt).

It seems the calculations is lacking something.

Please help to guide me in this financial problem.

&amp;#x200B;

Updated :

From what i checked,

I have 32 months left in old loan, it means 3700000 x 32 = 118400000

If i take new loan with 48 months, it means 2100000 x 48 = 100800000

If i take new loan with 36 months, it means 3100000 x 36 = 111600000

&amp;#x200B;

So the new loan has better interest rate i think.",finance

personalfinance,Should I wait to finish my car loan?,"I have $657.85 left on my car loan and I could pay off the rest of it with my paycheck next week, but I've paid enough extra on the loan that my next payment isn't due till March 2020. I'm engaged and planning on my fiance moving here in a few months and we'll get married with a small simple wedding soon after that.

I've been living with my parents and helping them with bills because my dad is disabled and my mom only works part time. Now that my dad's full retirement has kicked in, I can get my own place and move out. I know living with my parents and younger siblings would be tough on my fiance, so I really don't want to put her through that any longer than we have to.

I found some good deals on condos to buy and I can easily save up for the down payment, but I don't have a lot of time before my fiance gets here, so that $657 will help get that going faster. I have an excellent credit score at 781-787 and a student loan with $17,000 left. Will having a little left on a car loan affect the new mortgage interest rate or anything else about the new loan?

personalfinance,How do I get an 80k loan in a new country (Spain),"Hi all!
Shot in the dark as I've not been in the system long enough in my country and am hoping for a realistic loan rate from somewhere that won't make me pay out twice the original cost.

So, I used to live in the UK and had great credit there as I was able to get a mortgage for a house and I was always, jointly with my partner at the time, on time for bills etc. I moved not thinking I'd ever want or need to buy anything requiring a loan as I'd save up instead.

However, I've come across a plot of land with a small house that looks as if my heart drew it.
I've been saving since I found out about it last year and thought I had another year but as the property is co-owned by 4 siblings, some are wanting to get rid of it sooner. 

More people have been coming to see it and I'm getting worried my efforts aren't enough.
Unfortunately I don't have any friends or family I can ask for a loan but my partner's parents have a 40k house to be sold as collateral, I'll still be saving etc. So realistically the loan would be paid back within 2-3 years, everything is just taking time that I don't seem to have in regards to the property. I've spoken to the one co-owner I know who says its unfortunately not up to him and the 4 would only accept a down payment if the place was paid off within a few months. 

I just don't know who or what to approach as I'd be able to pay a better interest rate than banks would give on a savings account, and pay bigger chunks as and when rather than a monthly payment but have no hope of getting the system to help me out.

I'm not begging or scamming (says a stranger on the internet, yup, I know), I've just never felt like this about anything before and I feel like I'll regret it for the rest of my life if I don't at least try.
Thanks for any and all suggestions!",finance

investing,Is AMZN a strong “buy and hold forever” stock?,"Why I think AMZN is amazing:

Amazon is basically dominating every industry and doesn’t seem to be slowing down in trying to dominate more. It’s slowly but surely killing stores like Macy’s and JC Penney and even slowing down the growth of dominant delivery firms like Fedex and UPS. 

And furthermore, it’s not even trying to make a profits yet. It’s focused more on earnings growth. There are still many things that they can monetise further like AWS. Once Amazon becomes a habit in people’s life, they can start charging higher prices and make even more money. Amazon is less like a huge player in the game, and more like the game itself. It’s literally trying to be every company.

The only stopping AMAZON’s dominance seems to be the government. 

But why isn’t everyone stocking up on AMZN? When it’s obviously going to be the most expensive company soon?

The market cap can easily be the first company to reach $2trillion.

personalfinance,"26 year old thinking of getting a $10,000 loan","Last year was very rough and I ended up owing some money as well as not really having anything in my bank account. I just got a good paying job(better than my last one) which I’m earning about $50k a year. As I owe some people money I want to pay them back as well as have some money in my account for the time being.

I want to get a loan now because I’m still struggling as I just only started working at my new job. I have looked at 2 banks I would go with. One being the one my friend has been with and he recommends it and the other being the bank I have banked with for years.

These are the options:


Bank 1
Option 1
- Early repayments without penalty
- Variable rate
- Interest rates start from 7.88% and can go up to 18.82%
- Comparison rate from 8.72% p.a. to 20.22% p.a.
- Redraw facility

Option 2
- Early repayments without penalty
- Fixed rate
- Interest rates start from 7.93% and can go up to 18.87%
- Comparison rate from from 8.77% p.a. to 20.27% p.a.

Bank 2

$0 application fee
$0 early exit fee

10.69% p.a. (variable interest rate 1) / 11.36% p.a. (comparison rate2)

I would like some advise on this please as I have never taken out a loan so obviously wouldn’t know which would be best. Thank you.

Edit 1: I want to take out this loan because at the moment I have $0 in my account and I get paid $3500 monthly. Next week I will have to pay for my car rego which will be about maybe $1500 all up including maintenance to pass road worthy certificate. I also send money back to my family $400 monthly and I have not been able to do so for 2 months now and they are not doing well because of that.

I would not have considered taking out a loan if I didn’t have to pay for my car rego so soon. I need the car to go to work. Other than that I would say my weekly expenses would be about $100-$200 for food. $95 monthly for phone bill, $80 gas per month, and $35 monthly for car insurance.

I’m thinking that by taking out this loan it will give me some room to breathe. Thank you all again for your comments.",finance

personalfinance,Things you should know,"Consolidated best-practice tips that should be part of your common knowledge:

- A higher tax bracket due to a raise doesn't offset the whole  raise, since the higher rate applies only to the amount in the new bracket.   (You might lose some income-limited deductions, though.)

- Likewise, all  employment income goes in one bucket to determine  tax liability.  Your overtime / bonus is taxed the same as regular income, even if it is withheld at higher rates.  You square that up when you file.

- Keeping a significant savings account while paying 20%+ interest on an outstanding credit card balance means you are losing something like 18% annually on money that could pay down debt.

- If you take out (or keep making payments on) an interest-bearing loan to help your credit history, then you are spending money to get a better credit rating.  That's backwards.  You want to improve credit at no cost to  save money on loans.   

- You want to always pay off the statement balance on your (interest-bearing) credit card each month without fail.  That will keep you from paying interest.   You don't have to pay the full balance, since that includes any new charges.  Just the statement balance.  

- There is no appreciable downside to an online High Yield savings account with a 2.0+% interest rate, vs. keeping the money with your local bank at .01% or some such thing.  

- Credit unions are a great source of day-to-day banking services if you want better service and competitive rates.  Some credit unions have easy-to-meet membership requirements.

- You won't get a risk-free, high  (&gt;~3%) rate of return on your investments in any standard financial services product.   You can compensate for higher risk of stock market investments by leaving  the money for a period of five to ten years, to allow time for growth to overcome  price fluctuations.

- There are generally no federal gift taxes due to either the recipient or to the donor (giver), even on largeish gifts of tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars.   If you give someone over $15,000 in one year, you file a form  that reduces your lifetime exclusion, but you still don't pay gift taxes.  

That's all I can write up at the moment.  What else comes to mind that everybody should know?

btc,Imagine Blockstream did to Linux what they’re doing to Bitcoin.,"Imagine Linux was such a great hit, that when Linus released it, he was scared tyrants like Eicrosoft and Opple would absolutely shred him to pieces for having done so: He brought down their empire, basically.

Because of this, Linus releases Linux and disappears.

Now imagine one company, say, Eicrosoft, invests in another company called “Blocklinux” and that company now dominates the source code of Linux, limits its swap memory to 1 MB only, because EVERY USER MUST BE ABLE TO INSTALL LINUX on every other toaster or carrot peeler.

Now and obviously, savvy users notice the absurdity of what Blocklinux is doing and they point out the huge fuck up in letting Blocklinux control the source code of Linux, they also point out that the same old tyrants (Eicrosoft and Opple) are the ones investing in Blocklinux and are basically destroying Linux so that their own products continue to thrive.

Now Blocklinux not only controls the source code, they also control free speech on most venues where Linux discussion took place. They proceed to flat out deplatform and ban anyone who dares to point out their obviously tyrannical path. They also call big daddy Eicrosoft so that they invest in LinuxDesk and pull favours with Lorbes, LNN, LNBC, LewYorkTimes, and many others so they all join in on the same disinformation campaign “Linux is bad as an operating system because it’s only limited to 1 MB, but it’s an amazing store of screen savers!”

Now Blocklinux starts to develop products to extend the Screensaver capabilities of Linux so that it can also work as an operating system! However, that can only happen if you trust Blocklinux with your swap memory and use “Linuqid” and “Linuxing Network” and other abominations just to restore some features that essentially Linux had since day 0, and it would have continued to have hadn’t Blocklinux artificially limited the swap memory size to 1 MB.

Now, when the community who are fed up with Blocklinux’s agenda decides to fork Linux into FreeLinux to save it, Blocklinux goes on a blind rage and calls their fork “FreeX” (freaks) and sends trolls and shills everywhere FreeLinux people hangout to call them FreeX and defend and shill for Blocklinux.

And that’s why you’re here here shilling for Blockstream my friend, because they’re essentially Blocklinux but with Bitcoin.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Federal Student Loan Deferment to Travel?,"Some background on me: I am graduating this weekend from University in the United States. I have no job lined up right now because I am planning to spend a year traveling to explore the world, discover my true inner self, etc. I am going to spend a portion of my time visiting a number of community development projects, trying to discover my fit within such organizations, as well as try to discover some needs that could be solved in new ventures. All of this is self-funded at this point from savings acquired through past summer internships and other jobs. However, it will require working odd jobs or remote freelancing along the way to fully fund.

My issue: I am graduating with Federal Direct Subsidized and Unsubsidized Loans – not an insurmountable amount, but enough that, because I am generally cash-strapped, I would like not to have to worry about paying them back while I am traveling. I know there is a grace period of 6 months, but it would be really helpful to extend that another 6-8 months. I have looked into deferring them, but the forms indicate that I must either be working full time and experience financial hardship or I must be actively seeking full-time employment, neither of which is exactly true for me. There is the option for deferring when working on a fellowship, which has some similarities with what I am doing, but this is all self-funded and self-directed. 

Does anyone have knowledge on this subject, or has anyone else done something similar? Any advice would help!",finance

investing,Copper and the Bond Market: Take 2,"A few weeks ago, we wrote about copper. We discussed the metal and its behavior as a solid depiction of the world economy. Moreover, we explained copper is typically seen and used as a leading indicator of economic health and the economic cycle. Remember, rising copper prices mean rising demand for copper and thus, a growing global economy. The blog post concluded by suggesting that rising copper prices may be sustained by accommodative monetary policy and perhaps even an interest rate cut. This would be bullish for the stock market, especially since copper and the S&amp;P500 share a strong positive correlation.

So, how has copper behaved since last summer?

The week after our blog post, copper prices continued to rise, but didn’t manage to break out of their previous highs in late February and the 1st of April. Prices have continued lower throughout the last few weeks. Our short term trend for copper is bearish and the main trend is now highly compromised to the downside.

The behavior of copper prices described above isn’t really that surprising when we look back at the economic data that was released. Let’s review: U.S. March Industrial Production showed the slowest rate-of-change year-over-year for manufacturing growth since July 2017. March headline Consumer Price Index (CPI) data from the Eurozone, Italy, France, Germany, and the UK confirmed the ongoing slowdown in domestic economic activity. Consumption and business fixed investment both slowed, too. According to Chris Low, Chief Economist at FTN Financial, the aforementioned are the keys to sustainable growth. Income growth was also reported. We learned it mainly fell throughout the 1st quarter, which isn’t a positive sign for future spending.

Additionally, the bond market doesn’t seem to be convinced that the U.S. economy is as strong as media headlines and GDP suggest. The 10 Year Treasury Yield peaked in early November 2018 at 3.239%. It hasn’t recovered since then, but rather has continued to move lower throughout 2019. Similarly, copper peaked in early June 2018 and has moved lower since then, regardless of the improvement we saw in the first quarter 2019.

Yesterday the 10 Year Treasury Yield closed at 2.448% and seems to be ready to test the low of March 27th at 2.374%. Lower treasury yields are usually associated with both lower economic growth and inflation.

Although tariffs are the main focus in the media, in our opinion, they merely triggered the recent weakness in financial markets. We doubt, however, that they’re the main culprits, considering both the bond market (10 Year Treasury Yield) and copper prices have been validating the global economic slowdown for months.

In terms of sales and earnings growth, about 421/499 companies in the S&amp;P500 Index, reported sales growth of 4.53% and earnings growth of 1.84%. In the technology sector, 52/68 companies reported sales growth of -0.75% and earnings growth of -5.95% for the first quarter 2019. This compares with results in the mid 20’s in the 3rd quarter 2018.

The question we should ask ourselves is this: How likely is it that next quarter’s results are going to be better than the current quarter’s results, as economic data slows? If the answer is “very likely,” then we’ll be in an expanding economy with low inflation and not much to worry about. But if the answer is “not likely” and the U.S. continues to slow in the next quarter, then we have a problem unless the Federal Reserve continues its dovish path. Considering inflation is not a threat, they should be able to cut interest rates soon.

In conclusion, it seems the U.S. is a growing economy, although slowing down, with moderate to no inflation. This can be confirmed by looking at copper and commodity prices in general, a very efficient form of analyz~~i~~ng inflation and economic trends.",finance

personalfinance,First time through the college process as a parent,"This is the first time I have ever posted in a forum, so if I am breaking all kinds of online etiquette rules, I apologize upfront.  

 I know I really screwed up here.  But I'm trying to make the best financial decisions possible as I get closer to leaving this world.  I'm looking for some advice on paying for my kids' college educations.  I'm 48 Years old, and my first child is going to college in the Fall of 2019.  

Our financial situation is as follows: 

1. Our household income is at $132,000 per year and hasn't varied more than 2% in each of the last 15 years.

2.  My wife and I are both Teachers.  

3.  We have built up zero in savings or an emergency fund, outside of our Teacher Retirement System in Texas.

(please don't lecture me on the careless stupidity of our situation....I know.)

 4.   We are homeowners with an outstanding mortgage of $231,000 at 4.15% APR to be paid off in 22 years.  The Market Value of the home is approx $345,000.  In 2012, we bought the home for $242,000.  We refinanced the home once already to pay for installation of a swimming pool, a few years back.     (Cash-out Home Equity Refinance possibility)

5.  The only debt we have is 3 car payments totaling about $1100 per month with balances of  $5,000; $9,000; and $16,000 respectively.  All of these loans are at very competitive rates.

6.  No other considerable assets or debts to mention.  We live paycheck to paycheck, but rarely carry a balance on credit cards)

7.  My credit score is 806 and my wife's is 793.

8.  Child was told her entire life that she can go to any college she qualifies for within reason, and we will pay for it.  She will be attending Texas Tech Univ  (telling her she has to go to community college at this point is not an option)

9.  Child is in Top 25% of her graduating class with a GPA of approx 3.95 and an SAT Score of  a little over 1200  (does not qualify for Achievement Scholarships/gifts).  She applied for over 15 scholarships with no success.

10.  Cost of Attendance is about $27,000 per year.  Our Expected Family Contribution from FAFSA is $25,000 per year which is nuts to me.

11.  TTU Financial Aid ""Award"" Offer is $5,200 per year on mostly unsubsidized Govt Loans.  (I don't think of Loans as an Award, but apparently they do)

12.  Due to the fact that we are both Teachers, we don't have any considerable increase in income expected in the near future.

13.  The kicker is, I have another daughter that is about to be a Junior in high school, and will be going through the same process in 2 years.  However she has a Texas Guaranteed Tuition Plan (bought for $17,000 in 2003) that will pay for 132 hours of college credit at any Texas Public University or College).  This should at least help.

14.  Neither one of them are expected to get any needs-based scholarships or achievement scholarships  (Welcome to our ""average"", middle class, productive contributors to society Family)

I hope I've put enough information to paint the entire picture of our predicament.

&amp;#x200B;

I knew this day would come, but always thought that the horror stories of trying to pay for a kid's college education were exaggerated.  I'm coming to find out that as a ""Middle-Class, Anglo, 2-Parent-Income"" family, the stories are pretty accurate.  Our Expected Family Contribution of $25,000 / year is a joke.  If we tighten-up on spending even more than we already have, and put about $500 per month towards her college, we will still need to borrow an estimated amount of close to $20,000 each year (or $80,000 for her entire degree).  All of the advice I find online about paying for a child's college education doesn't pertain to most of my situations.  I have to believe there are more 50 year-old adult families that are in a similar situation, and have a great, sound financial plan to get through it.

My questions are these:

1. Am I F###ed?  I mean like completely.
2. At this point, would my smartest move be to do a cash-out refi loan and start back at 30 years, losing all equity I have in this over-valuated home?  Although I think I would only be able to get about $50,000 cash out. 

3.  Pay for the remaining estimated $30,000 by getting a private loan, or getting a portion of that by first maxing out the amount that the government will loan to my daughter and myself at about 5% and 7% APR for a term of 10 years, then obtain a private loan for the rest of it?

&amp;#x200B;

Any other constructive ideas would be greatly appreciated.  I apologize for being so long, and for being such a dumb-a$$.  I don't mind being blasted, as long as you could please also put some reasonable solutions or ideas in the comments as well.

Side-note:  I have a BBA in Finance, and thought I had everything under control without financial advice up to this point.

personalfinance,How much of an emergency fund should I realistically have?,"Hi friends,

I post occasionally, but I've had this topic on my mind as of late: how much of an emergency fund do I realistically need to have? 

Here's the summary: in an emergency situation cutting out all discretionary spending and putting student loans into forbearance, our monthly expenses are around $2k a month. We have an emergency fund of $6k right now, or 3 months. I also automatically contribute 5% of my salary ($60k) to the emergency fund to slowly build it.

The reason I'm pontificating on this is because we have a decent chunk of student loans- $47k between the two of us, that I would like to pay down more aggressively than we already are, but I was planning on spending an additional $6k this year to bolster the emergency fund further. She has one private loan at 9.7% in particular that I want to destroy by end of year; her federal loans average 4.1% in interest and mine average 4.6% in interest; 1/8 of these loans (one of mine) is above 4.5%, so really I only want to get rid of two loans with any urgency.

Firstly, I owe 60k in student loans, and I was thinking of consolidating them at an interest rate of 5.125% through the government. I want to put a lot of money towards it to pay it off in 3-4 years. I was wondering if this is a good idea as opposed to paying low amounts over a longer term. I can afford these high payments now and would be able to live a modest lifestyle outside of my necessary expenses. 

I have also been thinking a lot about retirement savings. I want to retire early if possible. My employer currently requires a 3% contribution of my salary with a match of 12% (yes, I realize how generous that is). I am vested at day 1. I have already began to put this 3% in and am earning the match. However, I also have an extra $2,600/yr that I am currently putting into the 403b retirement account. 

My question is as follows, should I put this extra 2600 dollars into the 403b retirement account, or open up a Roth IRA account and put it in there. I have been told and read up to invest in low cost index funds and let it grow as opposed to have it managed by someone with fees. I don't know much about this and would like to optimize my savings for the future, whether this means adding to the 403b, creating a Roth IRA or something different. 

I plan on seeing a financial planner soon for some guidance and was also told to ask the planner if they are a fiduciary (John Oliver episode) to ensure they are acting in my best interest. I hope this wasn't too incoherent of a read and I appreciate any and all feedback. Thank you so much!",finance

Thing is, when consolidating loans, it averages the interest rates together. So consolidating just my highest rates together will do nothing, but consolidating my low interest rates with the high ones will also increase my interest rate effectively on those lower interest loans. 

Is there a general rule for pairing certain numbers of high and low interest loans together to get the biggest reduction in money paid over time? Is there a really good calculator out there where I can test which combinations of loan consolidation will net me the most savings?

Please let me know if this isn't the proper area to ask for help!

I didn't grow up in a household where money was managed or even thought I'd need to learn. Now I'm definitely paying for it. I've been researching a good amount of options and with how much debt I have I've come down to a debt settlement company or a nonprofit debt management program. 

From what I've gathered is the debt settlement company will negotiate a settlement with each of my creditors, but it means I have to stop making payments on the debt until it is settled. Overall it means less money paid towards the debt but I take a hit for not making payments.

My other option is a debt management program through a nonprofit. It was recommended by my bank, but means I pay my debt and they just manage my payments while trying to get me a better interest rate. Basically a safe option that won't affect my credit report at all but more expensive for me.

Let me know what you all think :)

personalfinance,Can paying off an auto loan early adversely affect my credit score?,"So, I took out an auto loan through USAA in May of 2018. The original amount was $16,128.70 with 7.05% interest over 5 years (monthly payments of $277). I knew going in that the interest rate was not ideal, but I was just happy to get approved for a $20,000 dollar loan without any real income and no co-signers. Also, I had never applied for a loan, and my only other line of credit is a secured credit card that has a limit of $1300. (After some back and forth, USAA accepted the monthly payments I receive from the GI Bill while going to school as ""income"".) 


Bearing in mind that I was paying off this loan with a relatively exorbitant interest rate, I've made it a habit to throw an extra $723 a month at the loan for several months, so now my balance is down to $7,078.75. Furthermore, I currently have $27,000 dollars saved up. I should also mention that I've read through my loan contract, and there is no penalty for paying the balance early.


Now, here is where my concern lies: will paying off this auto loan early have a negative effect on my credit score? For instance, if I were considering applying for another line of credit in the near future, would it look better to close the auto loan? From my layman understanding of how credit works, it's better to have diversity among your credit accounts, so would paying this loan off close the account on the credit report and therefore make it look like I'm barely using any credit? I feel like there are more things to consider, but I'm honestly pretty ignorant of how this all works. My intuition is telling me to just pay the damn thing off to save myself several hundred dollars in interest payments, but I would like to know from you gurus out there if there is anything else to consider.

Credit cards have about $18000 of balances right now, with minimum payments of about $750/month for all of them. Do the math quickly and that doesn't work out as there is more going out than coming in.

Wondering if it's worth it to dip into the equity a bit and pay off the credit cards to get back on track and to not feel like I'm drowning anymore. Monthly payment on the loan, even at a higher interest rate would still be less than half of all the cc payments.

Banking,Best High-Yield Checking Account,"Hi, I'm really hoping someone can help me out on this one.

I have been using JP Morgan Chase for my checking account for the last 15+ years. I have not had any difficulties with Chase but given the rise of branch-less online banking institutions that offer checking accounts with interest rates, I now realize that I have been missing out on returns. Given that I maintain around 5k to 10k in my checking account (on average) and several online banks offer 2%+ returns on checking accounts, this means I have been missing out on thousands of dollars of interest over the last decade plus. I have 825 credit score, I've never paid an overdraft fee, or any other type of bank fee ever.

I have been scouring and searching the web for various checking account options and have narrowed in on MemoryBank. They offer 1.6% return on money sitting in a checking account, there are no minimum balances required, no monthly fees, there are no number of debit card transactions required to earn the interest rate, they offer personal checks, they have standard fraud liability, and they offer a companion money market account with a return of 2.45%, FDIC insured, 90,000 ATM locations surcharge free, etc. etc. The only drawback to me is that  there is no way to deposit cash. I am fine with this as I can always just give cash to a friend or family member in exchange for a check to deposit. Also I am completely prepared and ready to downgrade to just chat and phone support.

So here are the questions I have:

Does anyone else have any other recommendations or similar competitors that offer all of the above but with a higher checking account interest rate and/or the ability to deposit cash into the account?

Does anyone know if online banks like this only briefly offer rates this high and if rates have been competitive/stable in the past?

Does anyone know if surcharge free ATM withdrawals means that there are not any other fees?

Any advice would be much appreciated.

personalfinance,"IRS Woe is me, please help","\- In 2006, we filed jointly (we were independent contractors and had a lot of deductions). Then in 2008 we received a notice that MY (get this...not my spouse, just ME) taxes weren't filed. We always set our withholding so that we get money back (so we probably didn't owe that year...so we don't have a check/payment to show that we paid). 

\- In Summer of 2008, an agent showed up at the door, showed us a IRS ID Badge, and asked to see our copies of our taxes. We showed him what we had, and he asked to take them to resolve the issue, and we allowed that (that was an idiotic move on our part).

\- In 2010 the IRS contacted us, again saying I didn't file taxes and owed (remember we filed jointly), now we have no paperwork, the IRS guy took it with him.

\- It's 2019 now, and the penalties make the bill upwards of $100K, it's insane, especially since we filed.

\- In the intervening time between 2008 and 2018, I've worked sporadically in startups, just making enough to live on.

\- Someone said something to me about a statute of limitations on federal income tax, something like 10 years, but the way they told me, honestly, it sounded like there were a lot of 'if's', but one thing I DO remember about it, was that if I contact the IRS, the clock on the 10 years resets. I received a letter from them today however, so I don't know if the clock has run out or not (5/9/2019).

\- I don't enjoy saying this, but I honestly don't have the money to hire a tax lawyer.

If you are a tax specialist, and have worked in this type of problem, I'd be very grateful for some specific advice. I don't know what to do, so I just keep ignoring the problem (and I genuinely mean, I do not owe, in my entire life I've never owed taxes...if I did, I'd call them).

I saw some graph when I was like 13 that has always stuck with me that detailed the difference between starting investing at 25 vs. 30. Anyways, here are the specifics.

**Income**:

- $104k + $16k bonus. Base should go up 10% a year for at least the first few years.
- $33k (Partner is a teacher)

**Other money** (probably not relevant at all): 

- $10k in a high yield savings (this is our emergency fund) 
- $1k in Acorns (I use it just for the round up feature)
- $5k in a Vanguard retirement fund (from a summer job when I was like 16 lmao)

**Debts**: 

- $90k student loans. All federal, the majority being around 5.5%
- No other debt

We've got $4,500 a month to play with. Originally my thought was to just throw it all at loans. If we do that, along with my bonus, we will pay them off by around November or December of next year.

However, now I'm wondering if I should be maxing out my 401k and then throwing the rest at loans? I'm worried that year and a half of not investing at all will hurt us more in the long run than the 4 extra months of paying on the loans.

personalfinance,I'm trying to increase my creditworthiness while also saving money. What would be the best thing to do with my current debt?,"My overall goal is to qualify for a mortgage someday. In the meantime, I'm working on two things: 

1) I'm trying to maintain/build a good credit history 

2) Save money for a nice down-payment. 

What is the best thing to do with my current debt given my goals? My debt is basically just some leftover student loans with the standard interest rates for federal loans. My total balance is about $5000, and I still have at least 5 years left to pay them back. The other component of my total debt is a car loan with a low interest rate. It's a simple interest loan with an APR of 1.9% and a balance of about $10k. I still have 2.5 years left to pay it back. Neither the student loans or the auto loan are accruing a ton of interest. 

&amp;#x200B;

I would like to pay off all of my debt before applying for a mortgage (in about 2-3 years). If I wanted to focus on goal#2 (saving as much as possible), I should pay off all debts as soon as possible to avoid interest. However, I'm concerned about goal #1 (building/maintaining a good credit score). Would it benefit me to drag out the loans for their full terms instead of paying them off?",finance
personalfinance,Was notified about my credit score dropping from 710-587 because of a student loan I didn’t know existed being 132 days overdue. Forbearance has been put on for 1 month and backpay and autopay plans have been made. Is there anything else I can be doing?,"So I basically have everything in the title. I got the Credit Karma app a couple of months ago. I have a loan from a private organization that’s around the same amount that’s due for this one. 

Today I get a notification saying that it’s 132 days overdue which I found odd because it’d been paying each month. Turns out my parents took out two student loans for me in 2013. This one is thankfully much smaller. 

I called the creditors the first time and I was told it was going to default soon. I was still under the impression it was still that private loan so I call the organization and leave a voicemail. 

I make an account the actual loan’s website and, lo and behold, it’s there. 18 year old me didn’t make it, so I think my dad took our two federal loans and thought he’d pay them together? (I’m the first one in my family to go to college). 

I set up a payment for the backpay and this month to go through and I call the creditor again. It was suggested I put a forbearance on it, which I did for one month (first one used). I have also set up an automatic payment from my savings to go to the loan each month. 

I know it’ll take time to reflect on my credit score, but I’m trying to not mess up my finances entirely at 24 and be able to get an apartment. Is there anything more I can be doing? 

Thanks!


Edit: I’m not angry with my parents— it was am honest misunderstanding on my dad’s part. He’s paying a second student loan he took out in my name, and my parents offered to pay me back. 

The loan isn’t large, and it’s not a hard hit to my budget. I’m just worried about my credit score going back up.

1. I currently throw the extra 2k at the student loan debt at 5%. Is this financially smart?
   1. Should I be maxing out my 401k/IRA instead?

personalfinance,Social Security and Supplemental Security Income question,"Hello. I’m trying to help my daughter help her mother with her finances. Mom doesn’t do money well. Mom gets $1200 per month Social Security and that’s it. No savings etc. Her rent is $895 per month, so her budget is tight. She routinely gets her SS on the last Wednesday of the month. On April 24th she did as usual. Daughter has access to Mom’s Direct Express where the SS is deposited. Reviewing it she saw what appears to be an additional deposit of $1200 on May 3. It was annotated as coming from the SSA the same as the routine deposit. There is concern that this is the scheduled May deposit arrived early and that Mom will spend it before June rent can be paid. (Daughter handles that transaction). 

However, Mom had a birthday April 30 and turned 65. Some researching turned up the concept/existence (new to us) of Supplemental Security Income, which is means tested money from the feds available for low income individuals over 65. We wonder if these are truly additional funds (which would be terrific). We cannot review Mom’s SS account, Mom has no online access to SSA.gov as far as we know, and we cannot create an account (SSA forbids anyone but Mom to do that).  Mom is a difficult personality, so asking her about it requires effort.  Asking here is easier.  :) Two concerns are that the May 3 deposit is exactly the same as her regular SS benefit and that a calendar of benefit deliveries show SSI as arriving on the 1st of the month. 

So the questions are, does this sound possible, that she is entitled to SSI, and that it would arrive that soon after her 65th birthday? It’s possible that when she signed up for SS the SSA office saw that she would qualify for SSI and arranged for it to kick in at the magical date.  

Any insights would be welcome.  Thanks.",finance

solar,Help! Getting solar before living in a house for a full year,"My wife and I moved into California's Central Valley this past August and are currently looking into solar panels for the house. This subreddit has been a huge help in getting me prepared for this process with knowing who to talk to and the kinds of questions to ask. I started my search on EnergySage and then narrowed it down to some local companies to come to the house for an in-person meeting. 

Two of the people sold Sunpower exclusively and after reading some stories on here and their shakey financial footing, I'm not sure I want to go with them. That's great that they offer a 25-year warranty but are they going to be here in 25 years? The other two, one was offering LG and one was offering Panasonic. Both were pretty similar (see below for a snapshot that I made) but I'm wondering if I should wait until I've been in the house for an entire year to get an accurate prediction of my energy needs. 

Going off of the LG estimate that I received, I should be generating about 985 kWh a month and that would more than cover 8 out of the 9 months that I've lived in the house. For the month of September, I used 1,200 kWh because well it's really \_\_\_\_\_ hot here in the summer as temperatures reach 115. My second highest month was November at 859 kWh, following by December at 852 kWh. Then it drops down to low 700s, high 600s from there.

So should I wait a few months to get a more accurate picture or should I trust their estimates? I told them I am fine paying a little at the end of the year instead of having a system that's generating 1,500 kWH a month and I'm only using less than half that for 8 months out of the year. The house was built in 2005 with a pretty good A/C system, we have an electric dryer &amp; oven and that's pretty much our biggest energy uses. For the A/C system, we use an Ecobee with room sensors, so it's pretty efficient.

Here is a snapshot of the four quotes that I received but like I said, likely not going with SunPower. I'm still waiting for the one company to send me the hard financial figures but when he showed it to me, the interest rate was 6.99% and the monthly payments were way more than the company to the left of it, even though that system was overall more expensive. My PG&amp;E bills right now go from $156-$307, so I like the idea of Planet Solar's payment only being $148.52 a month + the $16 monthly PG&amp;E hook-up payment.

If I could get the Nova quote to a lower interest rate than 6.99%, I would probably go with them because it would drive the cost way down. Does anyone have any feedback on the LG or Panasonic Panels? I looked on Solar Reviews and both companies seem fine and the panels are highly regarded.

Really, any and all advice would be appreciated.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

personalfinance,Should I rent or buy?,"Hi everyone. I'm sure you get this kind of question all the time. I have been thinking of buying a house for the last year. I am currently renting a two bedroom with three other people for $280 a fortnight. I live in New Zealand, and the property market is pretty nuts here, but so is the rental market where I live (although I have pretty cheap rent because we fitted two couples into the house). I'm sick of having flatmates - they are great but they just get in the way and never do as many chores around the house as me. My partner and I have been thinking about buying a house (25 minutes from city centre) or a semi detached house (15 mins from city centre) for 550k. Is this a good financial decision? It seems pretty cost neutral to me, or more expensive to buy a house. I am good at saving regularly, so the forced savings argument for buying a house doesn't help. If we bought a house it would cost about $600 (including rates and insurance but not maintenance) a fortnight for me instead. Obviously we could get a flatmate which would make it cheaper though. If we rented a similar place it would probably be $500. We also don't know if we want to live here in the long term, I do but maybe my partner doesn't - this city has the best job opportunities for both of us but my partner doesn't like the cold. We'd also like to have children in five years. I am 25 and my partner is 30. I worry because interest rates are at an all time low right now and the property market in my city is going to keep increasing - but I'm not sure it will jump to the extent that I will make a significant gain. I have $110000 for the down payment. 

Tl;dr: renting costs me $277 a fortnight (with flatmates), buying a house will cost $600 a fortnight (no flatmates). Rising property market, want to have children in next five years, unsure if will stay living in this city but has best job opportunities.",finance

Total of $1045 and I only paid a $125 deposit to the broker, with the remainder to be paid to driver after shipment.

I scheduled a car shipment to occur on May 13th and even paid an extra $100 to get it within a day or two of the exact date that I wanted. I won't get to the West coast until May 19th so I didn't want to ship my car too early. I explained my situation to the broker and he agreed that we should ship it around or after May 13th. I also warned him that the car cannot come before May 19th because no one will be there to pick it up.

This was booked about two months in advance. I signed a contract with a broker and the date of shipment (or first available date) on the contract was May 13th.

Two months later, broker emails me on May 8th saying, ""driver will be contacting you soon to schedule pickup."" No dates or times listed. I thought cool...we are getting closer to the date so makes sense that the driver will call me and confirm the May 13th date. I had some wiggle room for a day or two before or after that.

A hour later he calls again and I pick up. ""Can I pick up the car in about an hour?"" ""Uh...I actually scheduled it for May 13th."" ""I will only be in town today."" ""I can do it earlier than the 13th but I need a heads up. I can't make it there in an hour."" Driver gets pissed and said he has been trying to call me since yesterday. ""I have no voicemail or missed calls from you on yesterday. Only today. Plus I am out of town anyway."" Driver said I need to tell broker to rebook me with someone else. I happily agree. 

5 mins later broker and the dispatcher for the driver call me, pissed. Broker said that he emailed me the day before and I agreed to a pickup today. Angrily I said, ""I did not agree to this. Your email said nothing about May 9th. Not to mention we signed the contract for May 13th."" ""Well, you have to be on the west coast by the 21st "" (wrong date buddy) ""so we need to ship the car early."" That's bullshit because if you ship it this early I won't be there to pick it up. 

I then ask him to look at the email he sent me. There was a very long pause and he couldn't find the email. He said he is on his phone so he has to wait until he is at a computer. I told him that I am flexible but a few hours notice is not enough time for me and he needs to send a driver who can accommodate the date I agreed to.

After the call I follow up with an email to both the broker and the dispatcher. Dispatcher just confirmed that the driver can't do it after today. Haven't heard anything from the broker yet.

Should I just cancel? Is this typical of a car shipment company? Why would the broker think it is OK to book me 4 days before the agreed contract date when we agreed on May 13th and I paid an extra fee for this date? I am fed up and just want to book with another company. But I paid $125 for this incompetent broker and might lose my deposit. Contract says I lose the deposit after driver has been dispatched. Advice?

***Edit: just want to add that I am somewhat flexible and told both broker and dispatcher I can do anyday May 11th onwards but May 9th and 10th is too early for me.***

***Edit 2: just got another call today from another driver who wants to pick up the car today in a few hours. Broker is an idiot. I told the driver that I really don't understand why the broker even called him, I already told him I can't do anything until the 11th. Driver called broker for me then called me back. He said that the broker said my next option would be to get someone to pick it up on the 15th and deliver on the 22nd. OMFG finally some common sense. Told him that would be perfect! Emailed broker to summarize the phone call and told him to go ahead and book me with the driver on the 15th and/or just wait until next week to schedule me. No response yet (now my 2nd email in a row) but let's see if he puts me with the driver who can come on the 15th.***",finance

personalfinance,EE Savings Bonds,"Hi!

I have a number of EE Savings Bonds that were purchased in the 90s. Well, I have possession of the papers, but most of them are written to one of my parents with me being listed as a POD. The first question is, is it possible to get these transferred into my name? I'm sure I'll need their consent, which I don't anticipate being a problem, but I'd sort of like to just get these to be mine.

That said, I think I understand that because no tax was paid on the interest that'd accrued beginning when they were purchased, that tax will need to be paid when they are cashed out. But, if they're transferred to me, does that mean I'd be responsible for the taxes on all of the 30 years of interest in 5 years when these mature? In which case, if my parents are in a lower tax bracket than I am in 5 years, would it make more sense to keep the bonds in their name and make them responsible for the taxes?

Or, should I take all of these out before full maturity and put the money somewhere else? In total, people spent less than $1000 purchasing these, and they're currently valued at less than $2k. I've got more than half of that sitting at 4% permanently, and the other portion between 2.3 and 2.6%, variable.

I won't get a higher return on a HYSA, but I'd imagine investing in other ways I'd get a higher return. With the job I'm starting next week I'm going to have an after-tax Roth 457(b). There is no way I'll be able to max out the yearly contribution to that this year, so taking the $$ out of the EE bonds and putting it in there might be an option.

&amp;#x200B;

ETA: I have car loan with a reasonable interest rate, and a mountain of student loan debt I expect to PSLF away in 10 years. Also, I am still taking classes part-time (can't stop, won't stop) so it might make the most sense to take all of this and apply it to my tuition for tax-free fun.",finance

personalfinance,"Compound interest from holding long term investment vs student loan interest, would appreciate help understanding the math. Long term, investing seems wiser if you're young due to compound interest","I know this is a question that has been asked probably 100 times on this subreddit: ""Should I pay off my student loans or invest my money?""

To start off I'd like to say that I *believe* I understand both arguements at least as they are typically presented. The typical arguments are:

(For student loans payoff): Benefits are ""guarunteed"" rate of return based on the interest rate of the loan. I often hear the reasoning of ""would you borrow X% interest personal loans to fund investment worth Y amount of principal.

(For investing): Invest if you think the rate of return can beat the interest rate of the loan.

------------------------
My question though relates that neither of those typical arguments seem to (in my mind) take into account the affect of compound interest for a young investor. To me, while putting money towards a student loan does guarantee a X% interest rate of return, it only does so for the life of the loan (typically 10 years). After that, your rate of return in my mind seems to be zero.

For someone young in life, and in my situation who will have NO problem paying off their student loan (I will be a physician and my loan amount is &lt;$50,000), it seems like by investing, using historical S&amp;P returns on average (I know, we could turn into 90s Japan next year, but I am an optimist), If i hold for the 30 - 35 years until retirement at 7%, that is 30 years of compounding benefit of that interest rate vs only 10 years. Short term cash flow is NOT an issue for me, so investing seems to make more sense.

Can someone help me work through the math if that is correct?


**TL;DR: Paying off student loan gives you a ""rate of return"" for the X% interest rate, but only for the relatively short term of the loan. Investing while young instead gives you benefit of historical S&amp;P (hopefully I know) rate for 30-35 years until retirement, which is a LOT of compounding.**",finance

personalfinance,Lower 401k contribution to pay down student loan debt? Bad idea?,"Background of my financial situation:

Combined income for spouse and I: $185,000/year
Current take home per month is about $8700 with my current 401k contribution rate. Hubby has an amazing match (puts in 4% and work contributes 8%) so we will probably leave that alone since he’s contributing the minimum. I’m contributing 12% of my $120k income currently, my employer matches 4% to my 5% and doesn’t match past the 5% contribution. 

Expenses:
Mortgage - $1500

Daycare for 2 kids - $1680 (fml)

MINIMUM student loan payment - $1500

Car loans - $820 at 0% interest rates

Car insurance - $150 (it’s quite expensive where we live so this is probably the lowest I can get until car loans are paid off)

Other misc. bills totaling roughly $500

We don’t carry a balance on any credit cards, but my loans are insane. I have a balance of about $220,000 still left and paying it down has been difficult since before we had kids I hadn’t really accounted for how expensive childcare is, and it’s significantly hindering my ability to pay extra on my loans. I have my lower interest rate loans on an extended payback plan and have been trying to pay down the higher interest rate ones first. I have $30,000 in loans at 8% interest and the rest are all around 5-6% so I want to attack that first. 

Would it be a bad idea to temporarily decrease my 401k contributions to help me pay down this debt quicker? My most recent payroll deduction for my 401k was $607, so decreasing it by half would give me almost an extra 8k pre-tax per year to pay down debt. I figure after my oldest is in kindergarten in a couple years and we have less daycare expenses I can bump my 401k contribution back up. I’m not sure whether it would be worthwhile to mess with it.

btc,"When BTC fees become expensive and the LN fails due to on-boarding fees and friction from those fees, don't use federated (centralized) sidechain middlemen. Bitcoin was create to remove middlemen.","It was considered a ""conspiracy theory"" in 2015 that Blockstream planned to limit normal BTC usage in order force people to use some other future business of theirs. 

Then Blockstream announced Liquid, a federated (centralized) side-chain business.

When BTC fees reach more than ~$20-50 on-chain (peer-to-peer) becomes unusable for most users. At the same time, LN transactions will become insecure because they will no longer be able to use HTLCs (hash time-lock contracts) due to Bitcoin's ""dust"" level increasing. *Your BTC becomes un-spendable ""dust"" when the amount you have is less than the average on-chain transaction fee.*

This should be seen as a complete network failure. Transaction confirmation times will increase by days and fees will outpace the value of BTC growth. Replace-by-fee guarantees that people will be paying more and more without getting any benefit. Fees increase due to the lack of available blockspace, not because the BTC market capitalization is rising. If the BTC price has a panic sell, fees will go up while the value within those transactions will go down. There is no law that says that higher fees are a result of a higher BTC exchange rate - the inverse can be true.

When BTC starts to fail, Blockstream may say, ""Use Liquid! Just trust us."" They **created the problem** and are now trying to **sell you a solution**. It's not a conspiracy theory. It's a business plan.

In the original [Bitcoin Whitepaper](https://www.bitcoin.com/bitcoin.pdf), the purpose of Bitcoin was to remove the inherent weakness of middlemen.

&gt; **Abstract** 
A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution. 
[...]

&gt; Commerce on the Internet has come to rely almost exclusively on financial institutions serving as trusted third parties to process electronic payments. While the system works well enough for most transactions, it still suffers from the inherent weaknesses of the trust based model.

Blockstream is a middleman. Of course they paid developers full-time and as consultants to prevent maximum blocksize upgrades. Of course they are attacking their ""competitors"" like Bitcoin Cash with trolling farms and other Dragon's Den tactics. Of course they are censoring previously open forums like r/bitcoin despite Bitcoin supposedly being about economic freedom. They are a for-profit company that has essentially acted as a gatekeeper over BTC. It's a simple example of corruption.

The reason Bitcoin was a game-changing technology from 2008-2015 was because it was **purely peer-to-peer** digital cash. That is how it got its initial user growth from early adopters and the corresponding USD value. People were speculating on future usability and potential.

Although BTC has limited its potential for actual usage, Bitcoin Cash is continuing the original reason cryptocurrencies were invented. Bitcoin Cash *is* peer-to-peer electronic cash for everyone on planet Earth.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,I need help setting up a personal budget...,"Hello everybody,

I just got promoted at my job from my part-time position and I will be working my first full time job. In addition to this I've been planning with my friend to move out and get a place together so we can move out of our parents' houses. I've always been a very liberal spender, spending money on whatever I want because I've always lived at home and my car is paid for. however now that I have a full-time job and I want to move out of my parent's house I think it's about time I start keeping to a budget. So to start off, let me give a few things about me:

1. I'm 22 and single (I guess this matters because of federal withholding and taxes)
2. I will start making $16.50 an hour starting Monday, working 40 hours a week totaling to about $1,090 bi-weekly after taxes (assuming 13% of my paycheck is taken out in taxes, as has been the case so far) &amp; $26,160 yearly
3. I am looking to move in to an apartment with 2 other roommates in the Fort Lauderdale area or North Miami Beach area
4. I am in school working on my associate's right now and I do get a refund from FAFSA (which I'll be getting in about 3 weeks and I'll be using it to pay off all my credit card debt, \~$1,000)
5. Speaking of credit, my current score is 627 according to Credit Karma (I wasn't very responsible a few years ago) and I currently have two credit cards, one with Capital One and the other with Credit One.
6. I would like to start saving money in a savings account at either Citi or Chase. I don't have any savings right now but I will start contributing 5% to my Roth-401k that my employer provides and matches (fully up to 3% &amp; 50% up to 5%)
7. I would also like to start investing in the market. I'm pretty knowledgeable about investments so I wouldn't need a broker. Would it be better to just put my savings in a savings or MMK or would it be better to split between savings and portfolio?
8. MOST IMPORTANTLY - I want to make sure I'm not struggling to live off $1,090 (btw please let me know if my math is wrong on this). The big reason I'm making this post is to help make a budget so I can be as stress-free as possible when it comes to my budget. Right now I'm constantly living paycheck to paycheck and I get really stressed out by the end of the second week.

So yeah, please, any help or advice I could get from you guys would be extremely, extremely helpful and I would really appreciate it. Thank you so much for taking the time to read this post!

personalfinance,Approach to setting up an Interest-Free Loan between family members?,"I'm starting a graduate program this summer that will cost \~$30,000, and I have recently received an offer from my MIL and FIL to let them pay the complete cost of the program and have my wife and I pay them back over the course of 10-15 years (or earlier, not very explicit terms) interest-free. 

&amp;#x200B;

I understand that there is a $15,000 gift limit per year per person (ignoring in this case the lifetime exclusion limit) and so theoretically I should be able to accept the entire loan on behalf of my wife and I and stay under the gifting limit. When we pay them back, using an agreed upon schedule that setup and locked in Excel, the cumulative payments over the course of every year would be less than the $30,000 we could otherwise gift them every year. 

&amp;#x200B;

However, I've researched into IRS guidelines stating that any cumulative loans over $10,000 between family members could be subject to the minimum interest rates set by the IRS, and thus my MIL/FIL would need to record interest income and my wife and I needing to record deductible interest expense. We would prefer avoiding this altogether, which is why we would want to take an off-the-books or gift approach. 

&amp;#x200B;

As additional background, my wife currently receives Supplemental Security Income benefits for being disabled, and we would not want the loan in any way to affect her monthly benefits. My MIL/FIL are not in desperate need of the 30K immediately after graduation or the following 10-15 years, and we are confident in our ability to pay back the loan considering my wife and I are financially sensible and would treat it like any other student loan/payment obligation.

Between the gifting limit/IRS guidelines, the potential to just have them directly pay the tuition and us pay them back in the future, I figure I must be missing something that prevents the gifting method. Whats the best approach for an Interest Free loan here?",finance

personalfinance,Paying minimums on student loans and investing the rest?,"I came across this post on a different subreddit and am curious to hear your thoughts 

""You’re not taking into account the opportunity cost of paying down the debt versus investing. It has nothing to do with whether the asset increases or decreases in value. If your interest rate is 3-4% and you can get a 6% yield elsewhere, you’re losing 2-3% by paying down the debt instead of investing. You could argue that risk negates the difference, but even given that you will lose money some years, it’s a better strategy provided you don’t lose money in the first two years. I’ve been doing it for five years and my net worth is much higher than it is if I had prioritized paying off loans.

This is doubly true for student loans because the interest doesn’t compound unless you use deferment. For student loans, you should always pay the minimum, preferably just the interest, and invest the rest of your money. You should still be frugal and save as much as possible until you have positive net worth. Compound interest is always greater than non-compounding interest.""",finance

Transient inflation is what they called it, I believe. I haven't gone back to reread the report, so please correct me if I'm wrong here. 

The bond market, being much more massive than the stock market, is pricing in either volatility or lower rates. What gives? The 3m/5y curve, while not super indicative of impending recession, is still an important indicator.",finance

personalfinance,Student in kind of special situation in need for advice on how to get started with his finances,"Hi everyone, 

I'm new to this subreddit, I hope I'm right here. I'm in what I think is kind of a special situation. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a student at a technical university in Europe. I live in a cheap student accommodation, school fees are nearly non-existent and I'm still in my parents family insurance, so this means my day to day living costs are quite low and completely covered, but other than that I didn't have any money to spend/save so far. 

&amp;#x200B;

So this led me to get a student job to have a little bit of money on the side, just for beers with friends or a weekend trip or something like that. First as an assistant at university, then I somehow got into IT and am doing some basic scripting jobs on some projects and now I'm suddenly having some money in my bank account and don't know what to do with it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Of course I bought a couple of nice small things, e.g. a new laptop, but I want to save the rest. So far it's in a savings account at my bank, but from what I gather the interest rate is close to 0... And now I'm completely lost on what to do with it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Investing it is of course the right answer, no? but how? and where?   
I thought of stocks or index funds, but didn't know where to start, so I got an App called [BUX](https://getbux.com) and bought some stocks and index funds, but I'm unsure of how secure this app is. It kind of doesn't feel serious. 

I also thought of crypto currencies, but again, I have no idea where to start reading and informing myself. 

&amp;#x200B;

What other options are there?

personalfinance,Looking for guidance on how to manage my money better,"Hi,

Before I begin with my question, I wanna thank everyone in this community for sharing their thoughts and knowledge.  I’m a constant lurker on this subreddit and I feel like I’ve learned a lot just by browsing.My Background:I’m a 28 year old guy living with my girlfriend in San Jose, California.  I have a bachelors in Computer Science and a Masters in Information Security.

My Income:

I’m employed full time by a company based out of California.  My income before taxes is $160,000.   Out of this income, I contribute 10% to my 401K with Fidelity.  My company puts in $0.5 for ever $1 that I invest up-to $4400. I’m paid twice a month and I’m posting a breakdown here of my last payslip.

Social Security Tax : $415
Medicare Tax : $100
Federal Income Tax: $1070
PRI-State Tax : $465
SDI/UC Tax: $70

This brings my take home pay to about $3800 per paycheck.

My Expenses:

Unfortunately, I am not very smart about budgeting but I do track my expenses and try to live frugally.  I do sometimes help my mom and brother with their expenses which I am more than happy to do. 
My girlfriend and I pay $2750 a month for rent.  On top of that, we spend close to $500 on groceries and $1250 on other expenses like internet, electricity, gas, water, security, Netflix, Spotify, etc.   We split our expenses 60/40 and so my part of the share comes close to $2700 a month.
I do not have any debt whatsoever which includes student, credit card, etc.

My Investments:

As I mentioned earlier, I put 10% of my salary in a 401K account managed by Fidelity.  I’ve invested my money in their ""FID GROWTH CO POOL”.  Apart from my 401K investment, I’ve also opened a Brokerage account with Vanguard.  I’m investing my money with VTIVX 2045 and VTSAX.  I do not have any other investments.

As I am not that knowledgable about finances and investments, I wanted to see if I can get some inputs from this community regarding what can I be doing better.  Are there any pitfalls that I am overlooking.  Should I be investing differently?

Once again, thank you for reading this post and I look forward to hearing your thoughts and comments.",finance
personalfinance,Can’t get rental history because apartment complex was bought out,"The title says it all.

Hey friends, so in 2013 I rented an apartment for 1 year, moved into a house after the lease was up. Fast forward to today and I’m looking to apply for another apartment complex. The only catch is that they are saying I don’t have any rental history because apparently the apartment complex I lived at in 2013 got bought out by another company and do not have record of me staying there. 

They want an extra $450 on top of the $450 security deposit. I work in IT and naturally there has to be a solution to every problem and was wondering if there was some agency that would have this information, regardless of the company buy out? The office staff obviously doesn’t want to help me, are there federal or even 3rd party’s that are safe to use to gather this info? 

I’m completely oblivious to how these things work so apologies in advance.

Bitcoin,As a philosopher and a person who is against contradictions.Why does BTC insist it is peer to peer digital cash when it is not.,"I have a stake in BTC and because I've been telling everyone for 2 years to buy BTC because it is going to free the world and now I've realized this is a lie. I've by my own courage to employ my own intelligence regardless how stupid I may come off so that I may understand. 

First I like to say I've put all my BTC in sigwit on my ledger nano s and been hodling and I'm STRONGLY against wallstreet and the idea of Hodling. I've been mining with 6 GPU's 5x 1070ti 1x 1080ti and Lost a lot of money in this and I've been told Bitmain is centralized and they screw people. The way I understand all of this is miners have one job and that's to find blocks and anything that is going on in a peer to peer transaction is non of their business. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've tried to move my BTC to the Blue wallet and I'm pissed cause I have to pay 1$ on fees to sent it there. This is really expensive and a contradiction to peer to peer. Took me 2 years making minimum wage to build up to 1k in BTC and I'm really pissed cause I've lost a lot of money hodling and to even use it is what I think everyone is doing is to sell it like a stock. Actions speak louder than words and I do not see how LN and the On chain will help people who cannot afford 1$ especially people who will not be able to stay online in places like Cuba. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm worried because LN incentive to stay off chain and use only the second layer in the long run I believe and we all know now that LN will be centralized. Guys, if we had to go as far as to separate Church and State because even a Church can be corrupt than what makes us think LN will not be corrupt? The idea that a poor person wanting to send even .02 cents to lets say Wikileaks is no longer possible and I believe by the evidence of

 [https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin-transactionfees.html](https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin-transactionfees.html) 

We will later be no longer using on chain by the defense of security and to stop Spam and spam is very ambiguous language because It is non of your business if someone wants to send .01 to anyone and their argument is ""what a waste of a transaction is not an argument. If BTC ran fine for 8 years than why are we saying it can scale temporary and yet we're saying it cannot scale. I'm confused and I really disliked Tone Vays because I was watching debates between him and Rogar and Tone Vays said ""I know wallstreet developers"" This is NOT a good thing for BTC the idea that it is a store of value and not as digital cash is at a contradiction. I hear it will be temporary but this been this way for 2 years now and I've used the lighting and I'm NOT happy about it. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm really respected in my RL community and the idea that I've been pushing BTC because I hate the federal reverse I see them as the Major problem in everyday life. I do not want to get rich I just want to keep the fruits of my labor. But I see BTC is just a stock now.",cryptocurrency

The Plot Sickens...

I am passing this on from someone who's
connecting some dots with input from sources he
cannot reveal.

    Here's what it looks like when all the pieces are
sewn together
    It smells like conspiracy and treason. Everyone
needs to read this. Slowly, and patiently, because
it’s very important......

    From 2001 to 2005 there was an ongoing
investigation into the Clinton Foundation.
    A Grand Jury had been impaneled.

    Governments from around the world had donated to
the “Charity”.

    Yet, from 2001 to 2003 none of those “Donations”
to the Clinton Foundation were declared. Now you
would think that an honest investigator would be able
to figure this out.

    Look who took over this investigation in 2005:
None other than James Comey; Coincidence? Guess who
was transferred into the Internal Revenue Service to
run the Tax Exemption Branch of the IRS? None other
than, Lois “Be on The Look Out” (BOLO) Lerner. Isn’t
that interesting?
    But this is all just a series of strange
coincidences, right?

    Guess who ran the Tax Division inside the
Department of Injustice from 2001 to 2005?
    No other than the Assistant Attorney General of
the United States,
    Rod Rosenstein.
    Guess who was the Director of the Federal Bureau
of Investigation during this time frame?
    Another coincidence (just an anomaly in
statistics and chances), but it was Robert Mueller.
    What do all four casting characters have in common?
    They all were briefed and/or were front-line
investigators into the Clinton Foundation Investigation.

    Another coincidence, right?

    Fast forward to 2009....
    James Comey leaves the Justice Department to go
and cash-in at Lockheed Martin.
    Hillary Clinton is running the State Department,
official government business, on her own personal
email server.
    The Uranium One “issue” comes to the attention of
the Hillary.
    Like all good public servants do, supposedly
looking out for America’s best interest, she decides
to support the decision and approve the sale of 20%
of US Uranium to no other than, the Russians.
    Now you would think that this is a fairly
straight up deal, except it wasn’t, America got
absolutely nothing out of it.

    However, prior to the sales approval, no other
than Bill Clinton goes to Moscow, gets paid 500K for
a one hour speech; then meets with Vladimir Putin at
his home for a few hours.

    Ok, no big deal right? Well, not so fast, the FBI
had a mole inside the money laundering and bribery
scheme.

    Robert Mueller was the FBI Director during this
time frame? Yep, He even delivered a Uranium Sample
to Moscow in 2009.

    Who was handling that case within the Justice
Department out of the US Attorney’s Office in Maryland?
    None other than, Rod Rosenstein. And what
happened to the informant?
    The Department of Justice placed a GAG order on
him and threatened to lock him up if he spoke out
about it.

    How does 20% of the most strategic asset of the
United States of America end up in Russian hands when
the FBI has an informant, a mole providing inside
information to the FBI on the criminal enterprise?

    Very soon after; the sale was approved!~145
million dollars in “donations” made their way into
the Clinton Foundation from entities directly
connected to the Uranium One deal.
    Guess who was still at the Internal Revenue
Service working the Charitable Division? None other
than, - Lois Lerner.

    Ok, that’s all just another series of
coincidences, nothing to see here, right?
    Let’s fast forward to 2015.

    Due to a series of tragic events in Benghazi and
after the 9 “investigations” the House, Senate and at
State Department, Trey Gowdy who was running the 10th
investigation as Chairman of the Select Committee on
Benghazi discovers that the Hillary ran the State
Department on an unclassified, unauthorized, outlaw
personal email server.He also discovered that none of
those emails had been turned over when she departed
her “Public Service” as Secretary of State which was
required by law. He also discovered that there was
Top Secret information contained within her
personally archived email.
    Sparing you the State Departments cover up, the
nostrums they floated, the delay tactics that were
employed and the outright lies that were spewed forth
from the necks of the Kerry State Department, we
shall leave it with this…… they did everything
humanly possible to cover for Hillary. 
.
    Now this is amazing, guess who became FBI
Director in 2013? None other than James Comey; who
secured 17 no bid contracts for his employer
(Lockheed Martin) with the State Department and was
rewarded with a six million dollar thank you present
when he departed his employer? Amazing how all those
no-bids just went right through at State, huh?

    Now he is the FBI Director in charge of the

personalfinance,22 years old and went to jail for 40 days.,"Hi as the title says I went to jail for 40 days for a misdemeanor I committed at 14 years old. I've been extremely depressed my whole life and have always had trouble finding motivation to get things done. Now after losing my child, girlfriend, all friends and my reputation in a small town, it's gotten worse. I am currently working in a gas station graveyard shift not making more than $10 an hour, I have now accrued around more than $2800 in debt to the jail/court. In addition to $30 a month to my probation service for the next 12 months ish.

 I have around $3500 in credit card/ other debt already because of my financial situation when I became a single parent at 19. I didnt graduate high school due to my own negligence not helped by the depression/anxiety. One of probation requirements is to get my GED. I also have aspirations of going to university at some point. 

I also need to find a place to live but there isn't much housing as I live in a college town and cant live in student housing. It makes anywhere normal at least $800+ a month. And I cant afford that rent with all my expenses and debt to relieve. I tried working 2 jobs but I got no sleep and I burnt out so quickly I was losing my mind.

I have no clue about finances other than save up and stay out of debt, which I have not done so far. I looked into getting a loan to try and relieve some of that debt, but that just makes another monthly payment and my credit is horrible so I wont get a good interest rate. I currently live with my parents but i need to be out by the end of the month.
I dont buy many things, only a little food or a drink when I go to the store.

My question is, is there anything I can do to at least start making more or quality of life things I can start saving on? 

P.S. I figured I'd ask here knowing I'm probably going to get some comments telling me its karma for my crime or something, but I'm running out of time/options/mental capacity to keep searching.
Also sorry for format, on mobile.

Edit: I seriously cannot thank all of you enough for giving me such amazing advice and support. I wholeheartedly expected most comments to be bashing me but I have had nothing but kindness toward me. A huge weight has been lifted from my shoulders and it nearly brings me to tears to think of you all. I appreciate you from the bottom of my heart. Thank you!",finance

personalfinance,"Father died, figuring out the inheritance","My father died and left everything to my mother, which is great. We can avoid probate as everything had joint accounts. The amount is less than any federal / state estate taxes (&lt;$5 million). My mother is healthy and doesn't predict any major health care costs for next 7+ years.

What we didn't consider is whether there would be advantages to transfer more now by leaving my mom with fewer assets. I'd still pay for anything she needed, but I know there are some calculations made off of net worth that might be advantageous to be aware of.

Really two questions:

1. What advantages or disadvantages would there be by transferring wealth now and have me pay for my mom's care.
2. Can we transfer wealth as part of ""inheritance"" even if his will left everything to Mother, could we just agree to change it after his death?

Bitcoin,FinCEN's latest overreach,"There was a [great summary](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/op-ed-understanding-latest-fincen-guidance-cryptocurrencies/) authored by a lawyer named Sasha Hodder of the latest roud of atrocious pretend laws (mandateless and egregious new ""guidence"" masquerading as if they refer to actual regulations) by FinCen today.

Nevermind that the administrative code to which guidence is supposed to refer is not in existence - that is moot because that administrative code needs to be authorized by specific law, and I don't recall the US Congress passing cryptocurrency amendments to the BSA into law.  Do you?  Even if they had, many would be unconstitutional, and therefore null and void.

It is times like these that I remind myself that there are major freedom battles yet to be fought through the courts with regard to crypto.  This is the first major attack on crypto by the federal beaurocracy who thinks they can legislate at their will.  Well hands off, fuckboys!  We the people will not be pushed around by the control freak paper pushers who want the whole world caged and surveilled.

Relavent link (with great PDF):

&gt; Regulating cryptocurrency software developers and individual users of that software under the Bank Secrecy Act would be unconstitutional under the Fourth Amendment because it would be a warrantless search and seizure of information private to cryptocurrency users.

solar,A couple questions and verification on a solar install quote,"Hi guys, I've been lurking here for a few months, I'm on the verge of pulling the trigger on a solar install but wanted to get a second opinion from the community here on my quotes and pannels....What's getting me off the fence is Washington State just announced a sales tax exemption for solar installs starting July 1st, and this is the last year the federal goverment is giving a 30% credit - so I have this 6 month window where I can max out both State and Federal Incentives.

&amp;#x200B;

The quote I have is for an 8.06kw system (26 Panels) for $19,747 or 10.54kw system (34 Panels) for $25,823 that's without the federal rebate and now, no sales tax.  Due to the house/roof design, the 26 panel system would be more aesthetically pleasing but my percent of solar offset would be about 93%

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I JUST bought a Tesla model 3, so I expect that charging this thing at home is going to add to my energy needs, which is why I asked for the larger 34 panel quote.

&amp;#x200B;

Here are the panels included in the quote

[http://www.silfabsolar.com/sla-m-310/](http://www.silfabsolar.com/sla-m-310/)

&amp;#x200B;

I did notice that between the time of the original design back in February and now, there is a new 320w panel available

[http://www.silfabsolar.com/sla-m-320/](http://www.silfabsolar.com/sla-m-320/)

&amp;#x200B;

Would it make sense to ask about swapping to this panel?  From a production standpoint how much more production should I expect between the two panels, is it negligible?   I have a southern facing roof with no shade, and they're expecting 90+% produciton @TSRF  - EDIT: Washington State has Net Metering in place if that makes any difference....But at the end of the year they won't cut you a check if your production goes over what you use

Good evening all,

As the title says, I am 37 years old and my wife is 27. My wife and I are expecting out first and possibly only child any day now (in delivery room now). 

We work overseas. I currently do not pay/owe state or federal tax as a couple contractor. We are planning on working overseas for 5 more years before taking a job back in the States. I am expecting the stateside job will be 120,000 when I do go back as a government job (GS-13 maxed out). I am assuming it will be in an area where a nice house will be 350,000. I will not move back to a high cost of living location such as Hawaii, California, or DC. Here are the numbers. 

0 debt
0 assets back in the States
130,000 in 401k
130,000 in land (wife's foreign country; retirement land)
70,000 in treasury direct (2.46 interest)
30,000 in savings account
12,000 in a Vangaurd REIT
5,000 in checking to pay monthly bills

I max out my 401k. I am not concerned about my wife putting in money to hers.

Monthly money after 401k, housing and other life expenses all after taxes (OASDI and wife still owes regular tax)

Monthly deposit s
2,400 to treasury direct (wife's whole income)
2,000 to Vangaurd REIT 
200 to sons Vangaurd life time fund
4,000 extra 

-----------------

My goal is to buy a house in full when we go back (250,000). I would then like to build our dream home over a 2-3 year period for 350-400. Once it is built I would rent the previous house we bought. I would then like to buy another 250,000 house to rent another few years after this. I never want to have have more than one mortgage that is no more than 100,000.

I plan on working 18 more years now that we are having a son. Although my career revolves around the government, I would like to build a large real estate portfolio that I can pass on to him (if he becomes business minded).

Although I understand 130,000 is a very good income once I go back to the States, I will never have these next five years again where I pay no taxes and able to save this much in cash. 

When we move back to the States I am assuming to use the treasury direct and REIT for the house(s) we want. 

Is there a better way to allocate money or invest? 

Where should the 4,000 a month extra go. I'm tempted to just put another 2,000 in treasury bills and 2,000 in the REIT. 

Also, if the market crashes in the next five years I plan on moving nearly all of the treasury direct to the stock market through some ETF. If that were to happen, I would probably extend another few years overseas.

stocks,"Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning May 13th, 2019","Hey what's happening r/stocks! Good afternoon and happy Saturday to all of you on this subreddit. I hope everyone made out pretty nicely in the market last week, and are ready for the new trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning May 13th, 2019.

# **What to watch in the week ahead: Trade chatter, key economic data and Walmart earnings  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/10/what-to-watch-in-the-week-ahead-trade-chatter-key-economic-data-and-walmart-earnings.html)**
*****
&gt; Important data on the consumer and manufacturing is released in the week ahead, and investors are watching to see what it says about two key parts of the economy as new tariffs go into effect on Chinese goods.
*****
&gt; The economic reports should show how the economy is faring so far in the second quarter, following a surprisingly strong first quarter. Analysts say the better economy gave President Donald Trump some leverage in his trade negotiations with China.
*****
&gt; But it's the progress of those trade negotiations that the markets care about most in the week ahead, after investors were surprised by a lack of progress in the talks and new tariffs this past week.
*****
&gt; On Friday, stocks erased steep losses and bounced higher after both Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Trump called the first negotiating session following new tariffs ""constructive.""
*****
&gt; Retail sales for April are released Wednesday, and should give a good view of consumer spending as the second quarter got underway. Also on Wednesday, industrial production, business inventories and the Empire State manufacturing survey are reported. Consumers sentiment is out Friday. Besides the data, there are just a few earnings, with Walmart reporting Thursday, and Macy's on Wednesday.
*****
&gt; Stocks closed out a volatile week lower, and the S&amp;P 500's 2.2% decline was still its worst of the year.
*****
&gt; ""The odds of something going wrong are much higher today than they were last Friday, when there was pretty much consensus that a [trade] deal was going to be done,"" said Ed Keon, chief investment strategist at QMA.
*****
&gt; But strategists say the selling could have been even worse in the past week. They said stocks were supported by investor confidence that a deal will get done, and also the expectation that Trump would take action to avoid a market collapse.
*****
&gt; ""I still think that the risks are perhaps skewed more to the downside, than the upside here. Whether it will escalate further is hard to handicap from a risk perspective,"" Keon said. The Trump administration has complained that China attempted to renegotiate their deal, so Trump raised tariffs to 25% on $200 billion in goods and threatens tariffs on $300 billion more.
*****
&gt; Whether the Chinese have changed their view, or their lack of agreement on some issues is just posturing is yet to be seen, Keon said.
*****
&gt; ""The U.S. and China are rivals and are going to be economic rivals for many years to come. Doing a trade deal is going to be like the Yankees and Red Sox doing a trade deal. Nobody wants to be the guy who trades away Babe Ruth,"" he said.
*****
&gt; Luke Tilley, chief economist at Wilmington Trust, said it's not unusual for trade negotiations to hit a rough spot, as they near the finish line. ""What really matters is whether you have those tariffs on for quite some time. Companies have been doing fairly well managing tariffs, whether it's by supply lines or price. The uncertainty is the problem for firms,"" he said.
*****
&gt; Tilley said he expects to see strength in the retail sales. Manufacturing data could be soft.
*****
&gt; ""Our take is that the consumer is still in a very good place. We think a lot of the volatility, some of it was real in the sense it was the government shutdown and the movement of the stock market through December. There were some seasonal adjustments,"" he said.
*****
&gt; Analysts have said the fact the stock market was at a record high; first quarter growth was a strong 3.2%, and unemployment fell to a 50-year low of 3.6%, all likely emboldened Trump to play hardball with China. Likewise, improving economic data in China could have made Beijing believe it had a stronger hand.
*****
&gt; For now, markets are watching to see whether talks continue to be constructive or whether the two sides focus on retaliation.
*****
&gt; Tilley said he expects to see a deal, but if it looks like Trump will move forward with tariffs on all Chinese goods, he would reconsider his stock positions. ""If that was coming and we thought that was going to be in place for some time, we would be forced to reevaluate and downgraded our economic outlook and also the outlook for the markets,"" said Tilley.

# Earnings Estimates Stand Firm

&gt; Earnings growth projections have remained positive globally, even as trade tensions have rattled financial markets this week.

&gt; Lately, headlines on the U.S.-China trade dispute have distracted investors, and a few pockets of the global economy have weakened over the last several months. Fixed income markets have positioned for a marked economic slowdown with the yield curve again nearing inversion (long-term rates falling below short-term rates).

&gt; Uncertainty can be uncomfortable, but in times of market volatility, we encourage investors to focus on long-term fundamentals instead of short-term noise. One of the fundamental pillars we like to focus on is company earnings.

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, earnings in all three major global regions are expected to rise this year. U.S. companies are poised to lead, with consensus expectations for 4.2% profit growth in 2019.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/U.S.-Leads-Earnings-Growth-Prospects-for-2019-1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; “The bar for earnings results is low because of heightened uncertainty,” said LPL Research Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch. “Economic growth may be moderating internationally, but we see enough catalysts ahead to drive another year of record profits in the U.S.”

&gt; U.S. company profits escaped last quarter’s soft patch, based on earnings results from about 85% of constituents that have already reported. S&amp;P 500 Index profits likely grew about 1% year over year in the first quarter of 2019, markedly better than the 2–4% decline expected at the beginning of the reporting season, depending on the data source. Better-than-feared earnings have helped push the S&amp;P 500 to all-time highs over the past few weeks and we expect improving earnings to carry stocks going forward.

&gt; Earnings expectations for developed and emerging markets (EM) are below U.S. projections. However, we think EM earnings projections may be too pessimistic. Global market volatility, trade tensions, and a strong U.S. dollar have contributed to reduced EM growth expectations in recent months, but we think the Federal Reserve’s pause should help cap gains in the U.S. dollar and help fuel stronger global currencies and EM economic activity.

# Uncomfortable, but Expected

&gt; Trade tensions have flared up again, and they’ve caught the stock market off guard.

&gt; The S&amp;P 500 Index has dropped 2.1% over the past two days amid a slew of trade-related headlines. On May 6, the United States announced it would implement additional tariffs on Chinese imports at the end of the week if no trade agreement is reached. In response, China threatened its own retaliatory measures. China and U.S. officials are still scheduled to continue trade talks in Washington, D.C. May 9, but the threat of escalation looms large in investors’ minds.

&gt; Recent market volatility has been uncomfortable, but not particularly surprising given the lack of turbulence year to date. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the S&amp;P 500’s largest pullback this year has been unusually small relative to previous years. Since 1970, the S&amp;P 500 has made it through the first five months of the year without at least a 2.5% pullback only once—in 1995.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/2019s-Biggest-Drawdown-is-the-Smallest-Since-1995.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; On average, the S&amp;P 500 has endured an 8.5% pullback from January to May each year. This year, stocks haven’t come close to that. The largest S&amp;P 500 pullback this year has been a one-day slide of 2.48%.

&gt; “Given the recent run we’ve had, we believe conditions are ripe for an increase in volatility,” said LPL Research Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch. “Though we remain optimistic about U.S. stocks’ longer-term prospects, stocks recently reached overbought levels.”

&gt; While volatility could take over in the near term, we see the resurgence in trade risk as a temporary obstacle to new S&amp;P 500 highs later this year. In our view, current trade headwinds will have a negligible impact on economic growth, and the U.S. economy has emerged relatively unscathed from what is traditionally the weakest quarter of the year. Economic fundamentals also point to higher prices: The labor market is steadily improving, corporate profits are at all-time highs, and inflation is healthy.

&gt; In the meanwhile, we look for S&amp;P 500 support in the 2,775 range, the index’s 200-day moving average. If this level were to be reached, it would represent a 6% slide from record levels, and at the low range of a typical 6-10% market correction. Solid fundamentals and technical support may provide investors with potential for relief from the recent bout of market volatility.

# May Option Expiration Week: Recent Weakness

&gt; Trading around May option expiration is mostly a mixed bag. DJIA has been down nineteen of the last thirty-seven May expiration days with an average loss of 0.12%. The full-week has a bearish bias for DJIA and S&amp;P 500 with records of 20 declines and 17 advances over the past 37 years. More recently, DJIA has suffered declines in eight of the past ten expiration weeks.

# Rotate in May — Top Sectors for the “Worst Months” May to October

&gt; Today we are not going to bother debating whether one should actually sell in May or not. Instead, let’s focus on some tactical adjustments that can be made in portfolios to take advantage of what actually does work during the “Worst Six Months” while either shorting or outright avoiding what does not work all that frequently.

&gt; In the following table, the performance of the S&amp;P 500 during the “Worst Six Months” May to October is compared to fourteen select sector indices or sub-indices, gold and the 30-year Treasury bond. Nine of the fourteen indices chosen are S&amp;P Sector indices. Gold and 30-year bond are continuously-linked, non-adjusted front-month futures contracts. With the exception of two indices, 1990-2018, a full 29 years of data was selected. This selection represents a reasonably balanced number of bull and bear years for each and a long enough timeframe to be statistically significant while representing current trends. In an effort to make an apple-to-apple comparison, dividends are not included in this study.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/3ef156141ee3a14742dbf8c91837f80f/tumblr_inline_pr9c02KFIg1spdppr_500.jpg))**

&gt; Using the S&amp;P 500 as the baseline by which all others were compared, five indices and the 30-year Treasury bond outperformed during the “Worst Six Months” while nine others and gold underperformed based upon “AVG %” return. At the top of the list are Biotech and Healthcare with average gains of 8.69% and 4.85% during the “Worst Months.” However, before jumping into Biotech positions, only 24 years of data was available and in those years, Biotech was up just 54.2% of the time from May through October. Some years, like 2014, gains were massive while in down years losses were frequently nearly as large. Although not the best sector by AVG %, Consumer Staples advancing 79.3% of the time is the closest thing to a sure bet for a gain during the “Worst Months.”

# Market Celebrates Mother’s Day with Gains

&gt; Over the last twenty-four years on the Friday before Mother’s Day the Dow Jones Industrials have gained ground sixteen times. On the Monday after, DJIA has advanced seventeen times. Average gain on Friday has been 0.19% and a respectable 0.49% on Monday. However, in four of the last seven years, the Monday following Mother’s Day has been down.

# Relax It’s May Not China Trade War Fears

&gt; A full blown trade war with China is not in anyone’s interest. President Trump’s negotiating style may be unsettling to the market at times, but neither country is likely to stand on ceremony to save face at the risk to their respective economies and markets. With the market at new highs and up big the first four months this year it is even more prone to short-term weakness in May.

&gt; Our overall outlook for the year remains bullish as it has been since our Annual Forecastin December that was followed by a bullish January Indicator Trifecta. The historical strength of Pre-Election Years, which has been self-evident thus far this year, is supported by resilient economic and corporate readings, a dovish Fed clearly done with raising interest rates for the time being and a White House that is supportive of Wall Street. But, as you can see in the chart of Pre-Election Year Seasonal Patterns below, the Dow (black dotted line) and S&amp;P (green dotted line) are already at historical average gains for the Pre-Election year and NASDAQ is way ahead of the pace up more than 20% for 2019 to date.

&gt; Ostensibly, the S&amp;P and NASDAQ are on the brink of clearing the last levels of resistance. But the Dow is struggling and Russell 2000 is well off the pace. S&amp;P and NASDAQ made new all-time highs last month, but are straining to hold those levels and there is chatter in technical analysis circles about a bearish double top forming on the S&amp;P and NASDAQ. Also evident in the chart here is the weakness often experienced in the latter part of May. So while we remain bullish on the year, we do expect the market to be weaker during the May soft patch and backing and filing during the Worst 4 Months July-October.

financialindependence,A perspective on FIRE from a non-FIRE guy,"So I'm not a fire guy. Our life goal is to maximize the amount of quality time we have. The s.o. and I do take our personal finance seriously and both have about a 30% saving rate with clear allocated budgets for expenses. However, we work as little as possible while still maintaining this standard of living and our long term financial goals. 

This means we both work 3 days a week and are off for 4 to:
a) create, maintain and explore meaningful interpersonal relationships with people and each other, 
b) exercise to stay healthy and fit so we can enjoy our leisure more and stay healthy and strong longer,
c) persue creative projects and satisfy our own curiosity.

Now it is my understanding the conventional method to FIRE is to maximize your saving rate so that you can invest and maximize long term compound interest. If you do so, you can reliably retire early. This seems like a very sensible financial construction and I applaud the willpower and dedication involved.

However, I feel like (so I don't know really) that in a lot of cases 'investing' in the points a,b,c I mentioned above also has a 'compounded' interest rate in psychological development, connection with mind and body, interests and social life.

Some anecdotal evidence to support this feeling of mine can be found in a lot of posts on this forum with people that really don't know what to do when they're FIRE'd. I feel often the advice boils down to 'go make friends, persue a hobby, get into sports' or points a,b,c I posted above. This is very solid and sensible advice, however, I would argue that the progression you could have made on these points are also subject to 'compound interest' and therefore, you've missed out a lot in this regard and need to 'invest' a lot of time in it to catch up again! If we accept these assumptions it seems totally fine  because now you have a lot more time on your hands to invest in these endeavours.

I'd like to now present some arguments why I still think FIRE is not an optimal path to long time fulfillment and happiness. 

Firstly, science tells us that you're more socially active and make more lasting meaningful relations when you're younger. I interpret this to mean that if you try to make new friends at fifty it will be much harder to do, let alone get into a stronger interpersonal relationship with your partner.  
Secondly, sports will get much harder to do over time, and health benefits rack up over time. At 50 you're very injury prone compared to a younger athlete.
Thirdly, creativity and curiosity diminish over time.

A pro-FIRE argument I can make is to set up your progeny for a better future (savings for college , emergency medical fund etc), but we live in a very high social welfare country so this argument weighs less for us. 

I'd like to add that I feel FIRE can be a very sensible lifestyle and I thoroughly believe a lot of people can benefit from it significantly. I'd very much like to hear any thoughts about these arguments from the FIRE community!

For context my s.o. is a health professional and I'm a project manager for international research projects.",finance

I have a savings account with a bit under 1k from working odd jobs the past few years, but the APY is only 0.01%. 

I was thinking about getting a Caputal One MONEY account which is a checking account/debit card account for teenagers (0.25% APY, no fees or minimums), or an Ally/Marcus account for the higher interest rates.

personalfinance,W-4 withholding calculator + RSU's,"Recently got married, and the significant other and I are trying to use the withholding calculator to file our W-4 accurately. Neither of us claim any exemptions, and we aren't/weren't planning on doing so. Further, we each were going to use ""Married, but withhold at single rate"" option in the W-4.  

My work grants me an RSU, which vests at a regular cadence across the financial year. The RSU administrator, historically has withheld less in Federal Taxes as compared to my tax bracket, hence I have been withholding extra to compensate for that. They have since rectified it, and I am able to withhold at the tax rate comparable to the tax bracket both of us would be in.

I punched in all the fields of the worksheet for both of us, with putting the (estimate) income from RSU in the wages &amp; salary section and not in the bonus section. Similarly, I put in the prospective taxes that are going to be withheld from the RSU vest in the ""Federal income tax withheld to date"" section (in addition to the actual amount of tax withheld to date).

The output of the calculator is saying that we are withholding way too much and asking us to take 6 &amp; 4 exemptions respectively as well as withhold at ""married"" rate. It feels like I am doing something wrong. Should the prospective income from the RSU sale be in the ""bonuses"" section? Or should I have not put in the taxes that will be paid for the RSU sale in the taxes withheld to date section?",finance

personalfinance,How to help hma from crazy uncle draining her finances,"I am going to try to make this simple.

I am a director of Finance and Administration in Oregon.  I have a great career that pays me well, with stock options that are fully vested, I am a homeowner with less that 5 years left on my mortgage so I really have no need for extra money, lets get that stated right now. 

Uncle is a 59 year old homeless veteran and paranoid schizophrenic. Thinks aliens(black people) have poisoned the water, that the government has installed devices in his brain, and refuses medical care from VA and is living in his car in LA, California. He is very, very violent and unstable. Stated many times he thinks they have treasure in the back yard that needs to be dug up, really concerned about thier money, etc.

Gma is 77, Gmpa 70 and he just died last week. They have a joint will. My cousin is fuduciary and we both have copies. The will basically writes out everyone in the family by giving 100.00 to each child and then a 50/50 split of about 300k of whatever is being managed by Edward Jones to myself and my crazy uncle. If the will is contested, then that person gets 1.00.

Biggest issue is gmpa was pretty wary of banks and would take out $ and put it in a safe when the checking account got too high, and was doing this over about 30 years. I shit you not, I flew down 4 days ago to see gma and help with arrangements, and this lady has 700k in CASH split between 3 safes. Not to mention the firearms (at least 50 if them) gold coins, australian and black opals as big as my fist, family heirlooms etc. Its a safety nightmare. They dont use computers and she has the safe combinations written down in a book, tucked on a shelf in one of the guest rooms. 

I was able to get her to take out 325k in cash from one of the safes and put into the safety deposit box that they have w a local bank. Also put my name on it as well as 3 checking and 2 savings and let the bank know if she comes in w anyone to withdraw money to file an elder abuse report and call me immediately. Me and her also have a safeword, so if she calls me or texts me I am to call police immediately and get the first flight down. 

Turns out she sent 2k to uncle to come up here for the funeral, he is scheduled to arrive anyday. She has told him many times he cannot live with her, but then says she wants to give him 5k per month to help him out. She will only be getting 2.6k per month. She needs to be able to survive herself, and he has had 59 years to get help for himself. 

She is a wreck, tried to get me to take the rest of the cash for my 2 kids college funds. Obviously thats is not going to happen. But if she is trying to be so generous to me, what the heck is she gonna do when the uncle comes down? She has a very hard time telling uncle no, and was caught sending money to uncle last year and that is when gmpa had the joint will made so she couldnt change anything in case he passed first. Also, she doesnt understand she cannot change the will and says she is going to shred it as she is saying the 5k per month she wants to give uncle is his inheritance...she just doesnt understand the will, but I believe that gmpa was trying to look out for her. Some other family members has also come out of the shadows and have contacted gma to buy some firearms from 1909 as well as gmpas vehicles. We have not even had his funeral yet.... I am raging as I type this. 

I am terified uncle is going to move in here and drain her finances and then hurt her. I can clearly see him barracading himself on the property and collecting her money while she is stuffed in a freezer.

Please, what can I do? I dont want to leave her but I have to go home and work and take care of my kids and my heart is broken for her. Do I file some kind of report with the local police dept? She she just has noone locally to watch out for her as they were pretty big hermits. She needs her money to last her at least 15 more years.",finance
stocks,Questions about the fed.,"Ive just got through the banking section on the ""khan academy"" finance course and theres been a few things that i found confusing about the fed, i chose this subreddit to ask because the fed is linked very strongly to the stock market, the questions i have are:

1.what does the fed do with the treasury bonds that they buy on the open market? I know that they buy bonds so that they can try and lower interest rates but i was wondering what they do with the bonds they buy, does the government pay the fed like they do if a normal person held the bond, or is it sort of just written off?.



2.when the fed buys or sells massive amounts of bonds in order to manipulate the money supply, will that not make it a bigger problem in the long term, like if they sell bonds wont that lower the short term money supply but increase the long term supply since interest has to be paid on those bonds?.

3.when the fed sells bonds, do they sell bonds that they previously bought or do they create new bonds, if they sell the ones they previously bought then what would they do if they wanted lower the money supply more but didn't have enough bonds to sell?.",finance
personalfinance,Car Decisions for a new resident,"My work will require me to move to the US within the next two or three months. I will be based in CA for the first year and a half and then move to the East Coast (either NY or NJ).

Since I will be moving with my family, buying a car quickly is high on my list of priorities. However, while researching resources it has become obvious to me that with my limited credit history, getting a decent car loan will be problematic despite a decent income ($1xx,000 pa). I'd like r/personalfinance's opinion on the best approach to getting a decent car

&amp;#x200B;

* Option 1 - Buy a cheap used car (approx. 8-10 year old for about $10k), use it for the 1.5 years I'll be in CA then sell it before moving to NY/NJ
* Option 2 - Buy a good car new, using a co-signer with excellent credit. The problem here is that my co-signer for the loan is based in NY. I'm not sure if that will be an issue for a loan in CA.
* Option 3 - Buy a good car new, without a co-signer and pay the higher interest rate for about a year or so before I refinance the loan.
* Option 4 - Lease a new car with or without a cosigner. But I'm not sure if I can start a lease in CA but return it 3 years later in NY/NJ. I know the advantages of owning v/s leasing, but at this point I don't know if I will be in the US beyond 3 years.

My question is this. If I am to buy a place or rent an apartment in a state with no income tax what do I need to do to not have MS come after me for their state taxes? Is the move worth it? I’m paying about $12,000 a year in state taxes and I am rarely ever in the US.

personalfinance,"Questions regarding credit (lines, cards, loans) (CAN)","Hello PF!

I am wondering what your experience with prime rates are, specifically, the lowest interest rates you've had on credit cards, lines of credit, and loans.
Personally, my lowest rate is 9% on a line of credit. Are there any of you with significantly lower rates?  

I'm also curious about credit increases. My main credit card has been offering me increases steadily, and I've jumped by over 400% in how much credit I've had on that card alone, not to mention higher starting credit amounts on other credit cards I've applied for.  If I keep my utilization low, will they continue to offer to raise the credit on my card? If so, at what point do they stop? Do banks raise the amount of credit available on lines of credit too? 

Could it hurt to have multiple credit cards if I am responsible with them? I have read that if they are unused, the company could close the account, so if I were to have 10 cards and put $100 on them each month, would that be sufficient to keep them open? What if I had 20, 30, hell, 50 credit cards, spending only $20 per card per month, just to say I use the card?

This would be win-win for the employer and the employee since company match doesn't contribute to the limit the employee can put in their 401k per year,"It was kind of hard to explain this perfectly in the title, but you probably get my drift.

If I make 100k per year with 5 % company match to my 401k. The federal limit for me is $17.5k, bringing my total to $22.5k per year into my 401k.

Heck that dude, pay me 80k per year, but jump that match to 20%, meaning my total to 401k contribution would be $33.5k.

- the company would pay me less money (win for them)
- I get more money in my 401k (win for me)

Obviously, these are just ball park figures and this example might be a tough deal to bite on, but you get my drift. 

So is there a legal reason why this can't happen? As far as I know, there isn't a maximum employers can contribute as a 401k match. So the loser here is the government since they would get less tax money in this situation, but I don't see it specifically stated anywhere that this is illegal?",finance
personalfinance,Should I sell my rental and refinance primary home?,"I own a rental property with about $90K in equity (valued at $210K). I currently make about $300 per month from rent and take a loss each year which gives me a decent tax return. I’ve owned the home for 5 years and it’s a great location in a hot market. 

I’ve also owned my own home for 1 year, valued at $460K and owe $400K. It’s a 30 year loan and still paying $200/month on PMI.

Question: Should I sell the rental property and invest that money in my primary in order to refinance to a 15 year? I estimate I’d drop approx 1% interest rate for roughly the same monthly cost, plus get rid of the PMI. 

I’ve considered the $300/mo I’d be losing in rent vs saving on the $200 PMI. I’d also lose the tax break on the rental plus the monthly principle, but saving much more in interest with a 15 year loan on my primary. 

Is there anything else I’m missing? Any advice is greatly appreciated.",finance
personalfinance,Should I quit my job?,"So here’s some background info on me. I’m a full time college student and I have about two years left until I will graduate with a bachelors in marketing. I am very fortunate that I still live at home so my expenses are very minimal. I’m getting fed up with my job and I’m considering if I should stop working entirely for the next two years to focus on my grades.

I technically don’t NEED a job to survive but I like making money and saving as much as possible. I usually make around 1,600 a month and put around 70-80% of my paycheck in savings. I have about 25k in my personal savings account which is my emergency fund. 

Tuition will cost me 7k out of pocket and my monthly expenses are ~$500. So I should still have around 5k left in my emergency fund when I graduate.

However, if I continue working I could save even more but it would be at the expense of my grades and I could take longer to graduate.",finance
personalfinance,"22 years old, need options and help for cc debt repayment","So I'll be out of college next semester, winter graduation because I started off-sequence in the spring and have about 6 months grace period before my \~$30-40,000 student loan payments begin, so realistically I have about another year before that kicks in.

What I'm really worried about is the $11,000 of credit card debt I've accumulated throughout these past 4 years. The reasoning behind this debt was a combination of extenuating circumstances and basic living. About a year ago one of my roommates left me high and dry out of our lease (literally disappeared) and the landlord didn't take kindly to it, so I was on the hook for the remaining months. Living off campus has been way cheaper than living on, which is primarily what I had to take the student loans out for since it was required my first two years.  

I've always held a work-study job that pays me over minimum ($10/h) which I work the max 20h/week, and for about a year I worked a second job on top of that but I wasn't able to work 40 hours a week while also doing full time in school. I started to fail out of classes and had to get extensions and talk to professors because I wasn't even sleeping due to the scheduling. 

I have a cheap apartment that I split with my partner (we each pay $500/month, utilities included) and a $100 phone bill and I qualify for food stamps, which I use. The rest of the debt has been used to buy a bed, text books, basic house goods and because I usually only make enough to pay the rent and phone. Early on when I got the credit cards I definitely used them to go out once a month but since I saw the balance increase I've been living as frugal as possible.

I've applied for numerous debt consolidation loans, asked the credit card companies via phone to lower my interest rate, and even tried to take out a private student loan to cover costs or pay the cc debt so that I could have more flexible options to pay it all down, but each of these options I've been rejected from. Until last month I always found a way to pay the minimum by doing some sort of side gig or online work but I couldn't and defaulted on every minimum payment, and my credit score tanked.

The only other thing I can think to do is pursue bankruptcy. Once my student loan payments kick in, there's no way I'll be able to pay the minimum for everything, and from the looks of it I won't be able to get a job over \~$30,000/yr in my city for my field. Even with the 6 month gap between when the student loans kick in, if I work two or three jobs and can defer the student loans I don't know how long it would take to pay off $11,000 plus 9+ months of late fees, as I can't see myself being able to pay anything in the foreseeable future until December (summer is not an option due to research grant funding -&gt; not working, not being able to pay, only sustaining off university stipend).

I'm just not really seeing a way out. I understand that $11,000 in retrospect isn't that much. But it's honestly hard to live at the moment without a car in a commuter city, the student loans looming and almost nothing to live on.

Family isn't an option as they're worse off than I am. Parents didn't even qualify for parent plus loan.

My rent is $150pw, not including food. 

I earn approx $300 a week working 5 days a week (less this week as I've been sick) before tax, so I've been looking into money lenders and applied for a personal loan (minimum is 2k), which so far has been denied as I haven't had the best credit score in the past.

Is there any way to easily recieve the money for these things without much interest? I thought a credit card may be a good option but I'm unsure if the interest rate is higher for them vs a personal loan. It feels a bit stupid to be paying off a 2k loan for 24 months with the rate at $48pw, seeing as I'd be left with $50pw to buy food and gas, its not exactly saving.

Any advice would be appreciated, I've never been the best at saving and currently have $0 in my bank, which after rent goes straight to gas and food.

financialindependence,[FIRE] Thank you.,"Quick background. Started my business in late 2015 to make at least $3,000 per month so I could still support my monthly expense. My hard work paid off, and by Mid-2017 I made my first MILLION in profit. My bank account was healthy, and life was good financially. By the end of 2018, I had 2nd million in my bank account

Now (May 2019) my business is not as profitable, and my partner is thinking about early retiring. Due to this reason, I might sell my business to a potential buyer. Usually, this would have upset me, and I would have lost my confidence but Thanks to r/financialindependence.

When I made my first million, I started looking around to do something with my money (money should make money). That's when I came across FIRE on r/financialindependence. I have invested (lending money) my total of two million, and I get a high-interest rate (APY 6%) $10,000/month into my account. I consider this as another income &amp; my monthly expense is still less than $4,500

I don't think I want to retire right now so will help my friends  &amp; family achieve their success. Also, work on a few side projects.

I wanted to Thank everyone for sharing their story &amp; helping the community planning their retirement.",finance

**Python (experience: 1 semester)**

* I've little background in Python, so I decided to go for it; I did Python for the whole semester simply for the sole purpose as an investment for my future skill sets e.g. I know some employers want Python Data Scientist (and I can always ask for more $ if I finish this course!)
* But I find Python to be having some learning curve and I need to spend more time to debug. Unfortunately since I'm **holding a full-time job**, this is not necessarily a good thing (though in the long run, getting better in Python is a actually good!)
* I notice I'm also doing mistakes in my DS assignments do to lack of experience with Python.

**R (experience: 1 week)**

* I just started using R within this past week and it's been really nice; I'm not too sure if R is simpler than Python, or the fact the Python has made it a lot simpler for me to learn R - mixed feelings here.
* I heard there isn't much demand for R Data Scientist so ... mixed feelings as well here.

**Excel:**

* There would be time I got so fed-up debugging Python codes or I just don't have the time anymore, I went to Excel.

personalfinance,Which One Should I Pay Off?,"Hi everyone, I rarely post but I really need advice on what the best course of action is here.

I received $2,961 from my tax returns. I have 2 choices here:

Choice 1 - Pay off my last credit card in full. Balance is $2,284 and the interest rate is 19%. I pay about $60 toward it each month (it’s set to pay the minimum balance, I know this is bad). 

Choice 2 - Pay off my car in full. Balance is about $2,400 and the interest rate is. Monthly payment = $232 and it’s due to be paid off March of 2020. 

My dad thinks I should pay off my car and free up the $232 in cash flow that I can then pay toward my credit card. The downside is I’d up paying more interest than if I were to pay off my card instead. The plus side is, like my dad said, more cash flow. 

I feel like I’m leaning toward paying off the card. I don’t know how disciplined I’d be paying the $232 toward the card. I think I’d do well, but I don’t want to test it. 

Also, not sure if it matters but maybe it’s worth mentioning that I make a base salary of 45k with bonuses which should earn me about $10,000 on top of that. I’m also expected to receive an additional lump sum of $1,250 by the end of this month but it’s not guaranteed. H

I’m so torn. What do you guys think?

personalfinance,PMI question - to pay down mortgage?,"To start, our home appraised at $250,000.  We purchased it for $243,000 almost three years ago and got tacked with PMI (3.875% interest rate on our mortgage if that’s helpful).  I’m not sure of the current value and don’t really believe Zillow as it says $298,000.  Redfin says $266,650 which is a little more realistic.  Anyway, the PMI is not excessive, but it would be nice to get rid of it.  We are also looking to move within the next year or so, but I have a small concern because...

We have come into some money - about $100,000 when all is said and done due to a relative passing.  Due to the way it was distributed, we got $55,000 and will get the rest in January 2020.   We don’t have any credit card debt, and I only have a little more to pay on my car payment. 

We don’t know if it’s better to use some of that money to pay down our mortgage in order to remove the PMI (and ultimately lower the amount we owe) or just put it all in savings until we are actually ready to move/seriously look for a new place.  Of course I have searched Google and Reddit, but everyone has a different situation and I’m certainly not an expert in this field!

Like, say you actually do get the things you're chasing, what the fuck then. Oh yay I got my piece of cake, yum yum. Ok whats next on the menu .... to which the only answer is ... a sky full of stars and eternal limitless silence. 

So with that said, the rich must surely know this. They must fill  up on coke and whores and shooting last remaining animals with golden bullets at some point, ... or is it biological?

Two federal student loans totaling $3,270.
A private student loan totaling $11,049 with a monthly payment of ~$160.
My student loans are my lowest interest loans and easiest to handle.
My problem comes in that I have two (2) high interest loans that I fell victim to in a time of desperation. 
The first loan totals $4,086 with a monthly payment of $547.41 and an interest rate of 119.56%.
The second was for $1,700 at 244.64% with a monthly payment of $408.42.
I have two credit cards.
The first currently totals $186.19 with no current issues on monthly payment.
The other card has a balance of $587.54, it’s tight with the other bills.

My rent is $450/month 
Utilities total $200/month

My credit is currently 558 with what I recently found are two accounts in collections, one totaling $267, another $1,515.

coal,New York makes serious moves to phase out coal power by 2020,"In a serious response against Donald Trump’s support for the [coal industry](https://energy.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/coal/environmentalists-file-complaint-over-kosovos-coal-project/69308117), New York Governor [Andrew Cuomo](https://andrewcuomo.com/)has gone all out by saying that the state’s new carbon reduction rules are in tandem with his 2016 pledge to go coal free by 2020.

[Photo Courtesy: Business Insider ](https://i.redd.it/z9jtv6tnmyx21.jpg)

According to records, coal as a fuel, has generated less than 1percent of the electricity in 2017 for [New York](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City). Of the four coal fired power plants in the city, only 1100 MW has been available for service. This is because several units have been underutilized due to cheaper and more environmental friendly energy options like natural gas. Statistics confirm that one megawatt can power about 1,000 U.S. homes.

Additionally, in order to further save guard the interest of the environment, New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC) further proposed regulations earlier in 2018 that restricted Nitrogen Oxide (NOX) emissions from small natural gas-fired peaking power plants.

Cuomo said the emission control rules will help move the state closer to meeting the Green New Deal he announced in 2019, which requires the state’s power to be 100 percent carbon-free by 2040.

The state has also mandated that 70%t of its electricity come from renewable sources by 2030. New York currently gets about 30 percent of its electricity from renewable sources, according to federal energy data.",energy

I found out yesterday (US Mother's Day) that my dad has not paid federal income taxes in at least 10 years.  The IRS letters were being sent to his business PO Box and he stashed them away in his office the entire time.

Now my dad is struggling with health issues.  He can't drive, can barely walk and will be scheduled for major surgery as soon as he is well enough to undergo the procedure. He's of nearly no help.  He can't remember breakfast most days and seems to honestly think this is no big deal. 

The latest IRS letter that my mom intercepted b/c she is the one checking the PO box now says the IRS will start to seize (levy) assets as soon as June 2019.

She is waiting on a tax pro to call her back.  She has been calling since Wednesday is doubting they really want to help.

The business he ran was in a highly regulated industry with its own set of challenges.  Untangling the business records (for me and my mom) will be nearly impossible.  From a look into his QuickBooks, it appears he quit logging expenses and only created invoices and recorded payments. 

What do we do?

personalfinance,Transfer Balance,"All, so I've been attempting to ring in my debt. I've read a lot about snowballing and avalanche methods, and conveniently, my balances and interest rates work out to be the same in either method. I have 3 cards. The larger of the 3 - which has the lowest interest rate 24.49% is sitting at $6,000. They just sent me an offer to do 0% promotional APR on Balance Transfers thru 07/20.

My other 2 cards one at $479.69 with 26.24% interest and $381.38 at 26.99% interest. I'm curious on thoughts of transferring these balances over to the more expensive card. My logic behind it is 0% interest on these balances but it would increase the card with a larger balance. I'm paying a total of $336.92 between the 3 cards and there is a $4% charge to transfer over the balanced so if I did my math right, it would be $35 bucks. 

 Before doing it, I wanted to get thoughts from others.

personalfinance,Best High-Yield Checking Account to Use?,"Hi, I'm really hoping someone can help me out on this one.

I have been using JP Morgan Chase for my checking account for the last 15+ years. I have not had any difficulties with Chase but given my discovery of branch-less online banking institutions that offer checking accounts with interest rates above zero or 0.01% interest rates, I now realize that I could be missing out on returns within my checking account to try to stay up with inflation. Given that I maintain between 5k to 10k in my checking account (on average) and several online banks offer 2%+ returns on checking accounts, this means I have been missing out on thousands of dollars of interest over the last decade plus. Given that I am 33, I have decades more time to earn. I have 825 credit score, I've never paid an overdraft fee, or any other type of bank fee ever.

I have been scouring and searching the web for various checking account options and have narrowed in on MemoryBank. They offer 1.6% return on money sitting in a checking account, there are no minimum balances required, no monthly fees, there are no number of debit card transactions required to earn the interest rate, they offer personal checks, they have standard fraud liability, they offer a companion money market account with a return of 2.45%, FDIC insured, 90,000 ATM locations surcharge free, etc. etc. The only drawback to me is that there is no way to deposit cash. I am fine with this as I can always just give cash to a friend or family member in exchange for a check to deposit. Also they obviously don't have physical branches - I am completely prepared to downgrade to just chat and phone support.

So here are the questions I have:

Does anyone else have any other recommendations or similar competitors that offer all of the above but with a higher checking account interest rate and/or the ability to deposit cash into the account?

Does anyone know if online banks like this only briefly offer rates this high and if rates have been competitive/stable in the past?

Does anyone know if surcharge free ATM withdrawals means that there are not any other fees?

Any advice would be much appreciated. Thanks!",finance
personalfinance,Best place to house a pot of money for yearly insurance payments?,"Hey, PF:

Besides my emergency fund, I have a CapitalOne 360 Money Market account that I deposit into weekly for a future home purchase in the next 2-4 years. I want to open up a separate account to throw about $50/week into as a pot for my yearly car/renter's insurance.

personalfinance,I am a 29yo lone parent with tons of debt... help,"Hi Personal Finance friends,

I swear I am not as financially illiterate as I act but I have been overspending for the last... \~5 years and I can just hear Gail Vaz-Oxlade's voice in my head, ""you're a money moron"". I am a lone parent- daughter is 9 years old. I put myself through University with student loans (graduated 2016) and I have a decent job with the government (been here 1 year). Due to childcare restraints finding a second job is not an option, so cutting expenses is my number one priority. My biggest issues are that I have about $60k in student loans and a $32k brand new car loan. The other place where I find myself over spending is on gifts. I'm at that point in my life where my friends are getting married, having babies, and birthdays. I love giving gifts, even if it means overspending.

I'll also say I'm located in Canada. I have a good credit score - 743

I'll start with my income:

Employment - $1422.05 biweekly (some months I get paid 3 times, May is one of them)

Child support - $285 twice a month

Child tax benefit - $431.61 a month

Total monthly income - $3845.71

Savings:

I have a savings account I tried to contribute to, I use it for emergencies - $590

TFSA at main bank - $2,030

RRSP from last job - $3,590 (don't think I can touch this)

RRSP personal - $5,155

TFSA at diff bank - $5,870

Total savings - $16,650

I also have a pension that I contribute to through my work that is matched by my employer. I have no idea what's in it and I wouldn't be able to touch it anyway.

Here's one of my biggest problems - I have a $4,000 overdraft that I got when I was with my ex-fiance to help pay for wedding expenses.. We never ended up getting married and I didn't use this overdraft until I finished uni. I find myself creeping deeper into it every month... Right now the balance is in the red $2255. Every time I get paid it goes against this balance. Also, the reason I haven't used my savings to pay down my debts is because without a plan I know I will just continue to overspend and pull from those savings and eventually have no savings and more debt.

Debts:

Overdraft - $2255

Credit card - $2655

Student Loan (through provincial govt) - $22,299

Student Loan (through bank) - $25,506

Student Loan (through federal govt) - $12,620

Car loan - $32,608

Edit to add: I have looked into selling the car, it would be at a loss (at least $10,000). Yes, buying it was a mistake, I have had it for a year and maintained it, at this point I'm just planning on driving it forever. Also, I was in a car accident last year and I will eventually receive a settlement - I have no idea how much this will be I'm thinking between $5,000-15,000 that I would use towards this debt. 

I honestly forgot what a disaster this payment is to me, because up until about 2 months ago I was paying on 2 car loans... Last year I bought a (not brand new) car, put $2,000 down on it, and I was rear ended and it was totaled after owning it for 1 week. I need a vehicle for work so I was stressing out and ended up buying that brand new car, as we all know was a giant mistake... I just recently paid off that other car loan with my tax return. So I felt like I was doing alright with that one payment.

Monthly Expenses:

Rent - $1249 a month - going up to $1285 in July

Child care - $50 a month during school, will go up in July &amp; August

Tenant &amp; Car insurance - $198.99 (is going up June 26 to $235, I have been calling around getting quotes, I can get discounted insurance through my union that look like they will keep my payments the same)

Govt student loan - $112.57

Govt student loan - $199.95

Bank student loan - $299.46

Car loan - $496.24 a month + $20.12 insurance for the loan (disability &amp; life insurance)

Life insurance - $61 a month

Heating - \~$60 a month

Phone bill - $110 a month

Cable and internet - $130 a month (in July I will be cancelling my cable reducing this bill to about $80 a month but currently have been in a contract for the last 2 years)

Singing lessons for daughter- $60 a month

Total - $3112.33

Not including Gas and Food, after I pay all of my loans and bills I have $733.38 left over

I added up all of the money I spent on food (groceries, snacks, coffees, eating out)

&amp;#x200B;

March gifts - $286.63

April gifts - $103.75

May gifts - $116.97

&amp;#x200B;

Ok, so now that I've done the math I see that gifts aren't my biggest problem but eating out and buying coffees and snacks and groceries is.

My rough plans going forward include not buying coffee (I brought k-cups to work to make my own), not going to restaurants (In March I had a bday dinner and also took my mom out to dinner), and not buying snacks.

I have celiac disease so meal prep is a priority for me but I still have some extra restaurant costs that I can go without. Buying gasoline is unavoidable - my commute to work is 22km one way. I am also in a long distance relationship and visit my partner (900km roundtrip) at least once a month.

My priorities are:

1. stop using my overdraft and feel safe enough to close it
2. pay off credit card debt
3. create a budget that includes a portion for gifts and stick to it for 6 months
4. get to a point where I can add to my savings again

personalfinance,"Just landed a 52k a year Job, want to tackle 30k of CC Debt &amp; Student Loans","Hey guys I just landed a job that pays 52K a year, it's non-exempt and has the following financial incentives:

* 6% Match 401k
* 6% Performance Bonus

&amp;#x200B;

Location: FL

After taxes, my take-home pay will be $3,600 and my total expenses are as follows:

$1,550 a Month (of which $500 is going towards a Consolidated Loan) - this does not factor in 6% Match, and Healthcare/vision/dental when I choose them.

Debts:

* $14,000 Consolidated Loan @ 16.49% APR that can be refinanced after 6 payments.
* $16,000 Students Loans @ 4.19% Average APR ($175 Monthly Payment has been paid by my folks)

&amp;#x200B;

Now I'm aware the Loan is pretty high, but that's the consequence of my financial immaturity when I started my adult life; I didn't have a grip on my finances, the initial CC offers lapsed, and my job hunt was unsuccessful for a while resulting in my debt racking up along with higher interest rates (24-27% APR).

&amp;#x200B;

The best choice I made was to consolidate my debt through a loan instead of a debt-payoff company. This has allowed me to maintain a  combined credit limit of $21,000+, and it has raised my credit score back to excellent territory to qualify for better rates when the time comes. I was also told by the company, that after 6 payments, I have the option to refinance the loan, and have it based on my new financial situation (Score, and Income) to lower the Interest rate, which might be worth it taking into account the origination fee.

&amp;#x200B;

After accounting for non-debt expenses, I have a take home ranging from $2,400-$2,500. I've dedicated $500 a month to pay-off the loan, but was wondering if there is better advice on how to manage my finances. Even with the $500 payment towards my loan, that leaves me with $2000 a month.

&amp;#x200B;

Should I simply put forth the maximum amount of payment towards the loan, say $1800-$2200 a month towards it, or continue making payments for a few more months, and then re-finance the loan to then tackle it with larger payments?

CryptoCurrency,Is it morally right to get rich with CryptoCurrency?,"I think this is a valid question that deserves some discussion. Is it morally right to get rich quick just by holding cryptocurrency? This could be applied to any investments but no other asset raises this question as heavily as an asset that promises ROI in the 1,000-100,000% region during the two years of a single bull cycle.

&amp;#x200B;

So let's start off with the accusation. What is morally wrong with earning money by doing nothing? Let's take this a step further. What exactly is money? You can probably dedicate an entire life philosophizing over this topic. But to keep it short, the best answer I have seen so far is this: Money is an expression of how much society owes an individual. As such, money is a ledger that should ideally compensate everyone in the future for their past work they have done for society.

&amp;#x200B;

Now it's easy to see why it's not morally right to get rich by doing nothing. You make other people owe you for nothing. They have to work for your well-being and you don't compensate them with any value given back to society. In contrast to that, a plumber earns money for work they have been doing for society. They need to spend that money to get back from society, for example food.

&amp;#x200B;

This is how society works: everybody helps each-other. We didn't need money when we were still living in caves and everybody knew each-other. If you didn't work back then, you couldn't expect anything from anybody else. But if you were the hunter who helped the group to have something to eat, your tribe will take care of you when you are ill. In today's society, we are missing this transparency. The shop owner has no other way to tell whether the customer deserves something to eat other than through their money.

&amp;#x200B;

So what happens if someone makes a lot of money by doing nothing? Basically no value is added to society, yet money is inflated and becomes worth less. You devalue the work other people have done in the past by devaluing their compensation. And now that you have money, you can pull out value from society by letting people work for your well-being. It's the same thing from two different perspectives. In fact, you are crippling society. You are a parasite to the working class.

&amp;#x200B;

You know why there is so much money to be made with economics? Because the global economy is a huge scam. It's in-transparent and capitalizes on this intransparency, the stupidity of the masses. To quote Henry Ford:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;""It is well enough that people of the nation do not understand our banking and monetary system, for if they did, I believe  there would be a revolution before tomorrow morning.""

&amp;#x200B;

Just today I read a rather interesting article, highlighting the nature of offshore economics. I can only recommend you read this: [http://www.taxjustice.net/cms/upload/pdf/Price\_of\_Offshore\_Revisited\_120722.pdf](http://www.taxjustice.net/cms/upload/pdf/Price_of_Offshore_Revisited_120722.pdf). Even though the numbers are a bit out-dated (article is from 2011), it definitely opens your eyes about the true state of the economic world. Have a quote from page 15:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;What we had uncovered was the existence  of a highly lucrative banking business that had previously not been disclosed in any bank's annual reports, let alone in Treasury or Federal Reserve data bases or Congressional inquiries - even though this had actually become the big banks' *most lucrative* (highest risk-adjusted ROE) business *by far*.

&amp;#x200B;

This is what economics lives on. And ironically this is also my argument on why taking part in cryptocurrency and getting rich is morally right. Cryptocurrency is here to stay. It is only a matter of time until it will be adopted by the average people, the mainstream society, the working class. In a few decades, cryptocurrency will be as valuable to society as fiat is today. Therefore, people will necessarily get rich through crypto. The only question left is, who will it be?

&amp;#x200B;

We are redistributing the wealth. We don't want today's elite, who are well above 40 in age and already have immense holdings in stocks, bonds, funds, precious metals and real estate to take advantage of this market. We don't want the rich people to get even richer. We don't want Warren Buffet to ever appreciate crypto before he actually needs it (ignoring the fact that he won't be around by then anyways). This market is for millennials, to give to them while devaluing the assets of today's super-rich.

&amp;#x200B;

**That's why I think it's morally reasonable to hold cryptocurrency and get rich. It still damages society but making the poors rich is the lesser of two evils, where making the riches rich is the other. Even though I doubt many would do - simply because it's not in the nature of humans during this cultural age - the most morally right thing to do would be getting rich with crypto before fairly redistributing it back to society, where the value was originally stolen from.**",cryptocurrency

* 3 and 5 participants pay more attention to how their peer SPEND (as opposed to SAVE) their money on social media. Additionally they are unsure how their peers afford their lifestyles. 
* Data is divided between ""planners"" and ""non-planners."" Across the board planners seem to do things each month that  add to their savings. (Though it's not clear if they are in a better position to do this because of income or wealth or other factors.)
* Among participants, it will take $2.3M to feel ""wealthy."" 

That last bullet points seems to be entirely unrelated to even the realities of the participants. The number ($2.3M) is about 20x the median US net worth. Despite that, half believe that they will achieve wealth and 2/5th believe it will happen in the next 10 years.

To give you a sense of the delta between an aspirational number like $2.3M and what real people have accumulated take a look at this summary of the Federal Reserve's household networth survey (2016, summarized by [Nerdwallet here](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/investing/how-your-net-worth-compares-and-what-matters-more)): 

* **Under 35:** Median net worth: $11,100 (average net worth: $76,200).
* **35-44:** $59,800 ($288,700). \[median (average)\] note that the average is skewed by ""the 1%""\]
* **45-54:** $124,200 ($727,500).
* **55-64:** $187,300 ($1,167,400).
* **65-74:** $224,100 ($1,066,000).
* **75+:** $264,800 ($1,067,000).

Personally, when I think of wealth it is associated with a number that is very specific to me... A number that I back into by having enough to support required spending (health, food, transportation ,etc) and discretionary spending (better food, more beer, travel, entertainment, etc) and a modest legacy (which also serves as a margin of error for future spending needs). In other words... $2.3M (or $92k annual income) seems to cover necessities and discretionary spending, but NOT at an extravagant level. It doesn't seem wealthy and I can't believe that most of us will achieve it ""in the next ten years!"" I'm interested in hearing other peoples thoughts on this data.",finance

personalfinance,Saving vs Loan Repayment,"My wife (26) and I (27) are doing pretty well financially, but I wanted to get some advice on saving vs repaying student loans. My wife has about $11,500 in student debt that we have been making the minimum payments on since we got married. The interest rate on her loan is around 3.5%. I have a car loan with about $25,000 left on it (72 months; 3.8% interest.) The payment comes out to about $425/month 

On an average month, we make a little over $9,000 after tax &amp; matching my employer's 401k contribution. We also have around $2,800 of monthly bills (rent, phone, utilities, insurance.) The $2,800 does include the monthly payments for the car and student loans. 

Outside of that, we usually spend another $3,000 on things like groceries, going out, gas, shopping, gym membership, pets, and other monthly purchases. 

At the end of the month, we're usually saving right around $3,000. Right now, we've just been putting it into a Chase Checking Account, which has $36,000 in it currently. We are considering moving a good chunk of that into a Discover high yield savings account, since it's currently making nothing with it sitting in the checking account.

With that being said, does it make sense to just start putting the full amount of money saved each month towards paying off her student loans? Or should we leave some to keep building up the savings account?",finance
personalfinance,Should i buy whole or universal life insurance?,"I am 32 years old with 2 small kids and a wife who are dependent on me. I earn around 350,000 / year. I am currently using a term life insurance and putting some of my savings into investments such as mutual funds or index based ETF.

A friend referred me to an insurance agent who is trying to sell me a Non-Qualified insurance plan which i believe is a whole life or universal life insurance plan and gives out around 5% interest rate annually. Their argument is that in the long run ( 20 year plan) it will save me a lot on taxes.

Is it worth it to buy a permanent life insurance based on fixed interest rate or variable universal life insurance with investment in underlying mutual funds?

Assuming i can put 2,000$ a month into these plan vs manually invest them, does the tax benefit in the long run outweigh the fees associated with these insurances?",finance
personalfinance,Federal Student Loan - Wage Garnishment,"Hello Reddit -
​
Need help strategizing how to 1) avoid having my checks garnished since that looks bad for my employer; and 2) possibly cutting a deal for less than 15% of my monthly income?



So I am a 25 year old living in New York City, with a pretty decent job with around ~$100k/yr income, living in a nice apparent which I pay ~2k/mo. All great there.
Problem is, I have been somewhat financially lackadaisical for the past few years, and really did not care for my student loans since graduating college a few years ago. I sort of did not want to deal with that problem (dont ask me why, I have issues facing my problems), so I kind of threw the letters under the drawer and never thought of it. It messed up my credit, but I never really used my credit access over the past few years so that never really bothered me. The paper value of the loan is ~42k, which presumably includes default fees.



​
Until this month. My $1,800 federal tax return was fully garnished by the federal government. Also, they sent me a letter this Friday saying they will start garnishing 15% of my paycheck unless I can prove financial hardship. I have 7 days to respond and ask for a hearing, or they will contact my employer and garnish 15% (which is a HORRIBLE look at the workplace). Now - I really don't think I will be able to prove hardship.

​
Now, luckily there seems to be a temporary out. In the letter is says if I have been employed for less than a year AND have been let go by my former employer, I can ask them to not garnish my check (presumably until its 12 months from my employment). Luckily that is the case - I was laid off last October and my new gig started in early March.



​
My plan is to use that out to defer my garnishment. But I also want to deal with this problem now. Does anyone have any suggestions how I can ""negotiate"" with the federal government and start some sort of a payment plan? Is that possible? I am willing to start paying now If I can defer garnishment. Also, the $42k figure seems hard to audit - is there a way I can request all of my documentation and get a sense for how much is principle vs interest vs default interest vs collection fees? If so, would it make sense to negotiate from the principle amount ? Is there a way if I volunteer to pay x amount, I can negotiate for a lower principle ? Has anyone here had experience with negotiating with the federal student loan dept?

I have budgeted an extra $2000 per month that I would like to put towards paying down my mortgage in addition to the normal monthly payments and would like some help understanding what would be the best course of action.

Loan #2 was purchased by my wife and I together and is our primary home. I understand the benefits and differences between snowball vs. avalanche method, but I guess I am looking for a little help and advice beyond that and if anyone can see something I may have missed. I tried using amortization calculators to determine total cost for each method, but all of the calculators I was able to find don't account for large bulk payments to the loan. Only, continuous overpayments from the beginning of the loan. Maybe if someone could help me figure out that math so I can compare the total cost of both methods would be helpful. Thanks!",finance

&gt; “If the impact of the tariffs - and whatever financial market reaction to those tariffs is - causes more of a slowdown, then we do have the tools available to us, including lower interest rates,” Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren, a voter this year on Fed rate policy, said in an interview with Reuters.

Banking,"Weird shit just happened in my bank account? Haven't lost money, but confused.","Hey I never really use Reddit so I hope I'm doing this right. So about 3 days ago or so I was checking my online balance (I use US Bank and have begun to log in far more frequently after they updated+fixed the broken app) and noticed something super weird about my stats for the month of April. I'm just a kid, and I work a minimum-wage job, so I usually don't fill up my account very much, for obvious reasons. Still, the app's graph said that my cash inflow was $6,668.50, and money out was $5,570.78. The graph for April totally dwarfed the graph for March, which looked normal for the kind of stuff I was doing (depositing paychecks between $300-$600 and spending money on dumb bullshit). When I checked my estatement that came May 9th, it said that $5,000 had been transferred from my account, the origin being marked ""Online Banking Advance."" I'm seriously just a kid, and have no idea what that means, so I'm sorry if I'm being stupid here and there's an obvious explanation. I think it's also important to note that $5,000 is the max amount of money USBank lets you deposit at once. Since it seems like $5,000 passed in and out of my account, without me losing any money (the extra cash alongside the $5,000 from my account was from my paychecks) it confused me. If someone had unauthorized access to my account, why wouldn't they take money? The only explanation I could think of is that my account is being used as a proxy for some kind of illicit activity someone doesn't want well-tracked, but I feel like that's a stretch. I hate calling my bank, but I am willing to do so. Any ideas? Any better subreddits for this issue y'all could link me to? Thanks.",finance
personalfinance,How I am budgeting and paying off 88k debt,"I thought I would make a post about my financial situation in an effort to help others. Also, if someone has suggestions for my personal finances, let me know.

I have no CC debt, only student loans. In May 2018 (when I graduated) I had a little over 88k, probably closer to 89. It took me until August to find a job and relocate to a new city, get a new apartment, furniture, etc. by the time my grace period was over was when I was finally able to make payments on my debt. Then in January, my car took a dump. I got a great deal from a family friend but my payments are higher than I’d like. It’s about $290 and I don’t count insurance because I just pay it all in lump sum. 

My take home Pay after taxes is about 1800 every two weeks. Here’s how I budget: I use direct deposit to put a certain percentage into my savings. This amount covers rent, gym membership, Internet bill, minimum payments on federal and private student loans plus ~500 in savings per month. I had depleted my savings while unemployed and relocating, so it took me some time to get my 3-6 month emergency fund. I’m at about 4 but would like 6! 

Then, I have the amount for my car go into a separate bank account, with auto debit. I never even see the car payment, in or out.

For my bills, I put internet and gym on a credit card and have an auto payment from my savings account. Same with the rest of my bills, they’re all auto payment from my savings. This way I never have to keep up with due dates and making sure my money is there. It’s stress free! 

I then budget out ~200 every payday and whatever is left in my checking goes to groceries and then my loans. I’m using the avalanche method to save the most money! I throw about $200-250 extra every payday. I use that leftover ~200 to spend for the next two weeks. Restaurants, fun nights out with friends, movies, whatever. It’s $200 of “fun” money. 

Since November (my first loan payment) I have closed 3 student loans in full and my total debt is now down to 79k! Considering interest is ~350 a month, that’s pretty good(in my opinion).

Hope this helps anyone who struggles to budget and keep track of their spending. Just budget out a pocket of “spending money!” Honestly, it’s very stress free not to have to worry about having the money in my checking account, and student loans will reduce interest .25% with auto payments!",finance

personalfinance,Federal Perkins loan showed up again after 15 years. Paid in full but still showing on credit report.,"I received notice that my loan would be transferred from ECSI to US Department of Education. I then received a notice from the USDE saying that we need to satisfy some kind of loan arrangement or they will report the debt to credit reporting agencies. I paid the amount in full (NO settlements) after confirming with the USDE that the trade line would be removed following this action.

Fast forward a month later, and I now have a trade line on my credit report from the original loan servicer (ECSI) saying that, while the account is paid in full, I have a missed payment. My credit score dropped about 60 points.

I have done a ton of research and learned that satisfying the debt in full ensures the trade line will be removed.

I wanted to consolidate, but 1 company told me my credit score is too low.
Another company said they only consolidate on totals of 8 K or more.
So I guess I am left with the option of the debt snowball?
If I do that, would I be better off to budget X amount of dollars monthly toward debt and keep it the same AND put a little in savings?

So saving it for an emergency to me would do me no good since I  am driven to and would prefer to eliminate my debt quickly before the end of this year. I have learned my lesson about being in debt and hate it.

PayPal Credit: \~1500 @26% APR

and CareCredit: \~1080 @14% APR

The other two are low balance and low interest, and no interest for 18 mos.

&amp;#x200B;

The 0% interest on the majority of my PayPal credit purchases is coming to an end after this month, and it looks like I've been charged interest on my CareCredit.. I was paying the minimum on both because I was paying off other debt and am finished with those before the 0% interest promo expired(their interest rates were deadly; Discount Tire and Affirm).

&amp;#x200B;

Should I go ahead and eliminate the CareCredit with my bonus and/or reimbursement first, or should both go towards PayPal? My bonus won't come in until mid July too btw. I'm not considering a balance transfer because thats what I did last time and got nowhere. Would a settlement on the CareCredit or PayPal be an option? I don't plan on taking any more loans or credit cards until I finish school in the next 2-3 years so I'm not worried about my credit score taking a dip from \~745.

personalfinance,I need to buy a car for my internship,"Hello, I’m a 22 year old college student in Virginia. I secured a paid internship that’s an invaluable opportunity which requires that I have a reliable form of transportation. I currently have a car which is on its last leg so it doesn’t necessarily qualify as a ‘reliable’ form of transportation. I also recently secured a part-time job at a VAABC store worth $10.71 hourly at 20-25 hours weekly. I also plan to use the car for food delivery and/ or uber/lyft to make extra cash on the side.

My objective is to finance a used car worth $5,000-6,000 and I estimate I’ll need to have it in roughly two weeks. My credit score is 575 (I don’t have any credit cards, just regular bills and student loans which I have not made any payments on yet). As it stands, my mother offered to help by suggesting she use a credit card with a limit of $5,000 and 0% apr for a certain period of time (I’m not sure about the details) to buy the car up front and I’ll pay the monthly payments. I’m reluctant because the last thing I want to do is get my family any closer to financial disparity as, due to several factors, the family isn’t completely safe from such a fate. My brother (who is more financially savvy) says that this is a feasible option for me considering that if I were to finance the car through conventional avenues, my interest rate and subsequently my payments will be unreasonably high. 

My questions are: Is an idea like this really feasible and sound? Is this a high risk against my mother’s credit? Are there any alternatives I should consider?

To be completely honest, I’m a little lost here so there might be other questions that I should be asking or other information I should have that could be useful, so feel free to ask for additional information to build a better basis for an opinion or suggest points for research.

TL;DR: 22 y/o college student needs cheap car within 2 weeks ($5-6k); credit score: 575 (no credit cards); working part-time $10.71/hr; mother offered to put car on credit card with 5k limit and 0% apr for unknown period of time while I make the payments; dealer/ bank financing most likely unfeasible due to financial status; I don’t want to risk my family’s financial wellbeing and I think this internship will be critical to my future.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions

The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

personalfinance,List of Australian Savings Accounts and Interest Rates,"Fellow Australians,

I have had a fair amount of time in between uni courses recently and have been keen to get in and procrastinate as much as possible so I have compiled a list of all of the savings accounts and interest rates from the vast majority of Australia's Banks (the ""vast majority"" being the ones listed on wikipedia) . I realise there are websites available that present this data already, however I have found most are sponsored by one bank or another to leave out features from their competitors. My data has comes straight from the horse's mouth however I have chosen to leave out any introductory interest rates because I feel they are just a marketing technique to show certain accounts higher than others when you sort by ""*interest rate: high-low"".*

I have also excluded cases which require you also take out a loan or super fund with the same organisation as I felt that was more of a separate case altogether. The same goes for estate planning and pension accounts. I did not include management fees or ATM fees as I found the accounts, although all savings accounts, had different uses across the board. I found the accounts with lower interest rates had no fees for convenience whereas the accounts with the higher interest rates had significant withdrawal fees (sometimes upwards of $5!) to encourage saving.

My list would have doubled in size if I included credit unions so I have left them out also (for now). Feel free to talk shit in the comments and point out my mistakes.

personalfinance,Paying student loans while still in school?,"I am still in school, but my school has a co-op program so I am currently working full time. I am saving up a good chunk of my income, contributing a little to an IRA, and paying for housing, groceries, etc. I do, however, have 2 relatively small student loans. One of my loans is subsidized, so it is not generating any interest -- my other loan is not, and it has a 4.45% interest rate.

Throughout my time in school, I have been paying a small amount every few weeks towards the unsubsidized loan in order to keep the interest down, but now that I am working full time, I have started to pay more. I have paid about half of the principle of the unsubsidized loan, and I currently have enough money saved up to comfortably pay the rest. Is there anything wrong with paying back that student loan now? Is there any reason for me to wait? Should I pay most of it and keep $10 of the principle unpaid (someone suggested I do this to keep my credit score good? I don't understand that.). Any advice much appreciated :)",finance

personalfinance,When do you switch from debt reduction to taxable investment accounts?,"I could really use some advice on if it is a smart thing to prioritize taxable investment over debt reduction.  

Husband and I both max out 401k's, IRA's, and HSA's. We also contribute to a 529 for kids college. We have $23k extra in cash right now.  No current cash flow concerns, but we have a solid e-fund.

&amp;#x200B;

**Originally:**

Originally that money was going to remove our PMI. When we purchased a home in December 2018 rates were cheaper to put less than 20% down and then pay $500 to have PMI removed with a lump sum. (PMI is only $40) However, when talking to our lender they sent an offer for refinance since rates are now lower than they were in december. Drop 0.375% to 4%, with lender credit that will cover all but \~800 of the closing costs. Appriasal was waived and they came up with a higher value for the house which means PMI will be knocked off without needing extra cash. Refinancing without that $23k will cost $800 (+/- depending on which day we close and how much prepaid interest) and escrow will just directly transfer over since it is with our current lender. With just doing this we will save $75 on the PI, and $40 on the PMI. Resets the term, but we have only been paying since Feb 2019. Putting that $23k into the house no longer makes as much sense as we do not need to remove the PMI. If we do a lump sum at closing or a few months after with a recast, that results in \~$100 less per month.

However... now we are thinking that is not the optimal use of the cash. We could put the money into a taxable account, or use it to pay off other debts.

&amp;#x200B;

**Debts:**

Student Loan #1: $22k @ 2.75% ($620/month, 3yr 3month left)

Student Loan #2: $39k @ 2.725% ($1047/month 3yr 3 month left)

Car #1: $5k @ 0% ($440/month, 8 months left)

Car #2: $24k @ 2.9% ($430/month, new loan: 5 years left)

I have a hard time justifying paying off one of these debts since they are all such low interest rates and cash flow is not a concern. It would literally be only for a feel good thing- and it would indeed feel good to knock out a student loan.

**Am I off my rocker to put this money into some taxable investments**\- especially with all the current volitality? It would be for an unknown horizon. Maybe need for daughers college in 16 years, or her wedding *much* later than that, or get relocated and want to spend more on a home, or maybe a vacation home once student loans are done, or just keep going until retirement. We do not even know yet- and it will really depend on our needs along the way.",finance

Further escalation is likely imo.,"&gt; The U.S. Trade Representative’s office Monday released a list of about $300 billion worth of Chinese goods including children’s clothing, toys, mobile phones and laptops that Trump has threatened to hit with a 25% tariff. If Trump proceeds with the tariffs, it would see almost all imports from China covered by punitive import duties.

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-05-14/u-s-readies-new-tariffs-as-trump-says-he-ll-meet-china-s-xi-jvn5hw67

From what I’ve read so far it looks like Xi and the standing committee genuinely believed the Trump Administration would capitulate in the 11th hour even if they rewrote key terms of the deal, as past administrations did when similar tactics were used. That appears to have been a massive miscalculation, [Lighthizer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Lighthizer) has literally been preparing for a showdown with China his whole career, he probably knows the inner workings (and pressure points) of China’s political and economic system better than many in the [politburo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politburo_of_the_Communist_Party_of_China). He’s said for a long time the US is done letting China get away with not following its WTO obligations, its literally been 20 years. Rampant IP theft, non tariff barriers and unfair subsidies have been used by China for decades and everyone tolerated it until recently, even those who don’t support Trumps tactics agree China needs to reform some of the predatory parts of its economic system if it wants continued free access to global markets (which it’s very dependent on), something it denies other countries within its borders. 

The real challenge for the CCP is the deterioration of relations with the US is coming at a point where the economy is extremely vulnerable as it try’s to transition from its current unsustainable debt heavy, high growth model to one based on consumption (like America). Back in 08 the CCP launched a larger stimulus plan than TARP to keep chinas economy from collapsing, it worked. The unfortunate byproduct of near constant stimulus since then has lead to massive pockets of dead or unproductive capital within China’s financial system (like ghost cities). Because the system is so opaque it’s impossible to get an accurate read on how bad things are under the hood. China’s state owned enterprises have become bloated and inefficient behemoths that are addicted to debt and eat up stimulus capital at the expense of China’s much more efficient private sector (which also responsible for most of China’s new employment growth). 

The CCP badly needs to reform the current system if it wants to avoid long term stagnation, like japan, or a total collapse within the system. They’ve exhausted the tools needed to bail the economy out, [debt to GDP is upward of 300%](https://www.bloomberg.com/quicktake/chinas-debt-bomb) but even more frightening to me is the Chinese state is on the hook for [trillions in USD denominated debt](https://www.google.ca/amp/s/amp.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/2173461/china-underestimating-its-us3-trillion-dollar-debt-and-could) that needs to be serviced as US interest rates rise. At the same time it’s [current account surplus is evaporating](https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Comment/The-vanishing-illusion-of-China-s-financial-might) which could lead to a shortage of USD within China, thats potentially a massive problem. 

If investment is state directed you can target any GDP figure because an empty city still counts toward GDP growth even though it created no sustainable economic activity. Right now China spends $3.5 in debt to generate $1 of GDP, before 2008 it was under a $1 spent per $1 of GDP. The constant stimulus means they’ve mostly exhausted their economic tool box. Now time to reform.... 

In order to continue thriving the economy has to go through some painful reforms in the short term, This is where China is caught between a rock and a hard place. 

Even under the most ideal circumstances China was never going to stay above 8% GDP growth indefinitely. US demands for reform would actually be beneficial for China long term, it would help correct many of the structural issues that it’s house of cards economy is built off of. Only challenge being is the reforms mean that the communist party would have to relinquish control over some key areas that help it maintain its grip on power.

personalfinance,Student Loan Repayment Question,"TL;DR:  Finished school. Made debt. Tried getting it paid over time by the military. That failed due to my own shortcomings. I owed 12k but now the debt collector said I owe 16k. What are my options? Can I negotiate? Is it all interest from prior or did the debt collectors tack on fees?

Thanks for any advice!

MORE INFO BELOW IF NEEDED!!!!

About 8 years ago I finished college. Racked up about 12 grand in debt afterwards after all was done. I am in the military (they only paid a certain amount). I thought I had it in forbearance but I guess I didn’t recently (had SLRP: Student Loan Repayment Program through military). Since the forbearance didn’t go through it went into default. My SLRP doesn’t pay default loans. It just so happens I also got a federal job around the same time. As a federal employee technician (dual status I wear the uniform but it’s also a civilian job) I cannot have bonus’ or SLRP. So it went away even if I wanted to get out of default I couldn’t use SLRP. So I tried to pay my loans which I thought would be around 12k or maybe some more. The debt collection agency said I owe 16k. Is that interest from the loans originally? I mean there were a couple years it wasn’t in forbearance and I was paying small amounts.  So I know interest accrued. I am wondering how to go about asking the debt collection if they will reduce the amount if I pay in full? I wish I would have done this in the beginning instead of being greedy and trying to have the military pay it off for me over time.",finance

personalfinance,Paying off Car Loan vs Maxing Out 401k,"So I currently have a car loan for \~$12,000 with an interest rate of 3.19% and minimum payments of $380. At this moment I'm paying $500/month on it in order to pay it off early and minimize interest over the life of the loan.

&amp;#x200B;

I make about 77k/year and am currently contributing 15% to my 401k and maxing out my HSA, and have landed at a spot where everything remains pretty steady month to month (between rent, car payments, misc expenses, etc.).

&amp;#x200B;

I'm moving to a new apartment which will save me an estimated $200/month and am debating how to allocate that extra money. My thought is that I can take the $200 from rent and the $120 that I'm currently overpaying on the car loan and it will almost exactly get me to the maximum 401k contribution **OR** I could just pay off the loan faster and be interest free.

&amp;#x200B;

Now the question really becomes a matter of expected near-term returns in my 401k investments (a target date vanguard fund) vs my 3.19% car loan. It seems to me that trying to predict where the stock market will go is impossible in most cases, but for some reason I have a gut feeling that 3.19% will beat the market over the time it would take me to pay off the rest of the loan.

Between dropping the kids off at daycare and going to work, I drive about 46 miles round-trip a day. It's been a great car, but now that we have two kids we were talking about getting something a little larger and more family-friendly. We will probably get about $5500 for the car.

My husband commutes to work (about 70 mi roundtrip, 5x week) and drives a 4-door F-150. We are 47 months into a 60 month loan at $561/mo. The plan was to wait until his truck was paid off to get a larger vehicle for me, but now that plan has been f\*\*\*ed. *(Thanks, college-student-who-was-texting-and-driving!)* Luckily, my kids weren't in the car and neither party was hurt.

The tricky part is, my son doesn't start pre-K until September, so until then we are paying daycare cost for two at $377/week. In the fall, this bill should drop to about $200/week for a year, and then hopefully stay under $200/week until my baby reaches pre-K in 2022.

**Here are the options I've been weighing –**

1. **Drive my husband's truck, and purchase a ($8K or less) commuter vehicle for him with the insurance payment.** Once his truck is paid off in June 2020, we would maybe trade this vehicle in for a van or mid-size SUV. Or, maybe I'll like driving the truck and we'll just stick with what we have.
2. **Buy a van or mid-size SUV ($18K or less) with $4K down, and using the remainder of the insurance money to offset about a month of daycare cost this summer when the expenses will be the most**. Once my son starts pre-K this fall, we can reallocate what we've been spending on his tuition toward the car payment. After a year we can allocate what we've been paying on the truck to the new vehicle.

The concern with option 1, is that if we do decide to trade the car in for a van, we will have to pay the closing costs of purchasing a vehicle all over again (tag, tax, etc.) However, putting him in a commuter car now would save fuel costs and keep us from another big car payment.

I'm not keen on driving the truck because it's a PITA to park, but I'm sure I'd get used to it. Also, in a few years I'm sure I'll be picking up my kid's friends from school, too so a van or mid-size SUV could better accommodate that. 

Perhaps there is another option I am overlooking or something to consider that I haven't. This isn't solely a financial decision as I am thinking my family's safety and comfort over the long term as well. So, if we buy a van/SUV we want something we can hang on to for 10 years or more, and not something that's already broken 100K in miles. Thank you for reading this and I appreciate any advice!

solar,Does anyone have real photos of an LG320N1K-A5 Panel and/or thoughts?,"Hi Guys, I'm wrapping up discussions for a solar install, likely a larger 34 panel config vs a smaller 26 panel, based on some advice I got from an earlier post.

personalfinance,Nelnets Auto Debit may actually be costing you money,"Nelnet provides a 0.05% interest rate discount for using their auto debit function (apparently this may be different for everyone depending on when you signed up). However, it does not allow you to designate where the auto debit goes and has been paying down the group with the lowest interest and small remaining principal balance. 

This may be costing you in the long run depending on your balances and interest rates.

For my personal situation, its paying 80% of the payment to a group with 3.15% and $1100. It is then dividing the other 20% to 2 groups with 3.35% and 5.65% with almost $2500 remaining in each. 

Clearly, this is would cost me in the long run. I would advise you to check your extended monthly loan statement to see where your payment is being applied if you use this function through Nelnet.",finance

personalfinance,"Have lots of debt, don’t know what to do","Hi, I know i’m stupid and that i shouldn’t have done this and there is no excuse for it but i don’t really know what to do. I’m still in school. I go to an out of state college because i had to get away from my family desperately. I did it in the most expensive way possible and the only option i had in front of me besides suicide. 


(basically the reason i needed to get away from them was that they are very religious to the point where they would threaten to kill me if i disobeyed god or them. we moved to america when were young originally from a country in africa. growing up it was very abusive mentally and physically combined with religious stuff. in 6th grade my dad took my entire family over seas in order for us to learn about our culture and language more, turns out it was just an excuse for him to move us closer to his second wife who we didn’t know abt. anyways he took us back to our home country and literally basically “showed me and my sister off” to his male family members so they could decide who would marry us, my family revolves around forced arranged marriages and complying to the men and i couldn’t stand it. i was so scared growing up, i knew so many cousins who were tied and forced to get married to second cousins. i didn’t want this, my family never showed me love growing up and it was all about religion and pleasing god, and i couldn’t stand it)

so i lied and told them i got a scholarship to an out of state school, which took me 6 months of begging to let me go to college. but it worked. basically i don’t have a scholarship i have been taken out loans to pay for school and it’s around $60k and i have two years left.  (i’m studying engineering so i might have a decent income when i graduate but i’m scared i’m not gonna find a job because i don’t know how to socialize or network or meet people due to horrible traumas+mental health from childhood) i know none of this is an excuse, i just don’t know what to do i’m so scared, to the point im contemplating suicide bc i won’t be able to pay this off. i have a job now but i don’t make much and most of the money i give my family because we are very poor. 

*the loans are ALL federal
*getting around 10k a year in financial aid (i apply for fafsa)
*i have one scholarship but it’s around 2k 
*yes i’m on work study during the school year and full time during summers and winter and spring break. (10/hr)
*the loans should total up to $90k by the time i graduate its around 60 atm


i’m really not looking for sympathy i’m sorry if i’m coming off that way, just looking for a sort of direction. I don’t know many people in america, growing up it was basically a box. so college is very new and different to me and I’m scared of ask for help, (I don’t have anyone to ask anyways)

Any tips will be appreciated! i already know I fucked up. Thank you so much for reading.

personalfinance,"Settled defaulted Federal School loan for $29,129.87 compromise with Federal collections agency representing Dept of Ed. Dept of Ed reporting settlement as $26,817.58. What happened to the other $2,300? Help!","So I had $33,042.62 in Federal School loans go into default and assigned to a collections agency representing the Department of Education in January. The Collections Agency was Central Portfolio Control, acting on behalf of the Professional Bureau of Collections of Maryland, acting on behalf of the Department of Education.

My school loans immediately jumped up from $33,042.60 to $40,329.38, presumably to penalties and such. I made sure to match account numbers with the collections agency, and called the Dept of Ed to confirm that my total debt was now $40,329.38, which they did confirm. The Dept of Ed refused to talk to me about the defaulted loan itself, and instead shuffled me to Central Portfolio Control, as they were the collections agency representing them.

After contacting CPC, they drew up and sent me a compromise letter, saying that payment of $29,129.87 would be accepted as full settlement and satisfaction of my defaulted loan. After several more phone calls with the agency and Dept of Ed, and a couple more compromise letters (by April my total amount had accrued to about $40,700, but they kept the settlement offer the same) I was eventually able to pull together the cash by the end of April, and sent in a check payable to the Department of Education with my account number written in the memo.

A weekish later, I received a written notification from the Department of Education that ""serves as written verification that the U.S. Department of Education (Department) has agreed to a settlement of your defaulted student loan(s) and/or grant overpayment(s) in the amount of $26,817.58.""

Wondering wtf happened to my ~$2,300, I called the Dept of Ed, and they couldn't give me a straight answer. They basically said that the collection agency has their own settlement amount, and the dept of Ed has theirs, but couldn't explain why there was a difference, or why I wasn't notified of this, or what it meant, despite my numerous phone calls with both the Dept of Ed and collections agency.

**Why I am ultimately so concerned is that it is my understanding that when you settle a debt, the difference between the settlement amount and the total debt usually gets reported to the IRS in the form of a 1099-C form, and that difference gets added to me as taxable income.**

The Dept of Ed wouldn't comment on taxes, and couldn't give me any verification of what might get reported. They just said that from their end the compromise has settled the account and zero'd it out, and recommended I speak to CPC (haven't been able to contact them yet).

Wtf is going on? Am I going to be on the hook for the difference between $26,817.58 and the ~$41,000 total, or will the collections agency report the full settlement I gave them and I'll ""only"" be on the hook for the difference between the $29,129.87 and ~$41,000 total? Is the ~$2,300 difference their cut?

Wtf is going on here? Can anyone help me understand. I am trying to withhold more taxes from my paycheck to help prepare for next year, but I don't know what to expect now.

personalfinance,Need help understanding how insolvency works (or advice on who to contact),"I recently settled a large federal school loan debt with a compromise, and the collection agency plans on filing a 1099 C form, which will likely add the difference between the settlement and the loan total to my federal income to be taxed. In order to avoid this, i am looking at exploring insolvency.

I am looking into insolvency, and I think I understand the basic concept (debts need to outweigh assets), but I have a few key questions.

A) Does insolvency count directly before I paid the compromise to cancel the debt, or directly afterwards? In other words, do I include the original debt as counting towards my insolvency? Do I count the original debt as a liability and the money I paid to settle it as an asset? Do I not count it at all?

B) Do I count debt to a family member (it is easily provable through records)? An Aunt lent me $12,000 for a car, of which I am repaying with a set amount every month, and to the date of the debt cancellation, still owed about 10k. Do I count this 10k toward my debt even though the car I own is technically paid off?

C) How do I actually balance liabilities vs assets? I've looked for some worksheets and they seem kind of vague.

Is it as simple as ""add together all bank accounts and value of property at the time of the cancelled debt versus the total of liabilities""? So my car would be an asset, but my loan I owe my aunt would be a liability?

Am I literally counting every piece of clothing and silverware I might own? And how do I do that? The ""big"" stuff like the old TV and PS4 make sense, but how finite am I getting. Does rent count?

And if Reddit can't help, who can I turn too? An accountant? a lawyer? What type of lawyer if so? I'm totally lost and would prefer not to spend hundreds of dollars searching aimlessly through different services trying to find the right help.

personalfinance,Refinance Parent PLUS loan under my name with lower interest or keep paying under my parents name,"My dad got a Parent PLUS loan for me while I was in undergrad and I’ve been consistently paying it off along with my own federal / private loans.

Since I pay for it anyways, I’m wondering if it will be beneficial for me to refinance the loan under my name with lower interest. This would double the total debt tied to my credit report and I’m concerned whether this is worse off than eating the higher interest, especially if I ever want to apply for a mortgage or something. My dad is okay with whatever decision I chose. FWIW - I only have student debt and a car loan thats paid off at the end of the year.

Current status:
- Total compensation - $126k base + ~$50k bonus
- Total debt under my name - $47k
- $30k Direct Consolidation @ 4.75%
- $16k SoFi Refinance @ 5.25%
- $1k Chase auto finance @ 3.25%

Not under my name
- $45k Parent PLUS Loan @ 6.795%

If I refinance, the interest rate will be 4.375% with 15yr term instead of ~19yr remaining on the current loan with the same monthly payment. However, I would have a total debt load of $97k, almost doubling my DTI.

personalfinance,Friend needs help; he is attempting to cut off all financial ties from his parents and live off of federal graduate school loans.,"My friend (let's say John) is not a redditor but I suggested posting his story to r/personalfinance for advice before making any drastic moves. A little bit of background information: John is a recent college graduate who will be attending a prestigious private university to earn his Master's degree. He has dealt with an upbringing filled with physical and verbal abuse at home and he graduated from his undergraduate school with minimal financial assistance from his parents who make a combined income of over $250,000 annually. His older sibling 'Jordan' (who is currently attending graduate school as well) has graduated from a less prestigious undergraduate institution and is enrolled in a less prestigious graduate program but continues to receive substantially greater financial assistance from their parents for no apparent reason. Both parents are very frugal with their money but what little they do spend is spent on Jordan; a truth that has also been identified and admitted by Jordan.

John is beginning a position this summer under the head of his graduate school's department and requires a laptop to run the necessary software for the position (his old laptop was supplied by his parents and was a 2007 model that stopped working on its own mid-semester this spring). His parents, who never gift him with anything on any occcassion, refuse to assist him in buying a laptop despite his recent graduation and the fact that it is imperative he has one for his job and for graduate school. They justify their decision by saying he can ""work harder to pay for it on his own"" despite the fact that he currently survives on under $20 per week after paying for gas and rent. They are adamant he continue his education and will likely look down upon him if he does not continue on and get a PhD but also refuse to assist him.
Years of verbal and physical abuse in addition to this have led him to a breaking point where he is exploring his options to become completely financially independent.

At his graduate school, he will be receiving the Federal Student Loan Plus (the cost of attendance determined by the school) which will cover his housing and tuition costs. He is planning to get a part time job to cover his phone bill and other living expenses but the major obstacle at the moment is how he will pull this off without his name on the title of his car as his dad may cut off his insurance policy. I mentioned that he may be able to find a car within the $2-3000 range and start an insurance policy on it but he is still unsure what he should do about the car situation. 

Additionally, he has very little savings and is surviving paycheck to paycheck. Any advice on how to handle this situation would be greatly appreciated; he has already brought up how unfair this situation is to his parents who have shown no sympathy and believe he is being greedy.

Edit: His loans will total around $130,000 as it is a two year program at around $65,000 per year to cover tuition and living expenses. The average entry level salary in his profession is $110,000 per year according to payscale.com and he is almost guaranteed to have a position after graduation.

Finally am fed up and buy out my contract and gtfo. I pay the remaining balance on my bill and the contract. I paid close to $300, (70/220 bill to contract.) 


I have had issues with phone companies in the past. So once the payment had been recieved and my acct. cleared, I asked, ""So after I hang up the phone and we are done. Will I have any outstanding balances or charges on my acct??"".


""No, you will have nothing left tagged to your acct.""

Phone bill - $117

Gas - $60 (I don't drive much)

Food - $250

Personal items, clothes, etc. etc. - $150

Savings for emergency - $300

Petty cash - About $100 usually

Is this a good budget? I don't pay rent to live with my mom and step-dad, I just pay the cable and internet. I plan on working at my current job until I finish my associates, then getting a job in-state until a better opportunity is made.

Any suggestions would be awesome, I am new to the workforce and paying bills. I am not too familiar with budgetizing!

personalfinance,Going government or staying contractor,"My apologies if this isnt the right place for this but in my opinion this comes down to a financial decision. I have recently been offered the opportunity to become a government employee working in the field of cyber security in DC making 83k a year with an opportunity to be making 99k in the government within the next 2 years (GS12-GS13 jump after completing the selected program). 

My currently job as a contractor has me making 70k with a raise to 80k July 1st then another raise to 90k January 1st. There will also be a contract recompete September of 2020 that I have a potential raise to the 110k mark. I have good benefits that include health care, dental, vision, as well as a 6% match into my 401k. My company also give me 15 days vacation, 6 sick days, 6 federal holidays and pays me out at the end of the year for all my overtime (currently at 70hr overtime this year). I really like the people that I currently work with and I am afraid of going into the government and dealing with a ton of lazy people who push their work off on to others. 

I want to ask what this sub thought about these options as I have had an extremely hard deciding if I want to take it or not. On one hand going into the government will mean more money in the short term and great stability but I dont want to cut myself short. Would anyone in this sub be able to give me a better financial breakdown to help me make this decision? I have had a difficult time coming up with a dollar value of the (so called great) government bennefits, so any breakdown would be much appreciated.

I cannot afford to buy a new house without selling this one because of how expensive the monthly payment is vs how much I would make on rent (just about breaks even). However....refinancing the mortgage at 4% would lower the payment significantly and allow me to be able to keep the place and rent it out making $700/month. Is this a bad idea?

personalfinance,Should I temporarily move back in with parents to pay down debts? 32F MA,"I need advice on my next moves, but there are almost too many options and combinations for me to figure out where I should go next.

Option 1: Stay living on my own locally and keep doing what I'm doing

Option 2: Move in with parents to save money

Option 3: Move somewhere cheaper and start life over there

With all of this, I want to pursue my master's degree with tuition reimbursement from my company - either in person or online.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 32F living alone in the expensive greater Boston area. Just got out of a long-term relationship, and since then have changed my life and finances. Previously I paid all of my bills on time while living paycheck to paycheck.  I'm now very frugal, refinanced two student loans, canceled many monthly expenses, and live cheaply in comparison.

&amp;#x200B;

I was told today that I'm being made into a remote employee for my company, so I won't have to live near the office. This means I can move anywhere, and out of the Greater Boston rental market, which is very expensive. But here is a breakdown of my finances.

&amp;#x200B;

**Cash Savings:** $1300

**Emergency Fund:** $15,000  (only for future down payment, kept with parents) 

**Income**:

\~3702.66 monthly, with two triple paycheck months. Estimated $3K bonus each November.

\- $1481.06 (80%) to checking for bill payment

\- $135.62 for medical expenses (FSA contribution, Vision, Health, Dental)

Post-tax deductions:

\- $29.18 to 401K Roth

\- $23.38 pet insurance for doggo

\- $8.24 supplemental life insurance

* $100 gas
* $150 misc. (haircut, unexpected costs)

&amp;#x200B;

Questions:

\- should I move back home to my parents, which will save me $1500/mo.

\-  If I move home, I can pay off the low balance student loans immediately along with my car. That will openup \~$616/mo. that I can then put towards the next highest percentage loan.

\- If I stay where I am, I can only save $240/mo. while paying loan minimums

personalfinance,About to get terminated from my retail job by Saturday evening,"**Monetary status:**
I have $400 on hand, a credit card with a $500 limit with a $400 balance and am getting paid later today which should approximately be $800-$900. Could be a little more, but just an estimate until I see it. 


Maybe some of this money will need to be spent on legal representation if I claim unemployment compensation and the company fights it. I don't think I'd be comfortable going it alone though an unemployment arbitration hearing. I'm thinking about contacting a friend's dad/lawyer whom I get along with to inquire about rates. If I get fired, I don't plan to sign anything else which my current employer places in front of me. I might even write a brief statement on the back of such a document unless that's ill advised.



**With this info, I seek recommendations on how to proceed.** I don't have to pay rent at the moment and I have some help with food. I may need to spend $200 on my bicycle in the next two months on parts but it is currently in good shape and well lubricated and maintained. I also have spare brake pads, tires and tubes so I'm kind-of covered when it comes to consumables.

&amp;nbsp;


I feel highly exploited because if my manager has had ground to terminate me for more than a couple of weeks, I've  been getting heavily worked, and strung along. Basically, I'm having the general perception that I'm being deceived just to keep me working a little longer until I am no longer needed because of newly hired team members.



At the end of last week I greeted the GM as she walked by and she said nothing but nodded. Her expression seemed to indicate something which needed to remain unsaid. Like she knew my time was coming to an end, couldn't say anything but knew. When she first took this store in October, the GM shook things up, brought in some of her people but over all improved things. I've worked with her in the past and **this GM is tough but fair. My qualm is not with her, but with my immediate manager.** She can be so fake so often, she also just annoys me and teases me in ways that would comical if she wasn't so adversarial when dishing out write-ups. I've signed all but one write-up from all of my past managers because I've earned them. I never took it personally more than twice and even then after some time ""decompressing"" it blew over and I was given a fair chance to do my job.


This time, this manager... I get hot-cold form her. When my sales were good,  I didn't see the negative but I was suspicious of her. Once my sales tanked, she turned.  **The background story below will show how and is provided in order to determine if I have a case for unemployment.** 


**Background story:**
I was going to buy an astronomy camera for $370 to $1200, but I think (j/k, DEFINITELY) I will defer that purchase until a better time. It's not like I don't already have an SLR and and an auto-guider. I'll be able to image planets and some nebulae with the free time I may have between jobs. Hopefully not too much free time.

First I'd like to share a little background, but I'll keep it succinct. I hope don't sound too one-sided here. I got a new manager in November, but I unknowingly met her a week before it was official. She came in as a secret shopper, and when I learned this it set off alarm bells. Putting myself in her shoes, I can respect wanting to see your future team in their natural element but being in my shoes I'm still entitled to being suspicious of things to come.


I proceeded to do my job normally, but somehow went from having the worst sales numbers month after month to having the top sales numbers. It's no joke, I was somehow the best sales performer in all of December. I attribute this to the time of the year as well as my demeanor. I try to deliver world-class customer service and I use my knowledge to help customers feel confident about spending money on our services. Of course, this did not last once January started -- it was ""Returns Season"", when people have a bit more time to bring back the defective and unwanted merchandise which they bought on or after Black Friday.


Eventually it was time to see how my manager would treat me in this paradigm. 

&amp;nbsp;


By the end of January I was in the office being written up. It felt quite personal but I kept my self brief and straight-faced. She would ask, ""how long have you been with the company?"" I offered to count my time from '05 to present but then she was like, ""no, when did you first start?"" Well, it's a tricky answer, I started in '05 but I didn't work for this company from 2009 to 2004. 

So did I work for this company for ten years or fifteen years? Well, she insisted that I worked for fifteen years. That my sales and overall performance shouldn't be what it is because of that. That all of the problems which she overlooked in December, suddenly seemed to matter overwhelmingly more.


She offered me a ""final"" for my bad sales and overall performance, I think.. she also offered an ""Action Plan"", aka performance improvement plan. I gave it some thought but ultimately concluded that I rather switch departments as this was on of the options offered.

I was instructed to send an e-mail to her and the GM to this effect in order to (unsaid) generate an electronic record of my agreement to this fact. I was scheduled on the sales floor (versus services) on a handful of occasions across two-three weeks then I was back in my own department. We were short staffed, so I was obviously needed there.


During the holidays and then January she asked me, **""do you mind working full-time hours even though you are part-time?""** In the spirit of cooperation, I said sure and only expressed a desire to avoid being scheduled to close late and open early.

&amp;nbsp;

During a subsequent one-on-one a month later (early March) she was all like, ""no big deal.. everyone's numbers are down this month."" Also asked if I minded working in the department, she said ""you know.. I like you anyway.."" which was a turn-around from the heavy and negative tone taken during my last write-up session. Somewhat optimistic, I continued to do my job but failed at selling. It's been a ghost town in this store lately but I guess if others can sell, so should I. 


During a more recent one-on-one for mid April she was like, ""your sales aren't great but just keep at it..."" and suggested strategies and stuff. She also hinted at an opportunity for a promotion of sorts. Basically, I work on the customer service counter where I sue my tech knowledge to sell and I also fix things on the fly. Like, if we fix a computer and during pick-up it turns out that it wasn't' fixed correctly or completely, I make it work. I can go into greater detail but that is in my opinion one of my biggest value-added capabilities. This is part of why past managers have kept me around. I can turn a potentially bad customer experience into a positive one.

&amp;nbsp;


**Chance for Advancement:**

I was offered the opportunity to apply for a promotion from service counter rep to part-time technician. During the one-on-one in which this was mentioned she told me it would involve less hours, **actual part-time hours for a part-timer, sign me up!** The reason from her perspective why this would be good, in her words... my sales numbers were bringing the team averages down. So if others did really well (nobody was doing ""really well"" but I guess doing better - I should print that info out before I get fired) but my numbers were still bad, it would mess up the ranking for our store. 


Well, either way.. the technical role is right up my alley, I was very optimistic about this chance and **it was indicated that I had a good shot at at it.** So I apply, and others applied for other roles of advancement and I wait for my interview, which coincidentally came last.  Right before the interview my manager was doing back-to-back ""coaching forms"" which are a step below an actual ""verbal"" write-up. 


Then during the interview she started with routine questions, skipped a bunch saying ""this we can skip because it don't matter since you're not new"" or something like that. Then she asked me more pointed questions about my past performance in my current role. Uses my answers against me to show how much I suck.


Then finally hits me with, ""for these reasons we cannot move forward with this."" Then proceeds to tell me how I have four days until the end of the fiscal month to turn my numbers around or else I would be put onto an ""Action Plan"" on May 5th. At this point I thought about arguing, but unlike my younger self I knew my logic would not prevail.. her mind was already made up. It was earth shattering, I already felt like I needed to look fro a new job but then after a stressful two day weekend... I'm given a lifeline. 


&amp;nbsp;


At the end of a ten hour hell shift on a Sunday, I am called to the office and thought this would be bad. I was contemplating how I would exit, if I would tell them off of just be professional and say ""I don't need this"" and walk out of the office. Would I bother to argue my own case? Would I play it close to the chest so that I can file for unemployment? I figured they were gonna ask me to sign something and I was determined not to sign it for once.


Instead, I am sitting in front of my manager and a manager of a different service oriented department and cashier. I was given a chance to move from my technical role to a customer service/cashier role. In my head I was jumping for joy, two months earlier I was supposed to be moved to another department and my manager never acted on it. 




During this talk my manager said ""we don't want you to feel like we're pushing you out.."" and I was like, ""no, I understand. My poor sales performance affects the productivity of the team. You've given me opportunities to improve and have invested plenty of time into my development which I appreciate."" Yes, i literally said this even though I feel very negatively about my manager.




So, **we shook on it** and I thought it was a sure thing. Well, aside from the mention of ""as long as you don't get written up for anything else on a final or get in trouble for bad attendance/lateness.""

&amp;nbsp;

**Regarding lateness, I was on a final for lateness last year but the year has expired and that write-up should no longer count. If I was to get written-up for attendance now, I'd have to get a verbal (strike 1), written (strike 2) and final (strike 3) before I could ultimately be terminated.** It seemed I had a near-solid shot at this new role with the cautionary warning about how I could still do something in that role which would get me terminated when combined with recent past write-ups.


&amp;nbsp;


A friend warned me to keep my mouth shut and to be super cautious, that managers in this store have their own agendas and do shady things somewhat often. I heeded her words and realized, this was not a sure thing but was still cautiously optimistic. I should have assumed they'd screw me and jump harder onto the job search. 



About a week and a half ago my manager asked me if I was okay with taking a pay cut, to which I said ""yes"" and she double-checked for elaboration. I sated ""if I am to take on less responsibility, it is only fair that I received a corresponding pay decrease."" **She told me to submit an e-mail to her, the GM and the manager of the department I'm supposedly moving to and for it to state the aforementioned agreement to a pay cut.**


This made more optimistic -- like, why ask this if you're not gonna go ahead?

&amp;nbsp;


**On attendance**, I never call out and my manager acknowledges this. Oddly, this manager has not once written me up for lateness. So between that, and the fact that it has been over a year since my ""final"" (write-up) for lateness/attendance, I don't think I can be terminated over that. To be terminated for lateness, you need to get the three write-ups which include a final. She had not once spoken to me officially about lateness.


She saw fit to schedule me all kinds of extra hours, to satisfy coverage needs. Some weeks I'd work full-time hours, other weeks just shy of full-time. I printed out the past two months of schedules and intend on printing out more schedules from October. I figure if I have to fight for unemployment, it might help support my case.**


&amp;nbsp;


#tl;dr:

**tl;dr:** New manager came in November and seemed tough but I rolled with it. I somehow went from having the worst sales numbers to being the best in the team for about two months. Sales numbers tanked in January and then suddenly, my manager cared about other facets of my performance which she seemed too overlook up to that point. She used it all to give me a loaded write-up, what she termed a ""final"", but I'm not 100% if it is. 


Subsequently, I kept working like a dog... sometimes late but keeping my self within the ten minute ""grace period"". Then in February I was gonna be put onto an ""action plan"" (shape up or ship out in one month) but I was offered a chance to switch departments in and I took it (sent an e-mail as instructed and the mangers responded that she'd investigate other roles for me in the store), but after being scheduled a handful of times in the other department I was back in my old department. Then during a deceptively positive one-on-one, my manager was like ""about that switch.. do you mind working with this department still. I said, "" don't want to hurt team productivity, I know you have had some major concerns about my performance and although I like working in this team, if I'm not a good fit I understand if I gotta be moved elsewhere in the store."" 

She said, ""I like you.."" and other positive dismissive stuff that indicated things were copacetic. 



**I was given a chance to switch roles within our department but that was shot down because it would involve a raise.** My manager made it like I had a solid chance at this ""promotion"" but turned the interview into a form of reprimand and told me I had less than week to shape-up or be put on an action plan. A far cry from the very prior two one-on-ones win which it was indicated everything was fine enough and I at least had options. Like, I'm not imagining this... **it was indicated I ahjd a real good shot at this promotion (still part-time) from a sales role to a techincal role.** 


My manager said if I was in a tech role, I'd still do what I do now but would not be graded on sales. This seemed like a win-win for everyone. Yet, a week later during the interview it became a ""bait and switch."" I played it cool but in my head I was cursing up a storm. Two days after that bait and switch, I was given the chance to switch departments for a second time. A clear demotion but I was fine with this because I wanted to get the heck out of my current department two months earlier and she didn't act on it then. I was hopeful that this would finally happen. 



I wanted out of my current department because it's a toxic environment, and while being overworked/exploited with full-time and near full-time hours, I'm being given a tough time about my performance. Two weeks ago I worked 39 hours, six days out of seven and three of those days consisted of shifts that were longer than ten hours.



&amp;nbsp;


Cautiously optimistic about switching departments for the second and hopefully final time, but I didn't press her on when. Felt more optimistic when I was told to send an e-mail stating that I understood that I'd have to take a pay cut. 

Now I'm not on next week's schedule. **I want to file for unemployment after I inevitably get terminated.** I am gathering records of my schedules to make the case that I am working full-time hours as a part-timer so that I can add this info to the record during a hearing. A hearing because if I apply for unemployment, the company will fight it and they'll use very write-up I ever signed against me.",finance
financialindependence,Churning for FIRE/retirement.,"Since churning came up in the DD today and it's a topic I like to ruminate about, here's a fun thought experiment: churning for FIRE/retirement. 

There is definitely some amount of crossover between FIRE-minded people and churners. And there are other FIRE-minded people who seem to not like churning or think it's not worth the time. Some recent comments about it made me play around with the numbers so I wanted to share some of these concepts. Enjoy! 

For context, churning is act of getting credit cards for their signup bonuses. I'm using a general version of the term here because I'm going to focus on a single card and keeping it for a long time. Churners, forgive me for the transgression. (That being said, at the end I generalize it to be more than about the single card.)

The first bit is a repost of comment I made on the churning subreddit last year, modified for context and tenses.  The rest is newly written for this FIRE-oriented post. 

One quick pre-discussion note is any hobby/side-job that makes the amount(s) described below for the length of time(s) calculated would have the same results. Churning is the lens I've chosen to show this concept through but of course a side-job or business or something else more to your interest might be preferable. 

***

There exists a card called the Schwab Platinum. It allows for cashing out of Amex Membership Rewards (MR) points at 1.25 cents each to the Schwab brokerage account. At that point you can invest it within the Schwab brokerage account or pull it out (to go to a bank account, or different brokerage, etc).

When I got approved for the card I immediately cashed out 1M MR for $12,500. They had accumulated over several years of churning. Let's say I keep earning 24k MR/month (enough to cash out $300/month) indefinitely.

I'm 25 now so 40 years before traditional retirement age.

Using investor.gov calculator.

* Initial investment: $12,500
* Monthly contribution: $300
* Length: 40 years
* Interest rate: 7%
* Compounding: monthly

Results:

&gt;In 40 years, you will have $991,336.66

There is ~1 million at standard retirement age. 

***

Now let's dig into a bit more of what's practical and not, and do some modified calculations. Some notes: 

This assumes the Schwab Platinum card and 1.25 cashout value/feature will continue for 40 years. It also ignores the cost of keeping the card ($550 annual fee, though it has some benefits that add some value back). It also ignores where I (or someone else) would *want* to keep doing this for 40 years. Churning burnout is a thing. But as a general concept from keeping one card, the math checks out.

You might ask what it would take to get 24k points - worth the $300 - per month. Spending $24k/month with 1 point per dollar spent would do it. Of course most people don't spend that much (though someone with a business might). The card does have some higher-point categories: 5 points/$ on flights, for example. Realistically, however, one wouldn't typically accumulate that many points from spending. 

24k is more realistic when considering other things a churner might do like referrals, manufactured spend, and signup bonuses from other Amex cards. It's 24k*12 = 288k points/year which is very doable for a quasi-moderate churner (or a family churning together). This would be multiple cards within the Amex ecosystem, cashing out through the one consistent card. 

***

Here's a bit of a FIRE twist with somewhat-accurate numbers.

I actually cashed out approximately 2.5M MR within the first 6 months of having the card. And my ongoing accumulation of Amex MR is higher than the 24k in the original concept. Let's say 80k/month for ease of numbers ($1k/month) and do an ""early retirement"" at age 45. 

* Initial investment: $31,250 (2500000*1.25/100)
* Monthly contribution: $1000
* Length: 20 years
* Interest rate: 7%
* Compounding: monthly

Results:

&gt;In 20 years, you will have $647,137.25

That's lean-FIRE-able!

***

Frankly I don't think this is sustainable for 20 years (both in terms of the card/cashout-option lasting that long, and/or my interest in it or ability to have that many points incoming consistently). But, maybe. 

Let's do one more calculation that captures a very-realistic scenario. For this, I'll do 5 years of MR accumulation/cashing-out at the rate in the above calculation, and then take the end result after 5 years and keep it for 35 years (until age 65) with no further points incoming into the calculation. So basically an early-to-mid-20s person/couple getting into churning semi-seriously for 5 years and then leaving their proceeds to simmer until retirement age. 

* Initial investment: $31,250 (2500000*1.25/100)
* Monthly contribution: $1000
* Length: 5 years
* Interest rate: 7%
* Compounding: monthly

Results:

&gt;In 5 years, you will have $115,893.69

Now let's keep that invested for 35 years with no more contributions.

* Initial investment: $115,893.69
* Monthly contribution: $0
* Length: 35 years
* Interest rate: 7%
* Compounding: monthly

Results:

&gt;In 35 years, you will have $1,237,348.42.

***

As explained previously this makes some assumptions around the longevity of the card, cashout feature, interest in churning, and ability to have that many points flowing in for a consistent amount of time. But it's fun to see the numbers play out in this way conceptually at least! 

Another thing to keep in mind is this can be expanded beyond the Schwab Platinum. The $1k of value per month in the latter calculations could easily come from going beyond the Amex ecosystem and doing ongoing churning of various other cards and bank account bonuses with $1k of combined value per month. I can very confidently say that doing $1k of value per month for 5 years (for purposes of the last calculation I presented) is very doable. I've been doing far more than that for 3 years straight while churning personally. So even if someone can't get that many MR points for use with Schwab Platinum itself (or if the cashout feature was discontinued or reduced in value), the results of investing $1k/month from ""churning profit"" are still the same as presented above.

Lastly, I want to point out that many people churn to travel so they'd use these points in a different way. Some would strongly disagree with the notion of investing everything from churning. I have a middle ground where I cover my travel with churning points/profits and invest the rest (which is most of it given volume).

***

Hopefully this is helpful for those who have been on the fence about churning or didn't know much about it. If you're actively churning now, how much do you think you bring in per month/year that is investable? Would be curious to hear if others think they can apply these calculations to their actual churning results.",finance

personalfinance,Should I move back to my anxiety inducing house to save money?,"Hello,

I’m currently 24, living in Boston. I was living in NYC after college between 22-24, and I wasn’t really able to save a lot of cash. A lot of the money I had saved I had to use to emergency move from NYC to Boston to escape a toxic, abusive situation. 

Now in Boston, I can’t find a job using my degree. It’s a fancy STEM field degree before you ask, no one wants to hire me. I had a full time job and worked as an RA in college which left little time for internships. I do have some experience in my field but idk no one wants to hire me. Also, I make almost the same at my job right now vs starting salaries in my field.

I currently work in the service industry as a supervisor at a coffee shop. I make enough to pay my rent and bills, make the monthly minimum on my private loan debt, and have some left over for personal use. I don’t make enough to save, not enough to pay my federal loans.

I’ve been contemplating moving back home to South Florida, especially since my landlord is hot headed, asks for a group check for rent each month, half my roommates don’t pay on time so me and another roommate have to front them AND now he’s threatening to evict us when mail is late/lost even though we sent it on time. Looking for a new apartment especially now during the summer would be a pain in the ass, but I’m trying. However, looking at what’s available I got very lucky with my $700 + utilities room considering all I see is $800&lt; plus utilities. 

Also, I make a little cash as a side hustle modeling, acting, and being a social media influencer. I made a lot more in NYC, and I’m thinking I could definitely make more in South Florida than I do in Boston.


HOWEVER, my family life is very complicated. I have depression and anxiety, which gets triggered a lot back home because everyone in my house is always screaming at each other. People stay out of my way, but my mom and dad hate each other. My mother treats me like I’m 12, and we have talked about me moving back since I am someone who likes to go out (when I have the $$$), I date, etc. She said she would be “fine” with it but freaks out whenever I’m at the grocery store for over 20 minutes.

My plan would be to move back to south Florida, immediately find a job (or two if I can) and save up / start paying down my 40k college debt. Probably try to avoid being at home for the most part, hopefully with two jobs, going to auditions, etc. I have a couple of friends in Miami, not as many as I do in Boston however. 

Is the stress worth saving $$$? My parents won’t charge me rent, I would just be paying a car lease / insurance. I was hoping to live there for a year, and then move out.

Tl:dr - Should I move back into a stressful house just to save up money and pay off some of my student debt, or keep trying to make it away from home?",finance

Eventually this trade war will end (here's going long on beto 2020 and getting back into the TPP), but in the meantime what sectors are heavily impacted by this trade war and specifically what firms?

I'm looking for some buying opportunities, either going on the inverse with put spreads or buying stocks of reliable firms that could start a rebound when the trade war ends. 


So i'm just hunting for those good long term buys



You can stop reading here: Now i know the debate, ""recession is coming 2020, stay in cash"" because of the length of this current business cycle, and these tariffs could trigger an economic recession. IE Prices rise due to tariffs = lower consumption = required cuts in firms = domino effect of job loses. [Many people point to steel, but looking at charts provided by the St Louis fed, which i don't know if that's an accurate way of looking at steel prices](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/WPU101), we can see that steel is back around 2012 prices. Of course steel isn't the only part of the equation and in general prices...should rise. Though we may not see drastic rises in prices due to better supply chain management and automation. But back to the point, a 2020 recession; a neoliberal democrat election win may stave that off especially if they signal signing into the TPP and lifting certain tariffs on china (materials). Something like the TPP would boost demand for US goods/services (especially ones protected by new IP rules in the TPP albeit they're softer that when the US was in), and would drastically reduce costs to US firms who wish to/currently operate internationally in the TPP trade zone (streamline regulations = less admin overhead).",finance
MachineLearning,[P] Generating Game of Thrones Characters Using StyleGAN,"Hi everyone. I've been working on a project where I use StyleGAN to generate fake images of characters from Game of Thrones. Here are some of the results:

[Game of Thrones character animations from StyleGAN](https://reddit.com/link/bp1el3/video/ndz6aoayzey21/player)

I wrote an article that describes how StyleGAN works and how to use it to generate and modify images of Game of Thrones characters. The article includes a Colab notebook for you to reproduce my results. Here are the links :

* Article: [https://blog.nanonets.com/stylegan-got/](https://blog.nanonets.com/stylegan-got/)
* Colab notebook: [https://colab.research.google.com/github/iyaja/stylegan-encoder/blob/master/generate\_GoT\_characters\_with\_StyleGAN.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/github/iyaja/stylegan-encoder/blob/master/generate_GoT_characters_with_StyleGAN.ipynb#scrollTo=LKzLQp1QIkHd)
* GitHub repo: [https://github.com/iyaja/stylegan-encoder](https://github.com/iyaja/stylegan-encoder)

&amp;#x200B;

Something interesting to note: All the results (images and animations) were generated from Nvidia's StyleGAN that was pretrained on the FFHQ dataset, with absolutely no fine-tuning.

&amp;#x200B;

Instead, to make StyleGAN work for Game of Thrones characters, I used another model (credit to [this GitHub repo](https://github.com/iyaja/stylegan-encoder)) that maps images onto StyleGAN's latent space. I gave it images of Jon, Daenerys, Jaime, etc. and got latent vectors that when fed through StyleGAN, recreate the original image.

&amp;#x200B;

With the latent vectors for the images in hand, it's really to modify them in all the ways described in the StyleGAN paper (style mixing, interpolations, etc.) as well as through simple arithmetic in the latent space (such as shifting the latent vector in the ""smiling direction""). As a bonus, since there's no StyleGAN training involved, all the steps that I just mentioned can be executed extremely fast.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, stick around to the end of [the article](https://blog.nanonets.com/stylegan-got/) to see a result of character style mixing that might be very interesting to Game of Thrones fans.",technology

***Story***: I sold AMD stock to have $60k after capital gains, put that into a new savings account that has a good interest rate, and signed up for a car loan through Acura Financial Services to take advantage of incentives ($1,500 discount + 1.9% APR). It auto-deducts minimum + 25% each month from that savings to cover the cost of the loan.

I'm not sure what I *should* do as currently as it's not a safety hazard, but a nuisance. They are replacing malfunctioned parts with malfunctioned parts... which doesn't solve anything (i.e. like the shitty Macbook keyboards being replaced with the same shitty keyboards).

***NOTE: Lemon laws doesn't apply since safety isn't affected. It's just I'm severely inconvenienced because the radio / maps / apple carplay / etc. isn't working.***",finance
financialindependence,How do you calculate optimal times to make Roth Conversions of after-tax 401k?,"So as many of you know, some 401k plans allow in-plan rollovers of after-tax 401k contributions to Roth, basically allowing you to put well over $19,000 into a Roth per year.

The difficult part is that you have to pay taxes on any gains between when you contribute, and when you roll over, and there is usually a flat fee for the rollover charged by the provider.

How do you mathematically determine how often to convert when the market is volatile?

3 examples assuming a $50 flat fee:

If you convert every paycheck weekly to avoid any taxes, you're throwing away $2,500 a year which is  throwing away money and not worth it.

On the contrary, if you roll over annually, and a really good market year results in 20% gains on $20,000 worth of contributions rolled over, you're paying taxes on $4,000 in gains! That can be as much as $2,000 depending on your state and federal tax brackets, which could've been avoided by converting more frequently.

If the market tanks between your contribution and conversion, you can't deduct capital losses, so it might be better to wait to convert to reduce fees paid?

How do you approach this? Obviously it's not worth the time to micromanage the 401k every week keeping an eye on value vs cost basis, but there is also value in avoiding unecessary taxes and fees.",finance
personalfinance,Should I take a personal loan to pay off another high interest loan?,"So, I have a student loan in my home country of about $15K with an interest rate of 12%.

btc,"""The unanimous opinion is, no, he’s not Satoshi Nakamoto."" --Elaine Shannon, Writer of ""Hunting LeRoux""","I was very curious about the past days' rumors of Paul Calder LeRoux having a chance at being Satoshi and I read Elaine Shannon's book so I figured she'd be the preeminent expert on the subject. I was expecting a short reply (I just used the [Contact Me](https://www.elaine-shannon.com/new-page-4) page on her website) and was astounded to get this reply. Thanks again to her for taking the time to write it. It's shared with her permission, and I'll direct her to this thread so maybe she can answer questions if she has time under her own account. I can't wait for the Michael Mann's movie!

.

My original question was something along the lines of, ""Do you think that LeRoux could be Satoshi because of the timelines matching up roughly with the time that Satoshi disappeared and that LeRoux was arrested? Also their backgrounds in cryptography (E4M / Truecrypt / etc.).""

&gt;Thank you for writing me.  I agree that it's fun to speculate about Paul LeRoux and what a man with his brainpower would make of cryptocurrency, the dark web and all sorts of marriages of technology and crime.  But if you’ve read  Hunting LeRoux, you know I’ve had extensive and in some cases exclusive access to several people who know Paul LeRoux as well as anyone can.  I’ve concentrated on exploring his character, as they observed him at close range.  Since that theory came out, I’ve contacted all of them. The unanimous opinion is, no, he’s not Satoshi Nakamoto.  As I mentioned on my Twitter feed, he didn’t have the necessary time to spend experimenting with a project whose money-making potential was uncertain at best. in the 1990s, he was hustling hard.  He published E4M in 1998, as a means of advertising his skills, but he was also chasing IT jobs on several continents and looking to get married again.  From 1999 to 2002, he was working long hours as CTO of SecurStar, a cybersecurity venture set up by Wilfried Hafner, LeRoux’s mentor at the time. Hafner was close to LeRoux but fired him in 2002 when he discovered that LeRoux had pilfered and sold a valuable string of code developed  by others in the company to operate security devices called crypto-tokens.  After that, LeRoux went off to make his fortune and founded RX Limited as a star-up internet commerce pharmaceutical sales venture in 2004. His sites brought in $300 million in sales between 2007 and 2011, according to a DEA analysis.  He never asked for payment in bitcoin or offered to pay for anything in bitcoin, as far as my sources know. He always took payment for pharmaceuticals in the form of credit card charges, usually VISA.  He considered setting up his own bank and VISA franchise.  For darker deeds, he wanted cash or gold bars.  Iran paid him for an explosives formula with $5 million in gold bars.  
&gt;
&gt;.
&gt;
&gt;In 2009, when bitcoin emerged, he was busy launching multiple ventures  As I detailed in Hunting LeRoux, among these were small arms sales, trading in hard drugs, trading in smuggled gold, building a submarine, devising a new missile navigation system for Iran and  setting up a new base in Somalia, where he intended to make himself into a white warlord, expanding his arms business into an Amazon-for-arms platform with fortified bases, his own militia, barracks, warehouses for arms, an airstrip, a seaport and so on.  Significantly, he discovered oil on the land he controlled but declined to drill it, saying it would take too long to turn a profit.  
&gt;
&gt;.
&gt;
&gt;To sum up, several associates say he might have the intellectual skills to participate in the invention of cryptocurrency, but he didn’t have the resolve, patience, passion for that particular kind of secrecy or collaborative bent necessary to pull off such a feat. He was a man in a hurry for guaranteed results, fast, and he dropped a series of ideas that wouldn’t deliver huge returns.  He was a loner with no real friends and business partners. There’s a reason he demanded to be called Boss and regularly threatened to kill his senior lieutenants.
&gt;
&gt;.
&gt;
&gt;Now, however, no one discounts the possibility that he might be thinking of a new way to mine cryptocurrency or game the system.  He is in a federal facility, awaiting sentence, and has a lot of time on his hands.
&gt;
&gt;.
&gt;
&gt;Best,

personalfinance,Truck Loan Payoff question regarding applying for a mortgage?,"I only owe just over $2k before my truck is paid off. I would like to apply for a mortgage loan for a house that probably wont stay on the market for very long, so the process here might need to be quick. Is it more wise to apply for a loan with debt obligations, or pay off the truck then apply? I have read that it might drop my credit score by a few points but my Transunion CS sits at 814, I don't think a few point drop would matter for the interest rates available to me.",finance
personalfinance,Should I dump all my extra cash each month into my student loans or do something else with it?,"My gut is saying I should stop saving and just pay down my loans, but I thought I’d get a second opinion.

Background: I graduated almost a year ago with $30k in federal student loans. I’ve paid off $6k. I have 4 loans, all between $2900 and $7900 and between 3.8% and 4.66% interest. Minimum payments are ~$230, but currently paying $500. No other debt.

I’ve also saved up ~$14k in a savings account (low interest right now). 

I net $3500/month after taxes, health insurance, HSA, and an 8% Roth contribution. Monthly expenses hover around $2500. So I have almost $1000 every month left over. I had been putting that into my savings account, but now that I have a healthy emergency fund, would it be better to pay off my student loans faster?

My boyfriend and I will also be planning a wedding in the next 2 years. I’m thinking at least $15k of my money will need to be available in 18 months for that. Should I keep saving towards that goal, throw the money into student loans, invest or do something else? Is there a downside to paying them down that I’m not seeing? 

Tl;dr: $24k in student loan debt at ~4% interest. $1000k/month after expenses to play with. Healthy emergency fund saved. Pay down loans, keep saving, invest somehow, or do something else?",finance
personalfinance,"This has got to be too good to be true, right?","I'm in some pretty deep credit card debt for how much money I earn. I owe about 10k on horrible cards with even worse interest rates. Basically, I have to pay a minimum of 400 dollars each money to just barely put a dent in the total balance. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, I got a letter in the mail saying I was preapproved for a loan to pay off the entire balance at a pretty good interest rate. I could've easily paid that off in 5 years or less. I called and gave my information to see if I could get the loan. 

I misunderstood what 'preapproved' was apparently, because I was not approved for any loans because of my terrible credit. Understandable. That's the reason I never applied in the first place. I only gave his one a shot because I was already approved, so I thought.

&amp;#x200B;

So they call me back a few days later to break the news to me but it's okay, they have a few programs to help people like me. To keep this short, the program that was best for me was an even better offer than the loan I wanted. I would be paid off in 2 years, with low payments, and a guaranteed 700 credit score, up a ton from my 550. All this in two years? What the hell. Tell me more. What's the plan and also the catch, I asked. 

&amp;#x200B;

There was no catch, but the plan was this: 

They said I would stop paying my credit cards. I stop paying and let them close out my account and sell the balance to a third party. That third party comes to collect and I tell my new ""financial adviser."" My adviser then mails them a huge envelope requesting proof that I owe them the money - apparently something they don't have. ""All they get from the credit card company is your name and basic information on an excel spreadsheet. You owed the money to Wells Fargo, not them. And they can't prove you owe them anything."" Which leads to them releasing the debt. 

&amp;#x200B;

Morally, I didn't want to do that. But apparently the credit card company gets my balance paid for from some tax credit, and they also get an extra 10% from that third party who bought the balance for 10% of the total. So, the third party loses almost nothing, and who cares, they make a huge profit on the people who DO pay. The credit card company actually makes more money by selling my balance than if I would've just paid it outright. 

&amp;#x200B;

I can't find any information online about this potential scam. And I'm wondering how they'd even scam me in the first place, other than a few months of $200 payments. If that were the case, I'm out those payments AND my credit cards are closed. 

&amp;#x200B;

Can someone please give me some advice on this? It really seems way too easy so I told them I'd give it some thought before I just accepted to stop paying on the credit cards I finally got back to paying.",finance
personalfinance,Is 5% closing cost with 4% interest rate normal for 150k loan?,"Hey everyone, I just wanted to know as a new home buyer. I have done a loan on with a company and the interest came up to 4% but the closing cost is a reaping 5% of the total cost. The Average I'v seen are like 2% in the upper realm. and my loan is less than 150k!! WITH GOOD CREDIT (790)!! There are really weird fees and cost that I don't feel is fair. I was wondering if it was a good idea to look for more loans before I close down this house (within 1 month).

I know some banks (like chase) ads say 0 closing cost, which would be good for me but I also know that they may up that for the interest. But i'd never know unless I try at it and see estimates either, but i feel as if it may be too late. I don't hate the interest rate- just the closing cost seems too high and that was not foreseeable beforehand.

personalfinance,Boyfriend can't get loan for car. Advice?,"Boyfriend just got first fulltime job, 30k a year. Wants to upgrade his car, which strikes me as an ok decision, the current one seems unreliable. His father has offered him a sports car for 14k, it's a little over a decade old and has been well taken care of and is some kind of limited edition something which apparently adds value (I don't understand the car industry tbh, but it sounds like more reliable transportation).

Anyhoo he can't get the loan to buy it because he has no credit score yet and his dad says he can't wait for him to increase it over time because he needs to sell the car soon. He also can't find a good enough cosigner, I have a good credit score but a short history, his stepfather has a long credit history and a shitty score. His father offering the car says he has too many loans out already for his real estate dealings. His sister got burned by someone after cosigning a year ago and is too skittish. The list goes on.

I see there are agencies that would lend to him (or at least say they lend to people with poor credit), but I want to know if that's a terrible idea. Is the interest rate the only downside? Are there any that aren't going to screw him? Is this whole thing a lost cause? He really wants the car and it would break his heart but if it's not meant to be I suppose that's it.

It think that's all the necessary information, but I can give a little more if I need to, I'm just trying to stay relevant.

personalfinance,Student loans in 2nd default &amp; other misc debt - what are my options? I am so so overwhelmed.,"Hi Reddit. I'm in desperate need of help because I have to get my shit together.  I have loans that were with AES but are going through their second default. I've suffered from a disability for 4 years and well, I destroyed my credit and have no clue how to get things under control again. In short, I've defaulted twice on my student loans. I have a federal loan thats now when PHEAA and two private student loans that are with a guarantor (that doesn't even have a working phone number).   Plus some medical debt in collections. 

To top it off, I have severe memory impairment and I can't even remember taking out loans. Like...it would be so easy for a creditor to fake a debt on me right now, because I'd have no recollection of opening any accounts. 

*On to the collections/loans....*

**PHEAA $19,500 - 2nd default**

PHEAA wants $475/mo and I cannot afford this. If they start garnishing, I'll have to stop medical treatment completely and move (which further would cause me to lose my job). 

If I consolidate, they said it would be $200-300/mo payment. Which, I can't do that much on top of paying back all my other debts too.

**TSI $9,302 &amp; $6,218  - I'm guessing this is 2nd default as well**

Private guarantor. AES says these were private loans, even though I don't specifically recall taking out private loans.   I think these are valid, even if I don't recall them. 

I haven't been able to get any additional info for them because the phone # AES provides takes me to a voicemail...?  Working on tracking down the real number. 

**Other Collections $1657**

This is mostly medical bills. I had way more, but they've fallen off my credit. 

Average age of these is 4-5 years. 

**Active CC****

I have $1900 in active credit cards that I am able to make on time payments for without an issue. 



**I HAVE SO MANY QUESTIONS**

I don't know what I'm doing. Not one bit.  

From what I'm reading, I think consolidating all the student loans is the best bet. But are there non-profits? 

Who is a scam and who isn't? 

Where can I get these consolidated so I can make a $200-300 payment/mo on all of them? 

Would they consolidate my medical debt in collections with them? If so I could afford a higher monthly payment.

**What I have** 

I probably have the option of being able to take out a $3-4k 401k loan at 5% interest. If I do this, I'll have to make monthly payments on that but it could take care of the other collections &amp; active credit cards. I do not have enough in my 401k to cover all of these debts.

Ideally, payments under $350/mo. 

**Ok, I'm crying now**

To be perfectly honest, I can't even get my budget set up right. It's a dumb excel sheet and I'm having so much trouble accounting for everything. No matter what I do, I'm left with about $20 at the end of the month. I make decent money, around $58k, but I can't keep up.  Cost of living as a single 35yo woman thats in permanent medical treatment is *absolutely ridiculous.*

personalfinance,Advice on my budget?,"I've been using a rough budget for the past 2 months, and I just sat down with my sister over the past couple days and fine tuned it to exact payments on exact days, which paycheck they'll come out of, etc through the end of the year.

With this being said, I have a couple questions I'd really like advice on  if you fine people of r/personalfinance would be so kind as to give it to me.

My current standings as of today are:

\&gt; Savings: $1250

\&gt; I have a gun and watch I'm looking to sell for hopefully $850 and $150, respectfully, that would go to savings.

\&gt; Credit Card Debt: $2250

\&gt; Student Loans: $17,400 (Grace ends July; 200/mo for standard payments and $58/mo for IDR first year)

&amp;#x200B;

I'm currently set at $1,000 per pay period (paid on 5th and 20th of each month). Out of this comes:

\&gt; Paycheck of the 5th - $120 phone bill, $50 subscriptions, $80 gas, $100 into savings, $300 into my credit card, $50 into my IRA, and the remaining 290 will be kept for food and indiscretionary spending. Whatever is left over goes towards savings and CC debt. This should be a decent amount, since I meal prep lunches on weekdays and my BF and I have agreed to not eat out for a while on weekends to save money on both ends.

\&gt; Paycheck of the 20th - $150 car insurance (paid for following month, due on the 1st), $250 utilities (paid for following month, also due on the 1st), $80 gas, $58 - $200 student loans (still waiting on approval for income driven repayment plan), and a mandatory $100 into savings. The remaining 220 will be used for food and indiscretionary spending. Whatever is left from that by the night of my next pay period will go into savings.

&amp;#x200B;

My questions are this...

1. Should I just pay off the CC debt ASAP and then funnel the mandatory $200, AND the $300 I was paying towards my CC into savings? My sister advised against it, since she thinks I ought to have an emergency fund, however I feel like it's senseless to sit on the money while my CC has a 24% interest rate. I can essentially pay it off next month, if I really wanted to. Plus, worst case scenario I could still use the CC in an emergency (car breaks down, wreck, etc) since it is still liquid, right?
2. My aim is to have AT LEAST 3k in savings and &lt;10% (&lt;$350 on one card, &lt;$50 on the other) of the my CC utilization (at which point I'll just make low monthly payments) by October, as my BF and I are looking into me moving up to his city/in with him around that time. This will likely be a good thing, since there are more jobs within my degree there and I'd have a very high chance at finding a better paying EHS/HR job. However, is there anything else you guys would recommend I do to prepare myself for this? I already plan on cutting and heavily monitoring my indiscretionary spending since I know that, while I never really go over budget on it, I can fuck off and spend more than I need to on useless shit while that leftover money could just add to my savings by the end of the month.
3. I'm a 22 yo male, I know it's never to early to contribute to retirement, so I've been contributing $50 a month into an IRA, but should I be putting more into this to try and get closer to my 6k/year contributing cap? Or should I just keep shoveling more money into my savings and emergency fund? My thoughts on the matter are to continue putting in $50/mo into my IRA until I get my savings up to AT LEAST 10k, then I'd like to take half the savings and put it into an investment account and keep the other half for an e-fund. At this point is where I'd feel comfortable putting more than $50/month into my IRA (or if I get a pay increase/better job, ofc). Is this dumb?

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT:

So I think I have a game plan for the CC and Savings. Question 1 is answered. 

I'm going to bomb the CC debt out of the way with my current savings, May 20th check, and June 5th check - and then allocate all extra funds from my June 20th check onwards into my savings. This will let me knock my CC debt down to $100 before my next statement hits as well as get my savings to 2.6k by the end of October, 3.6k including the gun and watch sale.

&amp;#x200B;

Question 3 is essentially answered by the flowchart on one of the comments. I'm going to stick with 50/month for now and stick to my current plan. I still need to build up a savings account over the next 5 years for a down payment on a home and such, so I'll contribute 2.5% of my income to my IRA for the time being. I may bump this up once I'm more comfortable with my savings.",finance
personalfinance,"If I take loan from my 401k, do I have to pay tax twice on the interest?","I am 34, I have 401k with fidelity with around $200k in it. I am looking to take $50k loan from my 401k, fidelity shows me interest rate of 6.5% for 60 months. Total interest $8,631.37

So I am paying 6.5% interest with my after tax dollars into my 401k. As I understand, when I withdraw my 401k after 59.5 years, I will still be taxed on this money ($8,631.37). Does that effectively mean that I am double taxed on the interest part?

personalfinance,Is it a bad idea to try to pay a house off early?,"Hello,

&amp;#x200B;

I have an opportunity to pay off my mortgage off early and was curious if I should consider focusing on that with the disposable income I have coming in. I'm hoping to live in it for the next 6 years (minimum) and then move overseas, rent it out, and earn extra income.

&amp;#x200B;

My mortgage is about 1.3k monthly. I have a 4% interest rate. Currently about $800 of my 1.3k payment is going to interest. I have a little over 29 years left on my mortgage  but I can pay about an extra $500 weekly. I used a mortgage calculator to do the math for me ( [https://www.calculator.net/mortgage-payoff-calculator.html](https://www.calculator.net/mortgage-payoff-calculator.html) ) and it basically said I would be able to pay off my home in 7 years if I did that (rough guesstimation). My intention is to basically save myself the years of accruing interest (It's very frustrating making a payment and not seeing the balance drop) and just the relief of not being in debt. I max out my 401k, Roth IRA, and invest in an ETF/stocks yearly so I'm already planning for retirement. Although it mentioned that I'd save only $64k in interest at the cost of $167k over the next 7 years, money that could be going to investing instead.

Does anyone have any experience or advice on this? I'd appreciate anyone's advice.

Atm, I have 10K saved up. I live a frugal life, so my monthly expenses aren't much. The most expensive expense are my loan payments. 
I am debating on continuing to save normally (around $500 a month) as well as paying some extra on loans each month, or simply taking ALL of my extra income towards the loans and stop saving (during this time I will have a 401k though). There is nothing I'm saving up for, like a house or a car. And I really just hate having this debt over my head. Any advice would be appreciated! Thanks!",finance
personalfinance,"Prepaid debit cards? Also, general advice for me(18 years old)?","Am 18 in U.S. I got a job 1 month ago after a stint of being unemployed. I work approximately 31 hours a week (family run retail store) and get paid a rate of $7.00 for it(below federal minimum wage of $7.25). As this is basically poverty level, I am searching for a new job.

In the mean time, I'm having trouble once I get paid. I have to get the check cashed as I don't have any bank accounts because they were closed after I had 0 balance for like 12 months (chase high school checking) and because I over drafted the other account about $150 (recurring automatic online purchases, my fault for not watching them)at a local credit union.

I tried to cash my paycheck at Bank of America because I heard they do it for free if the check writer is from BoA. Turns out they charge $8 if you don't have an account from them. So I was charged $8 to cash a $185 paycheck.



I always heard being poor is expensive, but now I UNDERSTAND that.



Chase wants to charge me $12 a month for a checking account unless I deposit $500 so I went looking for another account.

Capital One denied me a 360 Checking account (low or no monthly fees)because ChexSystems, basically a credit score system for checking banking and stuff, said I had a low score and was high risk.

Now, I'm waiting for a letter from ChexSystems to tell me why I was denied, but I'm sure it's because I owe my credit union money.

Intuitively the next step is to pay back the credit union so I get my score better, but my weekly check is for about $200. I still need to keep some of that money to buy gas to get to work.

So what I want to do is stop losing $8 (over 1 hour's pay) to cash my check with direct deposit.

It would also help to not have to carry $200 cash around ready to be lost or stolen.

So I'm considering getting a prepaid debit card from Walmart. This should make me get my pay earlier through direct deposit (which many prepaid debit cards offer).

I just need to be careful not to get charged with hidden fees.

Also, I'd be risking my entire paycheck to the card ( if I direct deposit) and I've read horror stories of people losing the money to fraudulent charges and customer service not giving a shit.

I'll do research and listen to people who have had the cards first.

Any advice?",finance
personalfinance,How to determine the amount of cost of living loans to take?,"I'm starting law school this fall and I'm trying to determine the size of my student loan for the coming year.

In total, I have about 13k in debt, interest rate about 6.4%. 

So my question is if it's better to pay off the debt completely BEFORE applying for a mortgage  (does that get me a better deal if we have no debt?), or deal with monthly payments over five years or so while focusing on saving for that down payment. Because we could afford to completely pay off my debt tomorrow if we wanted, but that would mean that savings for a down payment would take a hit.

here's my situation. i'm considering charging the fee of $3600 for summer classes on a credit card. i have the money to pay it in full now, but i figured stretching out the payments over 6 months would give me a (decent?) FICO score. 

&amp;#x200B;

option A: i did a little research and found that the citi simplicity card charges no interest for the first year. also no annual fee. sounds rad. if i charge this card and pay off 3k over 6 months, will this show up positively in credit ratings? will it show up at all, given the fact that i'd be paying nothing in interest?

&amp;#x200B;

option B: my bank has a credit card with no annual fee + a $150 sign up bonus. downside is that the interest rate is pretty high, between 16-25%. bleh. i have no idea what rate i'd qualify for, but if it was closer to the 16% end, i'd be paying about $175 in interest in 6 months. is this the better option? do i need to be paying interest in order to get a FICO score?

I'm graduating with just over 43k in student debt after two degrees. My highest interest rate loans are at 6.8%, but most are around 4.25%. I could funnel about 1k a month into paying off those loans when I start my new job, and pay them off in about 5 years, but my fiance and I were talking and I actually have the money to pay off my loans right now, fully, with money that is currently invested in stocks. So I guess my question is this - is it better, with the growth of the market and the tax hit we will take from selling stocks, as well as the tax benefit I get from interest to keep my loans and slowly pay them off out of pocket? Or should we just pay them off?

I think it would be better just to get them out of the way, as that is what I've seen on this subreddit time and time again.

personalfinance,Should I sell equities to fund a home reno?,"Help me think through this please fellow redditors. Almost done with last stage of home reno (finishing basement), have done a lot of it DIY to save money and stretch budget.  

I have room to draw down on a HELOC to pay for it, need ~100k.  However we’ve already drawn down so much on HELOC that the additional debt service would probably be too much debt to carry.  Since interest rates have gone up I’m already paying ~1500/month towards current HELOC. I’m also paying ~300/month toward principal just to chip away at it, but HELOC is interest only so it’s not going away any time soon (probably not until we sell/move which I don’t want to have to do).   I have a big primary mortgage that I can’t refi (credit union won’t CEMA).  

I’m thinking about selling some stock to raise cash instead of incurring the extra debt.   I have ~700k in equities (~75% in retirement accounts) but am thinking about non-retirement assets to sell.  I have ~75k in former employer company stock that I got through bonuses as the most likely to liquidate.  The balance I may draw from HELOC.  

I’m 47yo, have 3 kids, live in Brooklyn so very high cost of living. Wife is stay at home so I’m sole source of income.  I make good money but pay so much for housing that we don’t save for retirement beyond maxing out 401k.  This house represents the vast majority of my assets (but even more debt).   Some day we’ll sell and probably do well in the long run based on the improvements we’ve made.  

Would it be stupid / short sighted to sell stocks to finish up the work?  Don’t want to gut my retirement funds but also don’t want to go bankrupt with debt service. Thanks for helping me think through it.

personalfinance,Debt Settlement - DIY or use a company?,"Asking this for a friend since she doesnt use reddit.

Basic background: my friend admitted she's in massive debt. She took out loans and CCs to help out family and to handle some emegencies.

I asked her for a rough estimate and this is what she gave

Credit cards: around $29,570

Loans: $72,249

Monthly take home: about $5200

She's been current and took a part time job to help offset things. She even put her credit cards in a DMP so her interest rates were lowered. However it seems like her main challenges lie in the loans. Those creditors refused the DMP proposals and she didn't have much luck when she tried to negotiate a better rate herself.

For her, she is stressed that even with a tight budget she barely has enough left over for savings/emergency fund.  She's afraid of bankruptcy and she said she looked at debt settlement companies, checking on reviews from BBB and other sites. I know she's thorough with research so I'm taking her word that if she did choose a debt settlement company, she did her homework.

Though when she asked me for my opinion...I dont know to be honest. I've read the posts here on debt settlement  and it sounds like a mixed/hot mess. Plus if my understanding of the process is correct....sounds like she could do it herself right?

We have 18k left on our car, which we just bought recently (used). We currently put $600 a month towards paying that off. Interest rate is 4%.

We have 30k left in student loans and pay $600 a month towards them. Interest rate is 6%.

We have 50k left on our double wide mobile home. Interest rate is 7% (OUCH). But it's $800 a month cheaper than renting a house would be, and it's a resident-owned park--the residents control the rent, a for-profit organization doesn't own it--so that's good.

I know that it is recommended to pay off loans with the highest interest rate first; however, I am a bit confused because my loan with the highest rate (5.05%) is subsidized. I will be starting a 2-year Master's program in the fall, so (correct me if I'm wrong) that means the loan won't accrue interest for another two years. The balance on this loan is $5500.

The other highest balance loan has a principal of  $7500 and a current balance of $8,219.18 with an interest rate of 3.76%. I am considering paying the $5500 towards this one so it won't accrue as much interest during grad school. 

I also have two other loans with balances of $3,709.48 and $1,636. Both of these have interest rates of 4.45%.

personalfinance,Buying house in one year and looking for some help/suggestions (x-post from r/MilitaryFinance),"Trying to understand what makes most sense/will save me the most money in the long run. For context, I'm an O3E with about 13 years in and career designated so if all goes well, I should make it to my 20 (legacy retirement system). My wife does not work and the only debt we have is a $20k car payment that will be paid off in the next three years.

&amp;#x200B;

The scenario:

&amp;#x200B;

Looking to buy a house next April in the 350-375k range. I have $0 saved in an emergency fund but have saved $17k in my wife and I's Roths (strictly for a down payment). We also have about $1200 each in our retirement Roths (Vanguard index funds) that I'll look to start contributing about $400/mo each next year after the house is secured (so about $800/mo total). 

&amp;#x200B;

I won't be able to put 20% down on the house (the most I'm looking at would be about $20k with another $5-$6k available for closing costs/anything else for the house at that time). So this is essentially 5% down so I'll be left with 1.5% VA funding fee, which would be about $5k. My question is, should I even withdraw my money from the Roths to put this down payment on the house or just put $0 down and get the 2.15% funding fee (increasing the fee to about $7k.). My question really boils down to is it worth it to put anything down just to save a few thousand on the funding fee or keep that money in my Roth and let the market compound it for the next 30 years?

&amp;#x200B;

I know I need to get a emergency account going, so perhaps I'll just save up about $5-8k in a HYSA before we close on the house and use that for house emergencies.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit:  I forgot to mention that my BAH will cover my entire house payment so I won't be coming out of pocket for monthly mortgage payments. The only thing coming out of my pocket would be the down payment and closing costs (but hoping to get seller to cover those).  Additionally, the reason I'm saving money in a Roth for a down payment is because I'm not able to max it so I might as well save the house downpayment in there as well so I can 1) withdraw 100% of my contributions and 2) so I can take advantage of the $10k tax free withdraw of any gains.  Further, my federal pension will be in the $40k/year range which starts in seven years, which is why I'm not worried too much about paying off my car before I buy a house, having a 30 year emergency fund, etc.  I have $800/month extra after all expenses for everything is paid.  My only question is whether to withdraw from my Roth to pay for the down payment or keep it in there and let the compounding do the work for the next 30 years.

datascience,Help needed for time series analysis and data mining for prediction,"Hello! My partner and I have been working for this on a couple weeks and feel that we're just out of our depth and unsure how to proceed. I'll describe the dataset first, what we are hoping to do, and the steps we've taken thus far. All analysis is being done in R studio.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The dataset:

Enrollment in a state-based health insurance exchange. Each row contains

*  an application ID and person ID which should allow us to track the person across time; 
* demographic data including age group, race, year of birth, income as a % of Federal Poverty Level, and ZIP code; 
* plan information including the carrier, type of plan, plan premium, plan deductible, actuarial value, tax credit (binary yes no), and plan year; 
* enrollment data including the enrollment status (disenrolled, disenrollment initiated, coverage end initiated, canceled, in progress, initiated, change in enrollment, renewal initiated, renewal modified, confirmed, active) and the enrollment start and end dates (as POSIX variables).

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The ask:

To determine if enrollment behavior can be predicted for $X change in premiums, taking into account the other variables that may influence enrollment as listed above. We'd like to explore this from multiple avenues including clustering, regression, neural networks, and SVM.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Steps so far:

We've created a few dataframes that will work for different models and algorithms. The base dataframe has a lot of categorical, nominal variables as factors (age group, actuarial level, FPL, race, gender, enrollment status) with some discrete, numerical variables (premium, deductible) and the two identifying numerical variables (application ID and person ID). We then created a numeric dataframe with all of the categorical variables either recoded as ordered numeric when appropriate (ie: age group with ""0-17"" recoded as 0 and ""65+"" recoded as 6) or dummified (race turns into several binary variables).

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Our question is this; how would you folks approach this? We have now a numeric dataframe that can be put through different models, but we aren't sure how to do that. For example, how do we turn this into a time series so we can analyze the trends over time? We'd ideally like to examine them by plan year, looking at how the different individuals behaved within the market and the aspects of their plans and demographics each year. But R only accepts date objects as the time series indicator and the year is considered numeric. How do we ""track"" the people across time? We should be able to since we have the IDs, right? Some ideas we've had so far are to split the data into yearly dataframes and analyze each year individually, then compare **or** to create variables that have the change in variables represented (easy for things like premium, more difficult for things like the plan though that could be a binary indication of new plan/continued plan?). I'm sorry if this seems trivial or simple, we've been trying to figure this out on our own and thought it might help to bring in some experts with real world knowledge.

Forex,Australian Federal Election,"**TL;DR - does anyone have any thought son how the Australian Election will affect AUD pairs?**

Traditionally, people think the outgoing government are better money managers, and the probable incoming government are bad with money.

I don't see it being a tumultuous change of government for Australia - most people think it is time.  There is a small sentiment going toward minor parties and independents, but I don't think they will play a large role either.

I haven't been through an Australian Election while also learning Forex - any pointers?  I'm thinking of closing my positions and watching what happens on Monday morning, but I also don't think much will happen.  I guess if the vote is so close that we don't get a result for a few days that could hurt the pairs.",finance
personalfinance,What to pay down first - Car or home?,"I understand paying down the loans with the highest interest rates first. My home loan interest rate is 4.375% while my auto loan is 6% but when I compare total interest saved over the course of the loan it seems silly to pay down the car instead of the house. I have a few thousand dollars id like to throw on one of these but I'm having a difficult time convincing myself to put it towards the car even though the interest is higher.

My wife and I already pay extra each month on the home loan but I still feel in my gut it's where I also want to put this extra money.

Does it all depend on how much you still owe or is it always more beneficial to pay down the higher interest rates?",finance

personalfinance,"Filed teaxes jointly, federal tax return never came, turns out wife has an unpaid federal student loan...","Created a throwaway account to post this question. The title pretty much explains it. My wife apparently has had an unpaid federal student loan for some time (the account was opened in NOV 2018 and appears to have closed in NOV 2017. We got married last year, filed tax returns for 2018, and my tax return never came. I looked into it today and the IRS says it got used to pay off a federal debt. I was shocked, looked into it and it turns out the US Dept. of Ed has a debt in my wife's name that they applied the loan to. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm still getting details and we need to contact the Dept. of Ed to sort this out. I pulled her credit report (turns out it's not in a good place) and I do see the loan there, with a status of CLOSED, a balance of \~$18k and a note that says  **Seriously past due date / assigned to attorney, collection agency, or credit grantor's internal collection department.**

&amp;#x200B;

I thought I had paid off my wife's loan earlier this year, but turns out that was just one of two loans, so now we have this loan to deal with, plus we need to get her credit back into fighting shape. 

&amp;#x200B;

My credit is very good (800+). We're planning on buying a home sometime in the next 18 months, and have a down payment fund we could pull from to pay off this loan, but it would ofc set us back on savings so I'd want to be smart about how we approach this.

personalfinance,Refinancing my fiancé’s car loan with my name on it?,"My fiancé currently has an auto loan with a 9.25% interest rate. We’re trying to cut down on our expenses recently to save some cash for the wedding and buying a house, and this is one of the last expenses on the the list to tackle besides another credit card debt of hers. When she got the car, her credit score was pretty low and she was in a desperate situation with not a lot of cash on hand, which is why I’m assuming the interest rate was so high. Her credit score is still pretty low, whereas mine is in the low 800s. Is it a wise idea to refinance the loan and putting my name on it to get a better interest rate? And how will it affect our credit scores?

personalfinance,"Just found out I have $1,300 in a traditional IRA and I've slowly been losing money for fees. Should I cash it out?","So I recently discovered I have $1,300 in a traditional IRA with TransAmerica. It's from an old job that I had 4 or 5 years ago when I wasn't contributing much to retirement. I've slowly been losing a few dollars every month due to fees and obviously haven't been contributing to it. So what should I do with this money?

Should I start contributing to this IRA? I already am maxing out my retirement with my current position and have a few hundred in the stock market but I'm not really doing as much as I could be. (Also, I don't really know the way to contribute to this IRA).

I'll be honest, though, money is tight. So should I cash this out and use the money to pay off some debt?

I could completely pay off the remainder of my student loans (or at least get really close) with whatever money I get back. But those payments are very small and the interest rate is good. 

On the other hand, I have about $7,000 in credit card debt that I'm kind of spinning the wheels on. I pay as much as I can every month which ends up being around $300 or so. But obviously the interest rate is much higher. 

So what should I consider doing with this IRA? Contribute to it or cash it out? If I cash it out, how should I spend it? Pay off student loan with low interest rate or pay down some credit card debt?

TL;DR - Can I afford a $2,000 TV setup including warranty if I have &gt;6 Months living expenses setup, a handle on my debt, and should I finance it if doesn't affect my ability to save 20-25% of my salary towards my 401K, Roth IRA, and CD/Savings accounts. I'm anti-social and find it hard to enjoy myself, but watching TV and fitness are some of the few constants, even during episodes of anxiety and depression.

Unfortunately, both of my TVs are developing some issues, namely black bands on the screen. My Fiancee and I have had both TVs for about 5+ years with each one of us bringing one into the relationship.

Most of our leisure time is spent watching TV, running, or at the Gym, so we would like to buy a nice TV to use for years to come, so it won't be cheap, but the one staple throughout our relationship has been bonding over shows, youtube videos, movies, documentaries, and etc. 

My credit is very good, so I qualify for 0% Financing for 24 months, and to offset the risk of the TV crapping out I would buy an extended warranty that allows for immediate replacement to offset the potential loss due to defects and etc. 

I don't feel too comfortable divulging my full financial situation on reddit, but here are the important pieces.

* The TV Expenditure could be $1,500 to $2,000 including TV Console, Warranty, and etc.
* Current savings covers 8 months living expenses and the remaining balance of my car note
* I pay my credit card off every month
* My only major debt is my car at 2.5% interest rate with $16K Balance (My old car's transmission died the week I was moving out of state for a new job)
* On average, I save 20% of my salary before taxes with 8% to company 401K with 4% match, 6% to Roth IRA, and 4% to savings/CD. 
* I could save more, but I have an additional $500 budgeted per month for Fun, Miscellaneous unforeseen items, such as, medical, car repairs, items needed for the house, pet care, and helping my Fiancee if she needs it.

solar,DIYish commercial solar array in Central IL feasible?,"Hello.  A small group of investors and I are looking into the feasibility of starting a moderate commercial solar array (100 to 500 kW) in Central Illinois.  The main focus of the group is based on keeping expenses low to make the project feasible.  We would like to take a nontraditional approach to the construction of the array utilizing local talent including carpenters, electricians, and engineers.  We also would like to focus on reduced waste by using used solar panels and repurposed construction materials.  The investor group is composed of a mechanical engineer, electrical engineer, construction manager, and multiple physicians and others.  Based on my numbers, the construction of the array could be done for well under $1 per watt given that the construction would partially be done by the investors.

&amp;#x200B;

**The pros of the project include:**

very inexpensive land

like-minded investors focused on reduced cost

utilizing used and repurposed items

ability to utilize some of the investors on a part-time basis for maintenance, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

**The cons of the project include:**

limited experience with solar projects amongst the group

utilizing used and repurposed items

only moderate sun with about 1400 kWh per kilowatt per year

&amp;#x200B;

**The questions that I do not know yet are:**

how likely is it that the utility company would sign a contract to purchase electricity from us and at what rate?  The rates that I am reading about are approximately 3 to 4 cents per kWhr.

What are the expected costs for hooking up to the grid, etc.?

Are there better, novel options than selling to the grid for selling the electricity?  Blockchain, alternative storage, etc.

How would one estimate the costs of permits for such a project (1 to 2 acres expected)?

&amp;#x200B;

Based on my numbers, even with a low installation cost, the return on investment is well under 5% per year without incentives, which include SREC and the federal tax incentive in Illinois.  We are very interested in starting a solar project but want to make sure that it is not a losing proposition from the start.  For many of the investors, this will be a small piece of a portfolio well diversified in index stocks and bonds, but we would still hope to get 5 to 10% annualized return on the investment.  We would appreciate any advice.  Thank you.",energy

personalfinance,Loan Forgiveness vs Paying Loans Off,"I'm 32, currently making $67k, I don't have any debt besides $25,500 left in student loans. I'm exactly three years away from having my loans forgiven through the PSLF program. I work for a local government and have been providing annual documentation and thus far I haven't had any issues and seem to be on track for forgiveness.

My question right now is do I wait for potential forgiveness in three years or should I just start paying off these loans? My remaining student loans all carry an interest rate of 6.55%, so it's pretty high. 

I'm currently living with my parents through December of this year until my SO gets back from an out of state job so I won't have any living expenses. I'm currently saving close to $1,800 a month right now and just finished paying off $18,000 in student loans this last year that didn't qualify for forgiveness. I also paid off my car as well.

I currently have a $6500 emergency fund and putting $500 towards my 457B a month. Hoping to do a lot more obviously depending on which way I decide. 

My job is very secure and will be making $80k and above in the next four years through merit increases. So really, these loans will be gone either way in the next couple of years but I'm trying to figure out what makes more sense. Wait for potential forgiveness or just get rid of these loans this year or so. Any information would be great.",finance

Since I’m adding to my savings account which has a higher interest rate than the money market account is there any reason to have cash in a 401K?

personalfinance,Checking Account Suggestions,"Greetings 

New to Reddit so I hope I’m in the right place. I’m looking for suggestions for checking accounts. I currently stash my emergency money at Ally and my primary checking is Citi. I want to change my checking account and maybe earn interest and I’m not currently earning any. Quite frankly, Citi IT is not good and I found their customer service to be poor. 

I narrowed it down to a few choices based on my research so any insight will be helpful:

Charles Schwab Investor Checking
PROS 
Unlimited ATM reimbursement 
Best for foreign travel
CONS
Bare bones features 
Only travel once; maybe twice abroad and usually use a credit card 

Ally

$10 atm fee reimbursement 
Great features
CONS
Low APY



SoFi

atm fee reimbursement 
High APY
CONS
Reports of holding up money and freezing accounts 

Capital One 360
PROS

Three branches near me
Customer service 
CONS

Memory Bank
PROS
High APY checking 
CONS
Not enough research 

Redneck Bank
PROS
High APY
The debit card
CONS
The debit card lol



I pay all my credit card bills the day it’s due in full. My take home pay is a little over $2900 every two weeks and I get reimbursed from my job once a month (use personal card for points) in amounts ranging from $5k to $15k. 

After bills are paid I keep about $200 as a buffer but after bills the rest are put into Ally savings and my Vanguard account. Unsure if any interest rate matters since the dollar amount fluctuates often. 

Ally would be easiest but want to hear opinions on the banks I listed or even ones I missed. 

Also, what would be the benefit if having multiple checking accounts? In theory I can have the Schwab for travel and an online bank for everyday use. If I need to transfer funds I’ll likely write myself a check. 

Any and all input is welcomed and appreciated.",finance

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

Zillow says the house is worth 395k so if that's within 30k I should meet the 80/20 requirement to not pay PMI on a standard loan.

&amp;#x200B;

Broker is telling me I can get a 20 year @ 4.25% and a monthly payment of $1,857 excluding taxes and insurance.  Current escrow is $768 a month but PMI should come out out so let's call it $568 for a total  $2,425 month.

&amp;#x200B;

The interest rate and monthly are significantly higher, but I drop the PMI , shave 7 years off the life of the loan, and build equity quicker.

&amp;#x200B;

New job, which is why I reached out to the broker in the first place, so I can afford the higher monthly payment.  Just not sure if it makes financial sense.

CryptoCurrency,The Bank of England's Chief Economist did a talk at my college today.,"[Andy Haldane](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/about/people/andy-haldane/biography), the Bank of England's Chief Economist (who is one of nine members on the BoE's [Monetary Policy Commitee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_Policy_Committee#Composition) which sets interest rates in the UK and introduced quantitative easing after the 2008 financial crisis) did a talk at my college today. The actual talk was decent, but probably not of interest to reddit.

The questions were interesting however. One person asked what he thought of cryptocurrency and his response surprised me. He said it could replace cash, he even joked about us likely having Bitcoin in our wallets. He said he didn't think it'd replace cash tomorrow, but he was quite open to the idea 20 or 30 years down the line. He was also quite familiar with cryptocurrencies and joked that there were now thousands of them.

Nothing to go crazy about but I thought I'd share.",cryptocurrency
solar,School me on what solar equipment is best,"I'm in central California and looking to get solar on my new home. Since I will be buying it outright, I'm not really counting on getting much or any support from the installers (I'm assuming they'll be out of business by the time I need service) so I want something that is likely to last a long time.

1. I keep hearing that all panels are pretty much the same. Is that true, or will some last longer than others?
2. As far as inverters go, I've been offered Enphase, Solaredge, and Sunpower so far. Which one would be most likely to last?

personalfinance,Refinance 30 Year Mortgage Question (Is it worth it at this point),"About 2.5 years ago I started a 30 year mortgage fixed for 5.25% on a 113k loan. At that time I had little to no credit. (Was sitting at about 630 if I remember correctly)

  
I just had my bank lender reach out to me (Left me a voicemail) to talk about refinancing since they say rates are way cheaper... I always had that in the back of my head since I figured my interest rate was higher than it should have been from the start but due to my little credit it made sense and had to just roll with it at the time.

&amp;#x200B;

I am not sitting at about a 785 credit score. From the research I have done, it sounds like I should not refinance unless I can get a 2% interest rate drop which would mean it has to be 3.25% which seems quite a bit lower than what it is or will EVER be? Would it still be wise to look into this to see if I can get a 1.5% interest rate drop which would be something like 3.75%.

&amp;#x200B;

Side note: I know there are additional closing costs and for my example it would be like $1500-$2000 I would guess...

I also am not sure if anything happens if a appraisal is needed as I have gone from a non finished basement to a completely finished basement without anyone being aware of it. (Basically doubled Sq ft of house)

  
I understand all questions are situational and how long I would be living here ect. At this time I have no plan on moving but in say...10 years from now that could end up being possible.

personalfinance,Questions about a mysterious student loan appearing on my account,"I've been making a real effort to pay down my student loans as much as possible after years of unemployment and underemployment. I completed loan rehabilitation programs and they're now all in good standing according to my student loan servicers, the Dept. of Education and NSLDS. I've got one private loan being serviced by Nelnet and two consolidated Federal loans (one subsidised, one unsubsidised) being serviced by Navient.

However, when I log into my account with Navient, not only do I see my two Federal loans, I also see a Tuition Answer loan that appears to have been taken out by my father my senior year of college. I've never received any notice of this loan and know nothing about it. It looks like the original loan came from Sallie Mae's infamous Tuition Answer Loans and was for $6,500 but now it's up over $17k. At the time this loan was taken out, my father was battling alcohol and drugs and we quickly lost touch as he went off the deep end around this time. I have no connection with him now, and it is entirely possible he may have taken this out without my knowledge to score.

In my Navient portal, it says that this loan is Past Due and instructs me to call them about the loan. I have spent hours on the phone with them this week being bounced around from department to department and supervisor after supervisor. It's been endlessly frustrating, and I recieved some very rude treatment from on of their supervisors who wouldn't help me, but I digress. What I am trying to find out is where this loan came from, why it has increased so significantly,  why there is no interest rate assigned to the loan, who is responsible for paying it back and why is it showing up under my name if I didn't take it out. I am concerned with being held responsible for this loan and having it show up on my credit report.

After being bounced around for multiple hours over the past few days, I have not received full answers to the above, but a supervisor has told me the following (and I have confirmed this with Dept. of Education and NSLDS):

* I am not responsible for this loan
* All of my loans are in good standing
* This loan is currently considered ""charged off""

Looking at my credit report on Credit Karma, I see no mention of this loan or any associated missed payments. I really don't want to be held financially responsible for this loan and despite the assurance I've received over the phone, seeing it appear in my dashboard online has me concerned. 

What can I do to have myself removed from having any association with this loan? What steps should I take to ensure I am not held liable for making payments? How do I make sure this never shows up on my credit report?",finance
financialindependence,State employee whose leave time can go toward retirement pension at a fraction of accrual. Seldom take off. Weighing pros/cons.,"Image of [leave balances](https://imgur.com/a/XYth2Sh)

I earn 7.38 hours of leave biweekly.

Here's how my retirement looks [with](https://i.imgur.com/a1ZGeml.jpg) and [without](https://i.imgur.com/OzAeZMA.jpg) leave balances.

Essentially, if I take every bit of leave that I've earned to this point AND all future leave I accrue, I'll short myself $163.93 every month from the date that I retire until the rest of my life.

If I start to take leave as I accrue the leave, and don't take more that I accrue, then my retirement will be just as projected.

[My FIRE situation](https://old.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/bheokj/crunched_the_numbers_i_can_retire_in_8_years_and/).

I've been with the state for 22 years and I have about 1.5 years of leave. I seldom take off. I've missed family holidays, friends' funerals, graduations, and skip vacations when I do not not take off and I'm beginning to resent seldom taking off. My agency does not have a set ""if you work 20 years, you take off 2 weeks for vacation."" In fact, because I seldom take off, they've come to expect me to be present at work and getting off of work can be difficult (ie I have to have at least 2 people trained for backup duties and I cannot take off if my supervisor or backup has already been approved off. Also don't take off if my section is not fully staffed, or if new staff are not fully trained, or the for the month that we are expecting auditors.) Taking off can be like jumping through hoops... but I am really contemplating if it will be worth jumping through those hoops in order to take off because I believe it will help my morale.

Some would roll the dice and say that it's worth it to continue limiting leave so that they could earn more in retirement. I suppose I'd be curious to hear those arguments as well.",finance
personalfinance,Prioritizing loan debt over getting a home while in graduate school,"Skip to the bottom if you don't think minute financial details are important. I wasn't sure what to include so I just gave all info broken down them summarized it to make sure everything was there.  

Loan Sitatuion: I am a recent bachelor's grad that will be starting medical school in the fall. As of now I have 30k debt from undergrad but in reality 15k of it is from a single semester of pharmacy school (i.e. it is at the graduate interest rate) before I returned to undergrad to finish my BS. My future education will cost approximately 160k for all 10 semesters including fees. The first and last year have 2  16k payments (Aug and Jan) and the middle 2 years have 3 payments (Aug, Jan, Late Apr/May). 

Income/Credit Situation: Currently I'm working @ 17/hr for extra savings over the summer but I will have no job come mid-July to prepare for the semester where I will have no guaranteed income (summer research grants and small odd-jobs or tutoring are potentials). My wife is working full-time TAKING HOME ~70-75k-ish/year doing nails with around 5k/year of this sent to her parents to help them out. I am on the borderline of excellent credit. My wife has a good score but just has 1 CC, a car loan, and an authorized user backing it up. I have found her non-citizen status is damaging to her approval odds. 

Monthly Expenses: Currently 700/month rent, 140/ month utilities + internet, ~300-400/month groceries. Recently higher entertainment/eating out costs due to boredom after graduation, avg. would be 150-250/month.  Parents pay car ins. and phone bill as an assist during college. Cars are paid and relatively new (2010 &amp; 2015) mainstream, reliable Japanese cars so costs should be minimal there but I keep an emergency fund. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TLDR SECTION

Summary: BS grad attending medical school this Fall. Have 30k federal loan debt (15k grad rate, 15k UG rate). Medical school 160k spread out over 4 years. I will not be working, wife works brings home ~65k + tips post-tax after sending some to her parents. Future income is 55-65k/year during 4-5 years residency then full physician salary. Current expenses total ~1500/month or less if being especially frugal. 

Question: I am trying to decide where to prioritize my spending. Renting and just paying for school in cash as much as possible, or purchasing in home and graduating with more debt. It seems that in the long run renting would come out to be the cheaper option but my knowledge of real estate, renting, etc. is limited to the single apartment since starting school. Is limiting debt in this situation preferable to limiting money sunk into rent? I anticipate that if we live frugally and rent total loans could be limited to 60k upon graduation.

personalfinance,Is it possible to remove this late payment mark?,"I signed up for a private loan for 1 semester my first year of college. I just graduated in December and didn't realize that the bank would start posting repayments almost immediately afterwards (because my federal student loan repayments don't begin until August of this year, so I kinda just assumed that all student loans had this grace period. I'm dumb). My address with the bank that I have the loan through was still registered as my parent's house, so they were sending physical payment reminders to their house, and my parents do not open my mail (or even tell me when i get it I guess). So I did not know for several months (mid March) that I was supposed to be making payment. I checked my credit score and saw that it plummeted down to the low 500's (it's thankfully gone back up to low 600's now due to making car payments and stuff), so I immediately went to the bank's website, payed off all past charges, all late charges, and payed the next 2 months of loan repayments all at once. I changed my address with the bank and signed up for automatic payments and E-statements are sent to my email now. I called the bank to try to see if they would consider dropping these late credit marks, but they ended up denying my request. Me and my wife are looking to buy a house soon because I'm getting a job out of state, and all I ever see is that your credit score will pretty much determine if you can buy a house or not, and this really has me worried now. Does anyone have any idea if it's possible to get these late marks dropped? or Am I stuck with them for the foreseeable future?

Here is our situation:

* Total monthly payment of $403/mo

personalfinance,I missed payments on student loans for multiple months about 7 years ago. What impact does this have on me now and how can I get these negative marks removed?,"I went through years of being unemployed and underemployed after college (my industry got hit pretty hard from the recession). Things have improved drastically now, I've had a steady job making six figures for the past three years and I have my student loans back on track after completing rehabilitation programs. I have one loan being serviced by Nelnet with a 4.75% interest rate, the original loan amount of $20,584 is currently sitting at $29,875. I also have student loans being serviced by Navient with a 6.75% interest rate, and the original loan amount of $30,662 is currently sitting at $49,065. Both of these loans are in good standing and I am overpaying them as much as I can every month.

Looking at my credit report, obviously the $79k in student loan debt looms large. But it looks like there's also some derogatory marks on there from previous student loan servicers. On Equifax, I have missed payments to Mohela from as early as October 2012 pretty much through July 2014, with a couple of months marked as ""Unknown."" On TransUnion, it shows missed payments from September and October 2012, then made payments until October 2013 (with one ""unknown"" month inbetween, followed by missed payments until July 2014. On both it shows that the account was closed July 2014, which I believe is when a new loan servicer took them over.

How much of a negative impact do these large debts have on my credit score? Is there anything that I can do to improve it beyond continuing to overpay them? How badly am I being dinged from the missed payments on my old loans? 

And when will they disappear from my credit report? It's my understanding that after 7 years these fall off your reports, but will they all disappear entirely once I hit September or October of this year? Or will they drop off month by month until it's 7 years from the last missed payment? Is there anything I can do to speed this process up?",finance

personalfinance,“Delaying” student loan payoff due to tax credit?,"I live in a state that provides an income tax credit for a certain amount of student loan payments per month based on year of graduation.

My payment is 290 a month - in the 2 years since I began repayment I have been fairly aggressive for my income in paying them down. Since my payment is below the amount the state will credit me per month for payments, I’ve always just receive my entire state state payment back each of these years. Because I don’t have a STEM degree I can’t claim above what I paid in, so I typically receive about 2000 from the state at tax time and roll over the remaining 1600.

I got married this year and my wife does not have any loans. I will be able to use this credit toward our joint tax payment (probably about 4K), meaning I can use the entire 3600 dollar credit.

I’ve been paying 500 a month on my loans, but this seems silly now, as I can ONLY use the smaller number between what I pay and what the feds require I pay (290).

I just recently finished paying off a large interest rate student loan from undergrad (young, dumb with money, you know the deal). I want to go back to grad school to finish and get my doctorate in physical therapy. Living with my parents right now, and will be saving up to move out next year. I pay them 400$ a month. I make about 2800-2900 a month after taxes as a PTA. I also work a side job where I net another 500 a month. Overall give or take I net 3300-3400 a month. 

Here's where things get tricky. As I am just now getting into understanding finances, I have not opened up a retirement account of any, but am looking at Roth IRA. I have great grades and a lot of PTA exp so even though PT school is competitive, I feel I have a very competitive resume to get into almost anywhere I want. I am looking at a few colleges that cost around 7,000 a semester (competitively cheap compared to you average 12k-20k a semester PT school). If I were to throw a number out there, I figure over the course of a 3-year program, I am dropping at least $60,000. Of course with the cost of living, I am probably looking at anywhere between another 40-60k. I obviously don't want to take out $120,000 in student loans to cover living and schooling while my life is ""on hold"" from making money for 3 years. I know the Roth IRA interest rate example that seems to come up is 8% (again don't really know much about retirement/investing/savings), but student loan interest seems to be around that high for grad school too. My goal for the next year, as I am only paying 400$ a month with my parents, is to save money to throw at grad school so that in turn becomes less money I would have to take out and pay back on a loan. 

I want to know what is the best way to manage my money. I opened an Ally savings account in the mean time to pile most of my income (trying $2,000 a month). How much to put toward a roth vs how much to let sit in a savings account before taking it out for school? Is there a better place than an Ally Savings (2.2%) account to let my money sit?

After all charges, subscriptions, and other financial responsibilities (including my current student loan payments) I am left with around $400-$600 a month of excess cash.

Right now I have my student loans through [Mygreatlakes.org](https://Mygreatlakes.org). I will list out all 7 loans below with current balance and interest rates (All interest rates are fixed):

1. (Subsidized Stafford) $2,387.43 | 3.15%
2. (Unsubsidized Stafford) $1,667.92 | 6.55%
3. (Unsubsidized Stafford) $3,460.78 | 6.55%
4. (Unsubsidized Stafford) $4,405.74 | 6.55%
5. (Unsubsidized Stafford) $3,266.68 | 6.55%
6. (Unsubsidized Stafford) $4,103.13 | 3.61%
7. (Unsubsidized Stafford) $3,985.58 | 4.41%

Set with a default payoff plan, my current minimum payment is $390 over 10 years (from 2015 to 2025).  Due to my financial situation now, I am making payments of $550 a month. I get to allocate where the excess $160 goes by percentage, I am targeting the highest balance with the larger interest rates. The breaks down is as follows:

Total balance to date: $23,277.26

Payment: $550Principal (average): $446.23Interest (average): $103.77

&amp;#x200B;

The consolidation offer is only for my Unsubsidized Stafford loans. So if my calculations are correct, my current balance for Unsubsidized only is $20,889.83 and the average interest rate would be 5.56%.

They were unable to give me a concrete answer on my new interest rate for if I consolidated, but they quoted me around 4.5% interest rate on my Unsubsidized balance of $20,889.83. I can keep my ""Total Pay Off"" date of November 2025, but the monthly minimum prices will adjust accordingly. This also includes  a one-time consolidation fee of $550.

Keep in mind I would still maintain my Subsidized Stafford loan with [Mygreatlakes.org](https://Mygreatlakes.org) which currently breaks down on average (Monthly) as:Unpaid Principal: $2,387Monthly Payment: $48.44Applied to Principal: $42.14Applied to Interest $6.30

My current plan of attack would be to apply in order to least see what I am actually given as an interest rate (not just a quote). I would then compare that to what I averaged out as a 5.56% interest rate that I am currently paying on my total Unsubsidized balance.

Is \~4.5% interest rate on a consolidated balance of $20,889.83 better than an average of 5.56% interest rate on 6 separate smaller balances?

Any advice, insight, or comments are greatly appreciated.

  
Edit: Originally calculated my average interest rate incorrectly, I needed to calculate with weighted interested which is about 5.56%.  


Edit 2:   
I pay an extra $160 a month on top of my minimum payment. You can take a look at my [Excess Payment Preference](https://imgur.com/weMfxtT). My initial understanding was that I target the highest balance with the highest interest rate in order to decrease the total interest I am paying Monthly. So once the balance of Loan 4 (Unsubsidized Stafford $4,405.74 | 6.55% ) decreased to where it was closer to Loan 5 and 3, I would redistribute the percentages. I also thought putting a small 8% towards the other loans would help pay down the overall principal, and therefor decrease the overall interest paid overtime.

If I allocated 100% Excess Pay Allocation to pay off Loan 2 (Unsubsidized Stafford at $1,667.92), then roll that $160+the min payment on the loan I just paid off into Loan 5, and then to loan 3 etc.. I would pay off the debt faster and be saving interest paid overall in the long-run?

Should I, as a principal, always allocate 100% Excess Pay Allocation to the lowest balance with the highest interest rate?

What if 2 loans with identical interest rates are at nearly the same balance? Do I focus one, or split 50/50?",finance
investing,Very low Sharpe ratio of 0.29 for my portfolio. Any comparisons?,"Hi,

A couple of months ago, I decided to do some back-testing of my portfolio. I now went a step further and computed the Sharpe ratio of the portfolio. As you can see on the [simulation website](https://portfolio-simulator.netlify.com/simulation/yoran) I created for it, my portfolio has a Sharpe ratio of **only 0.29.**

However, on [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/010815/what-good-sharpe-ratio.asp) it says:

&gt;Usually, any Sharpe ratio greater than 1.0 is considered acceptable to good by investors  
&gt;  
&gt;A ratio higher than 2.0 is rated as very good  
&gt;  
&gt;A ratio of 3.0 or higher is considered excellent.  
&gt;  
&gt;A ratio under 1.0 is considered sub-optimal.

So a Sharpe ratio of 0.29 is sub-optimal :/. I triple-checked the   calculations and couldn't find any errors. It doesn't mean that there   aren't any, but I was wondering if anyone else had ever calculated the   Sharpe ratio of his portfolio so that I can compare?

## How I calculated the Sharpe ratio

For each year in 1994-2014, I calculated the annual return:

## Annual return

|1994|1995|1996|...|2014|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|\-6.88%|20.83%|9.58%||6.41%|

Then as the risk-free rate, I used the interest on 1-year treasury bonds (from [https://www.multpl.com/1-year-treasury-rate/table/by-year](https://www.multpl.com/1-year-treasury-rate/table/by-year)). I haven't checked the difference when using Federal Funds Rate or 90-day T-bill. Do you expect the difference to be high?

## Risk-free rate

|1994|1995|1996|...|2014|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|7.05%|5.09%|5.61%||0.20%|

Then I subtracted the risk-free rate from the annual return.

## R = (annual return) - (risk-free rate)

|1994|1995|1996|...|2014|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|\-13.93%|15.74%|3.97%||6.21%|

Finally, I took the average of the latter and divided by its standard deviation:

Sharpe = avg(R) / std(R)",finance
personalfinance,"Another ""buying a home"" thread","Hello good people of personalfinance !

&amp;#x200B;

Finance newbie here. I've finished paying off most of my debt. I'm now starting my path into the quest that is buying a home. 29 yo, I'm particularly interested in a condo or similar small place. I'm mainly seeking general advice into how to figure out how much I can afford, and a smart way to save for a down payment given some constrains. Any other useful tips or resources are also very much appreciated!

&amp;#x200B;

Here's some of my relevant background:

* Located in a major Texas city
* \~760 credit score
* My only debt is 10k in car loan (\~4% interest rate). Next payment is due on January 2022 (Maybe not super smart but I've been overpaying - I just now questioned this behavior and learned some stuff around)
* 18k in Betterment investments that I would rather not touch. Currently growing at around 7% annually I believe.
* I get one 8k paycheck per month.
* Monthly expenses sit at around 3.5k. Roughly broken down - 1.6k of that is rent, 1k goes to my above market investments, rest is misc stuff. 

&amp;#x200B;

My apartment lease is up in September. My gut feeling (not a lot of math involved here) tells me I could comfortably afford a \~200k condo. I'd need a 20% down payment of 40k plus some more for closing fees and other related stuff. So lets say I need around 45k

&amp;#x200B;

**My question is, what is the smartest way for me to put together 45k?**

&amp;#x200B;

*Option A:*  Ignore my car loan. Extend my lease 6 months, potentially increasing rent. This gives me \~10 months to save. Aim to save 4k per month. End up with \~40k. Withdraw from my 18k Betterment account as needed for additional fees or unexpected closing expenses.

&amp;#x200B;

*Option B:*  Ignore my car loan. Do not touch my 18k. Extend my lease by 1 year, which would give me \~16 months. Aim to save 4k per month. End up with \~64k and pay more than 20% down.

&amp;#x200B;

Option C: ??????? Something better ?????????

&amp;#x200B;

**The other question is, for this type of short term saving (\~1 year horizon), is it even worth it to invest it? Or should I just keep it in my bank?**

&amp;#x200B;

Let me know if I missed any important details!

personalfinance,Is there a calculator where I can compare which debt would save me more money to refinance?,"Hello, I've made many stupid financial decisions in my life. I'm currently living through one right now. I am in $66,000 in debt. This includes $44,000 for a vehicle loan (with a high apr of 11.99%) and $22,000 in credit card debt spread over 6 major credit cards and 9 very very high interest rate store cards.

I know the avalanche method is usually the best way to pay down debt. Ideally, I would like to re-consolidate my debts with a loan from my credit union. I don't know if i have to get two separate loans (a car refinance loan and a debt consolidation loan) or if everything is done under one big loan. I don't think (given my income and credit history - both are just okay) my credit union will approve me for $66,000. I feel like I have to focus on one debt because I'm more likely to just be approved for one thing or the other - car or credit card consolidation.

With that information, is there a calculator where I can enter all of my debts with their respective apr's to compare which debt I should focus on paying off first? My cc debt mostly has higher interest rates but they're all over the place. For example, on one i have $3,900 at 9%, another has $4,700 at 0% for 18 months, another is $1,800 at 27%, etc) whereas my car loan is lower interest rate but twice as much is owed.

ETA: My goal is to pay everything off in 4 years if I have one big loan. Also, the credit card spending has stopped. I pay for everything now with what I have in my bank account. And I can afford my vehicle, so I'd rather keep it; I just need to refinance so I don't throw away all that money in interest.",finance

personalfinance,Anyone ever taken out a personal loan or other loan to invest and what rates could I expect?,"Let me lead off by saying my risk tolerance is high so please don't try to lecture me about risk and yes, I'maware that it is an aggressive plan.  My concept is to take out a large loan ($200,000-$500,000) over a long period of time (something like a 10 or 15 year loan with a 5-6% interest rate) and invest with the loan.  Now, when I talk about investing, I'm talking about ETFs that average a return of 15% for the last 10 years for the ones I like and even $VOO averages 10% return.  The strategy is to take out a large loan over a long enough period to not be exposed to YOY market fluctuations and while having investment return rates exceeding loan interest.  I have an excellent credit score if it means anything (790). I am also military so I have a relatively secure job if things don't go well with tye option to re-enlist.  Would I benefit by starting an LLC to deal with tax implications?  I believe a home equity loan would be out because I haven't owned my home very long.

personalfinance,Student Loan Consolidation,"I’m considering student loan consolidation purely because I’ve been on a budgeting kick and I’m incredibly frustrated that it’s impossible to calculate exactly how much of a payment applies to which loan since I have multiple accounts serviced by Great Lakes and each account includes 2-5 loans and each loan has its own interest rate and my statements only show a breakdown per account, not per loan. I have a few questions.

1. On the “Considering Consolidation” page on Great Lakes website, under the “What is it?” heading, Great Lakes calls it “Direct Loan Consolidation.” Some of my loans are Direct Subsidized or Unsubsidized Stafford, but the rest are FFEL Subsidized or Unsubsidized Stafford. Are the FFELs still eligible for this consolidation plan?

2. Because I am able to choose Great Lakes as my consolidation servicer, I probably would choose them simply because I’m already set up with log-in information for them and I haven't had any issues with them so far and there would be no bullshit with communicating details to a new bank/servicer. Is there any reason I should NOT do this or any reason that I should consider a different servicer?

3. I already did the math for the weighted average interest for all of my loans (my math used the original value of each loan and not the current value and I’m not sure if that was the right way to do it). My new interest rate would be 4.875% (4.625 if I sign up for autopay, which I obviously would). Is it at all likely that I’d get better deal on interest going through SoFi or someone similar? I don’t expect this answer to be yes.

Bitcoin,Bitcoin - An Internet Protocol For Sound Money.,"For many Gold is the soundest money known to man. It is the high stock to flow ratio of gold which ensures that gold holds it’s value over time. When a gold standard has been applied by a country or nation, peace and prosperity follow. Gold or gold backed money aligns human action, innovation, and labour with time. Allowing humans to store their productive output &amp; mitigates malinvestment. A Gold Standard monetary policy whilst historically supreme, has suffered in it’s practices, as it’s implementation requires trust in a central planning entity to not debase the money.

    Money is, in its essence a technology to optimize human coordination. The design flaw in our current money system is trust. We cannot have trust as a foundational design element in the system when self interest is an innate part of the human experience.

    We must, without force, or violence move towards a monetary system that upholds the highest degree of trust minimization.

    In 1999, American economist and Nobel Prize winner in Economic Sciences Milton Friedman said, when discussing the implications of the internet:

    “The one thing that’s missing, but that will soon be developed, is a reliable e-cash, a method whereby on the Internet you can transfer funds from A to B, without A knowing B or B knowing A.”

    On January 9, 2009 a form of electronic cash called Bitcoin was released onto the internet. Bitcoin is a digital decentrazlied currency. There is no central planning entity behind Bitcoin or it’s issuance. Bitcoin transactions are verified by a network of nodes and recorded to a public ledger called a Blockchain.

   Bitcoin is sound money as an internet protocol. As more and more global citizens connect to the internet in the era of Bitcoin, it is plausible that unprecedented amounts of human capital &amp; innovation shall flourish through cryptographic monetary sovereignty.

Let’s say you have 30k in a savings account that yields 2% annually. You go to buy a car and they have a special 0.9% interest rate when you buy a new car. After all is said and done, the car cost 25k. Although you have the money and they allow you, isn’t it best to just finance it as 0.9% rather than pay it in full? Let you savings interest combat the car’s smaller interest? In fact, you should put zero down if they will allow it.

financialindependence,Starting path to FIRE with newbie question: do we focus growing net worth or passive income faster?,"New here! Want to see what you guys think will help me best and I have a specific question on passive income vs net worth growth.

little background for you first: 

Male, 25 years old, 130k NW. A lot of my net worth is in my house and owned outright vehicles so not sure if I should be counting that or not?  

Married with a kid on the way so expenses are going to climb soon. We both plan on continuing to work. Combined we have a gross income of 150k in a LCOL area.

We have our monthly budget set up to live mainly off the wives income and save my income. Without getting into details, here's high level what that looks like:

&amp;amp;#x200B;

My income: $5,000/mo takehome, $1624/mo to company 401k, 

Wife income: $3,000/mo takehome

Combine tithing/donations: $1,264/mo

This brings **total income to: $8,368/mo**

**Expenses: $4072/mo total**. I can get into the details if requested, but not sure if its helpful to see my budget. Here's some highlights though:

Home mortgage: $1058/mo (have it on a 10 year note at 2.5% APR rate, my father was awesome and let me pull a loan from the bank with his savings as collateral. On these types of loans, they give 2% above the savings account interest rate.)

Other home related totals: $750/mo (utilities, cable, tv, insurance, taxes)

Vehicles are owned outright, so no car payments

Already budgeted for babies in the above expenses. Babies I am finding out are EXPENSIVE - $785/mo for daycare and keeping the poor sap alive

**This brings my savings rate on net income to right at SR = 50%**

The frustrating thing is seeing savings rate on gross income: SR = 33%. How can I get this much higher without tax fraud and without giving up my tithing/donations? 


My big question for discussion: What do you guys focus on with your path to FIRE: net worth growth as quickly as possible and passive income growth as quickly as possible? I have one rental property under contract right now and am starting to see the power of passive income running the numbers on it in that if I work hard at it, my wife and I could replace one of our incomes within five years. Now I know rentals aren't the most passive of passive incomes, but I'll want something to keep me busy during retirement anyways! Curious to hear your thoughts. Thanks!",finance

# **Fed speakers could steal focus from trade war in week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/17/fed-speakers-could-steal-focus-from-trade-war-in-week-ahead.html)**
*****
&gt; A flurry of Fed speakers and any new trade developments could shake up what normally might be a slow week of trading ahead of the three-day Memorial Day holiday weekend.
*****
&gt; Stocks ended the past week with losses, as trade-related headlines caused big swings in the market. The Dow ended the week with a 0.7% loss to 25,764 in its fourth negative week. The S&amp;P 500 fell for a second week, losing 0.8% to 2,859. The Nasdaq lost even more, 1.2% for the week, after U.S. action against China’s Huawei depressed U.S. tech names that do business in China.
*****
&gt; Friday ended with losses in the final hour, after CNBC’s Kayla Tausche reported that talks between the U.S. and China appear to have stalled, and there have been no discussions on scheduling a new round.
*****
&gt; “With the trade stuff, this is brass knuckles time. When you institute tariffs...when you go to 25% like we just did, all of a sudden there’s no room for error,” said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group. “The stakes are so much greater at 25%, and if we did the other $300 billion dollars, then we start damaging the consumer and you can guarantee a global recession.”
*****
&gt; The U.S. raised tariffs last week from 10% to 25% on $200 billion in goods, and China responded by raising tariffs on $60 billion in goods.
*****
&gt; Boockvar, like others, had been looking for a trade deal earlier in the month, but there has been no sign of positive movements, and the crackdown on Huawei raised concerns about China retaliating against U.S. companies.
*****
&gt; “China is not bending and with Trump taunting them, they’re pissed. It still remains the case that everyone wants a deal , It’s in everyone’s best interest. It’s tough to negotiate when you get hit in the head with a baseball bat,” said Boockvar.
*****
&gt; In the week ahead, Fed Chair Jerome Powell speaks Monday night at the Atlanta Fed’s annual conference on Amelia Island, Fla. and there are about a dozen Fed speakers appearing at various conferences and events. There are also minutes Wednesday afternoon from the last Fed meeting, where Powell re-emphasized that the Fed was on hold and it did not see low inflation as a big enough reason to cut rates.
*****
&gt; The market this week began pricing in more than one Fed rate cut for this year, as traders in fed funds futures reacted to some weaker economic data.
*****
&gt; “Whatever message the Fed feels like it needs to get across, they’ll use the minutes to do it. I think they’re really going to pound the table that they’re doing nothing for now. They don’t want to give in to what the market is pricing in, and that’s a rate cut,” said Boockvar.
*****
&gt; Both retail sales and industrial production were weaker than expected in the past week. The coming week is light on data though there are PMI manufacturing data Thursday and durable goods data on Friday.
*****
&gt; Existing home sales Tuesday and new home sales on Thursday could also be an important read on the spring housing market.
*****
&gt; There are a few final earnings reports for the quarter, including major retailers like Home Depot, Target, Best Buy, and Lowe’s.

# Stocks Stand Tall Against Headwinds

&gt; Renewed trade tensions have led to this latest bout of volatility. The recent drop in the S&amp;P 500 Index felt worse because of how quickly it happened—from new highs to down nearly 5% in less than two weeks. Keep in mind stocks have come pretty far pretty fast, beginning with the strong rally at the first of the year that put the S&amp;P 500 back at record highs.

&gt; Swift rallies like this have also tended to lead to drawdowns as stocks typically have lost some steam midyear—hence sparking the well-known market adage “Sell in May.” The stock market was probably due for some volatility. The S&amp;P 500 has averaged more than three pullbacks of 5% or more each year since 1990, and we’re still waiting for our first one this year. “Even though volatility has picked up, and may be with us for a while as risk of a bigger trade war lingers, a pullback or two in the coming months would be totally normal, even with fundamentals still in solid shape,” explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.

&gt; The U.S. economy continues to grow at a solid pace, it’s steadily creating jobs, wages are broadly rising, and some benefits of tax reform and other fiscal spending are still flowing through. We expect a pickup in business investment to help extend this economic cycle. Key risks beyond a full-blown trade war include lackluster growth in Europe, a messy U.K. divorce from the Europe Union, and rising geopolitical risk in the Mideast.

&gt; According to the U.S. Treasury, China has cut its holding of U.S. Treasury securities to a 22-month low, potentially in retaliation as the trade dispute lingers. “What isn’t discussed as much, though, is that global demand remains strong, with foreign ownership of U.S. debt hitting a record high last month,” added Detrick.

&gt; As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, China has been decreasing how much U.S. debt it holds, while Japan has silently increased its holdings for five consecutive months.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/China-Is-Selling-But-Japan-Is-Buying.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Last, we remain hopeful that the United States and China will reach some kind of a trade agreement—or at least a trade truce—in the next few months. President Trump cares about the stock market and the economy, and considers both part of his path to re-election. Both sides have a lot to lose from further escalation. And the two sides already came very close to a deal, which suggests the remaining sticking points can be worked out.

# Pullbacks Happen

&gt; As we noted yesterday, the recent bout of volatility has caught many investors off guard. However, we’ve been saying since late March that some type of normal correction could happen, and we’ve taken a more cautious stance.

&gt; This was one of the best starts to a year ever for equities, which historically has led to modest returns the next six months, with an above average chance of a large correction.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Big-Starts-to-a-Year-Can-Produce-Weak-Results-Going-Forward.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; The S&amp;P 500 Index fell nearly 5% before bouncing back yesterday. Here’s the catch: 5% pullbacks are actually perfectly normal parts of investing. “After a 25% bounce since the lows of December and a near 5% decline, it might feel scary and uncomfortable to investors, but it is important to remember that pullbacks are part of investing,” explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Trees don’t grow forever, and neither do bull runs. A break is usually needed before the eventual resumption of higher returns.”

&gt; As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, there has been an average of more than three separate 5% declines for the S&amp;P 500 per year going back to 1990. Given there hasn’t been a 5% pullback yet this year, we think the odds are quite strong that we see multiple 5% drops the rest of this year as the economic cycle ages and volatility picks up.

# On Again/Off Again Tariffs &amp; It’s a Pre-Election Year

&gt; Even though it has only been a handful of weeks since these charts were last updated and presented, they do put the last few weeks of trading into a broader view. As of today’s close, DJIA is up 9.9% year-to-date. S&amp;P 500 is even better at 13.7% while NASDAQ is still best at 17.9%. Yes, this is down from late-April/early-May highs, but still solid numbers when compared to this point in past pre-election years and especially all years. The recent pullback and the nascent recovery rally could gather further steam and run until early-July (and perhaps challenge old highs again), but from around mid-July until October seasonality becomes a headwind and more backing and filling is likely again.

# Fed &amp; Tariffs Kick Off “Sell(ing) in May”

&gt; Compared to typical May trading over the recent 21-year period, this May has veered off course earlier than usual. On the first trading day of the month, the Fed harshly squashed budding hopes of an interest rate cut and the viewed was confirmed on the second trading day leading to DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ losses on the first and second instead of typical mild average gains. The market did enjoy a brief rally on the third, but it came to a crashing halt as attentions shifted back to trade negations with China. The implementation of 25% tariffs last Friday was initially overlooked, but the realities of the increasing probability of an extended and tumultuous negation process with China (not to mention another flare-up in the Mideast tensions) are hitting the market today. Should the S&amp;P 500 finish the day down more than 1.9%, it will be the second worst day of the year. Only January 3, 2019 was worse, off 2.5%. If mid-May strength fails to materialize, the second half of May could be worse than the first half.

# Next Week's Economic Indicators - 5/17/19

&gt; Similar to equity price action, the first half of the week was a bit rough but things finished on much more solid ground for economic data. Small business optimism kicked things off on Monday stronger than both expectations and March’s reading, coming in at 103.5. Other Monday releases weren’t as lucky as they broadly came in weaker. Export and import price inflation worsened in April and mortgage delinquencies rose. Fortunately, foreclosures fell 3 basis points down to 0.92%. Empire Manufacturing started Wednesday with a bang coming in at 17.8, more than double estimates of 8.0. But it wasn’t all good as retail figures for the month of April were weaker across the board and Industrial and Manufacturing Production fell 0.5% alongside weaker Capacity Utilization. Things turned much more positive on Thursday, though, as every release beat expectations. Claims were stronger, the Philly Fed crushed estimates, and Housing Starts and Permits both rose while also beating forecasts. On Friday, Michigan Confidence rose to 102.4 versus expectations of staying at 97.2, ending the week on a very high note.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/051719-Eco.png))**

&gt; Turning to next week, it will be a light data slate with only 14 releases all week. The Chicago Fed releases their National Activity Index Monday morning; the only release that day. Similarly, Existing Home Sales is the sole release Tuesday. Meeting Minutes for the May 1st FOMC meeting will be out Wednesday afternoon. In addition to the standard weekly releases, we will get preliminary Markit PMIs, New Home Sales, and the Kansas City Fed’s Manufacturing Activity Index on Thursday. Preliminary Durable goods for April rounds things off on Friday with weaker data anticipated.

Any recommend websites? I don't feel like visiting dealerships or banks today. My credit score is 769. I'm trying to stick with the 20% down, 4 year term method, and 10-15% of monthly income.

personalfinance,Advice on how much to allocate toward a mortgage payment vs. discretionary income,"Hi all,

Hoping to get some advice on how much money I should allow for discretionary income (i.e., savings and ""non-essentials"") vs. a mortgage payment (i.e., principal, interest, taxes, insurance). As a note, we are also planning on having our first child within the next year so I am struggling with how to account for that so any advice on how to account for that expense (e.g., childcare) would be helpful. I know that there are tax advantages to both buying a home and having a child but from what I've read online, it's not that easy estimate those advantages.

**Combined Monthly Take-Home Pay (Myself + Spouse)**: $8,000

**Car Insurance + Gas**: $210

**Internet + TV**: $112

**Groceries**: $500

**Electric/Gas/Water**: $200

**Dog (Pet Insurance and Food)**: $86

**Student Loans**: $980

**Childcare and other expenses for a child**: ????

&amp;#x200B;

**Remaining**: $5,912

**Mortgage payment (i.e., principal, interest, taxes, insurance)**: ????

**Discretionary income (i.e., savings and ""non-essentials"")**: ????

&amp;#x200B;

A few additional notes:  
\- The take-home pay is what is left over after our medical, dental, and vision insurance is paid for AND we both have contributed to retirement to get our companys' full match.

\- Student loan is high (I know), but I am avoiding refinancing because my student loans are all federal student loans and I will have them forgiven under Public Student Loan Forgiveness program in 7 years (I have been certifying annually for the program and have received confirmation I am eligible based on my employer's tax exempt status as a nonprofit).

\- No credit card debt and we own both our cars outright.",finance
personalfinance,"Should I keep paying my university tuition and living expenses out of my pocket, or is there a smarter way to use my savings?","Currently, I am an unemployed full-time graduate student who has two years left. I have been working my mid-teens until I started this program. I saved as much money as I could so I could pay for my education without taking loans, and without the need to work.

If everything goes as planned, my saving should pay for the next two-year tuition (I have a good scholarship so there is not much left) and my living expenses. My savings aren’t that much (around 40K).  The only issue I see with this plan is that once I graduate, my saving may be close to zero and without having a job. 

Recently, I thought about the possibility of taking loans and investing my savings. I have never invested in my life but I understand it could be risky. The current interest rate for federal loans is around 7%, so in order to make it worthwhile, the investment should give more than 7%

I was wondering what you guys think, whether this option deserves more consideration or whether I should stick to my initial plan. Additional advices will be appreciated as well. 

Thanks",finance

personalfinance,Received a Super High Medical Bill - Advice? (U.S.),"TL/DR: I received a $200,000 medical bill and make enough money that I am not eligible for financial assistance or charity care. I’m considering options for repayment and would appreciate advice from the community. Thanks!

I have received a bill for a medical procedure I had about a month ago. I was uninsured for the procedure but had saved up a good amount of money. My parents had agreed to help - the procedure was necessary, but not urgent. I planned as well as I could and did my research. 

I made a huge mistake in not getting a specific anticipated cost from the hospital, but I had done my research and everything seemed to be in order.  I assumed the final cost would run around $30,000. I saved $20,000 and my parents offered to help pay the rest and cover me if there were any complications resulting in an extended hospitalization or ICU stay (anecdotally, I understood the risk there to be about $85,000). The procedure went without a hitch and I am doing great - apart from the sudden realization that I have made a foolish and probably preventable financial mistake with life changing consequences. Needless to say, I would have waited or shopped around more if I knew I was in for the bill I got. 

Yesterday I received my bill. It was for just north of $185,000. It was Friday, just after 5PM, when I got to my mail box, so I have not been able to speak to anyone at the hospital/billing department. Naturally, I am panicked and freaking out and have to sit with this until Monday morning (looking forward to a fun weekend).

Last night, my spouse and I ran through all the possibilities and consequences of this  unexpected event. Right now we have determined that we will likely have to postpone having children (at our age that really means forego). My spouse will also likely have to drop out of graduate school and start working. I’ve considered what will happen to my credit/our credit if I am forced to declare bankruptcy if the hospital won’t work with me or I’m/we’re unable to make the payments on the medical debt or my spouse’s student loans (which don’t go away even if the degree isn’t conferred). Needless to say, it’s overwhelming and it’s only been about 18 hours since I first got the “sticker shock.”

I’m never one to go down without a fight, so here’s the options I think I have (feedback welcome and requested):

1.  Call the hospital and verify that the bill is correct:  I’ve never heard of a $200,000 bill for this procedure before and went in with assurances that there is “a very reasonable negotiated self-pay rate.” It’s possible the bill is an error and it can all be resolved with a quick phone call. (Wishful thinking, right?)

2.  Immediately tell the hospital I can’t afford to pay (which I can’t).  This should start the ball rolling for options 3 &amp; 4.

3.  Try to work out a payment plan that I can afford. I have read most hospitals will do this for you and they often offer a 0% interest rate. The challenge here is whether we can afford this payment in addition to student loan payments. 

4.  Offer the $20,000 I have as an upfront cash payment and hope for a discount on the remainder. 

5.  Go back to my insurance company (they don’t cover the procedure) and beg them to cover the procedure. I’m not sure how this will go or if it’s even a viable option. In my head, I’m imagining a scenario where I’ve worked out a payment plan or have paid a lump sum or both and while that’s ongoing, I work through the insurance company’s red tape.

6.  Bankruptcy. I know very little about bankruptcy. At the moment I have the best education Google and Wikipedia can provide. From my limited understanding - Chapter 7 might be a possibility but it’s credit implications are longer and my income may be too high to qualify. From what I’ve read, most of the things I own would be exempt. Except from my modest personal effects and my 10-year-old car, I own nothing except the $20,000 I’ve managed to save.  Chapter 13 would likely work, but I wouldn’t know where to begin. This is really - I hope - a last option for me. I think there are more reasonable solutions. After all, I admit that I am in this position through my own ignorance and failure to ask the right questions - so why should somebody else pick up the bill?

If you’ve read this far, you’re a true hero. Thank you! Looking forward to your thoughts!",finance
personalfinance,I hope we made the right choice dipping significantly into our (small) savings in order to pay off a high-interest loan.,"Hey all, 

My fiancé and I have unfortunately been lacking basic knowledge when it comes to saving and paying off debt. We both grew up in poor to low middle class families and just never learned. Perhaps I should have posted here first before we jumped the gun. Explanation below.


TL/DR: Paid off remaining 4k balance on a 11% interest auto loan. Only had 8k of savings to begin with, now our savings is down to half of that. Hoping to rebuild quickly now that this particular debt is paid off.


We opened up many credit cards in the past and have a few loans out, as well as a mortgage. Because of our bills and idiotic spending choices, we have only been able to keep 8k total in our savings over the past couple of years. We had a baby last year and started taking our finances way more seriously. We opened joint bank accounts. We managed to get a promotional unsecured loan for 3 year, 3.75% interest rate that we used to pay off all our high interest credit cards and purchase a new furnace (ours died just 2 months after moving into our new home.) 


I will quickly add in that we both have good credit.


We are now left with my low-interest (around 3%) used-car payment with about 5k left to pay, fiancé's high-interest (11%) used-car payment with 4k left to pay, mortgage, low-interest student loan with about 5k left to pay. My fiancé also has 1k medical bill he is paying off, using a payment plan of $50 per month (no interest.) Other than that, we have car insurance and a phone bill. No internet or cable since our phones have unlimited data. We pay $240/month in childcare for now. Groceries. I wouldn't say we live paycheck-to-paycheck, but we don't have a lot of wiggle room with our current income, especially since having our (surprise) baby.


I only realized how high his auto loan interest was this past week and my jaw dropped when he showed me.


We talked last night about refinancing his auto loan, but he has already refinanced 2 years ago in order to have lower monthly payments spread over more time when he was on medical leave.


I suggested that we just say ""fuck it"" and pull the 4k from our (8k) savings and just pay it off. So that's what we ended up doing. I plan to take the money we would have used to pay his monthly auto loan minimum ($220) and put it directly in our savings plus start moving a minimum of $100 per each of our bi-weekly paychecks in there. We also bundled our car insurance last week and are saving around $50 a month from that change. 

Hoping we made the right choice. I feel a bit sick that we just ate up half of our savings. Hoping we will be able to rebuild it somewhat quickly. Was this the right choice?",finance
personalfinance,Is it always best to pay off the highest interest first?,"So, I see a lot of people mentioning having debts and focusing on paying off the highest interest one first. Is that always the best practice or are there exceptions? 

For example, currently I have three loans:
1. A car payment @ about 14K. Payment $225
2. Personal loan @ 50K. Payment $490
3. FASFA @ 50K. Payment $100

If I am able to pay off the 14K debt in a few months, is it better to pay that off and then transfer the payment I would be making to that to my other debts? (The $490 payment one specifically as it is the higher interest rate) or dump that 14K on the personal loan? Any advice would be appreciated. Thank you. Also, on mobile so formating might be bad.",finance

personalfinance,I Have approx. $20k in debt... What's the best way for me to get out of it?,"Here are my debt's: 

&amp;#x200B;

$16,300 - $400/mo - This is the payoff quote for my 2015 Ford Fusion Hybrid SE, my interest rate is 8.5%.

&amp;#x200B;

$3,000 - $100/mo - This is approx. how much I owe my dad for college.

&amp;#x200B;

$900 - $25/mo - Credit card, current interest rate at 0%. However, that ends after the next billing cycle and then my purchases will have 25.99% interest rate.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm paid weekly making $10/hr + commission(monthly) working 40 hours a week and have about $400/mo in other bills (ie. rent ($200/mo living w/mom), phone, gas, etc.). I have about another $100/mo going towards savings and then about another $200/mo for spending (eating out, gaming, movies, etc.) I know it seems like I have this all worked out, but I want to know if there's a way I can adjust this or completely change what I'm doing to help me get out of debt quicker. I'm also getting an apartment with a good friend of mine at the end of the year so I know that'll slow things down as well.

&amp;#x200B;

For those wondering how my commission is earned, I work in a car dealership call center. I just try to get people in the dealership on an appointment. If they show up for said appointment I get $5, if they buy a car I sale \* sale and it resets ever month. I also get a $100 bonus for every 10th car sold.

&amp;#x200B;

Example:

&amp;#x200B;

Commission = Show \* 5 + sale \* sale

&amp;#x200B;

$300 = 20 (people that showed up for their appointment) \* $5 + 10 (cars sold on those appointments) \* 10 (cars sold on those appointments) + $100 (extra bonus for 10th car)

&amp;#x200B;

A more realistic example of commission:

&amp;#x200B;

$414 = 29 \* $5 + 13 \* 13 + $100

&amp;#x200B;

This is my commission from last month, which was also my first month. So I'm expecting the ones in the future to be more.

Bitcoin,Bitcoin. An Internet Protocol For Sound Money.,"For many Gold is the soundest money known to man. It is the high stock to flow ratio of gold which ensures that gold holds it’s value over time. When a gold standard has been applied by a country or nation, peace and prosperity follow. Gold or gold backed money aligns human action, innovation, and labour with time. Allowing humans to store their productive output &amp; mitigates malinvestment. A Gold Standard monetary policy whilst historically supreme, has suffered in it’s practices, as it’s implementation requires trust in a central planning entity to not debase the money.

Money is, in its essence a technology to optimize human coordination. The design flaw in our current money system is trust. We cannot have trust as a foundational design element in the system when self interest is an innate part of the human experience.

We must, without force, or violence move towards a monetary system that upholds the highest degree of trust minimization.

In 1999, American economist and Nobel Prize winner in Economic Sciences Milton Friedman said, when discussing the implications of the internet:

“The one thing that’s missing, but that will soon be developed, is a reliable e-cash, a method whereby on the Internet you can transfer funds from A to B, without A knowing B or B knowing A.”

On January 9, 2009 a form of electronic cash called Bitcoin was released onto the internet. Bitcoin is a digital decentrazlied currency. There is no central planning entity behind Bitcoin or it’s issuance. Bitcoin transactions are verified by a network of nodes and recorded to a public ledger called a Blockchain.

Bitcoin is sound money as an internet protocol. As more and more global citizens connect to the internet in the era of Bitcoin, it is plausible that unprecedented amounts of human capital &amp; innovation shall flourish through cryptographic monetary sovereignty.

&amp;#x200B;

||WFC|JPM|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Net Income to Common Shareholders|21.463 B|31.233 B|
|Tangible Equity Value|174.618 B|178.676 B|
|ROTCE|12.3%|17.5%|
|Market Cap|205.391 B|359.282 B|
|P/E|\~9.6|\~11.5|

Berkshire Hathaway had recently increased its stake in JPM by \~20% ( [https://seekingalpha.com/article/4264843-tracking-warren-buffetts-berkshire-hathaway-portfolio-q1-2019-update](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4264843-tracking-warren-buffetts-berkshire-hathaway-portfolio-q1-2019-update) ) , buying approximately 9 million more shares. Conversely, Berkshire sold about 17 million shares of WFC (probably to keep ownership under 10%).

Looking at the numbers of these two companies today, they appear to be somewhat cheap compared to the rest of the market. Especially looking at JPM, with a return on tangible equity at about 17%, it appears to be cheap at the current price. A growth rate in EPS of 3-5% in perpetuity seems to imply an undervaluation of about 20 - 30% at a cost of equity of about 7%. WFC's numbers look don't look as good as JPM's numbers and their net interest income and other income has contracted slightly while costs have risen slightly. Either way if WFC can stabilize growth, it appears somewhat cheap too.

I understand right now due to the flat yield curve and slowing economic activity, net interest income can come under pressure. Also, for WFC specifically, high margin revenues like service charges are getting squeezed. I am just wondering what the bullish case for buying bank stocks right now?

If the FED lowers interest rates later this year, early next year that would improve net interest income. But that would also suggested lowered economic activity. One bullish case I see is that in the next 3-5 years if the economic cycle goes higher again, with a more ""normal"" yield curve, this could be a boon for major money center banks.",finance
personalfinance,"Would my SO, who is the mother of our 5 month old baby, qualify for financial assistance even though on paper I make good money, and we live together?","Here’s the situation. I have own a house, paying the mortgage on it. Last year I rolled some old medical and credit card bills into a personal loan so I could make one monthly payment instead of several, improve the interest rate, and pay it off faster. 

Shortly after doing that the GF who lives me was paying $600/mo to me for her share of monthly bills got pregnant. Halfway into the pregnancy she was put on bed rest, so that revenue stream stopped. 

I could stay afloat until she went back to work but now 5 months after our daughter being born she is only working part time, contributing $0.00 to bills because her own bills eat up everything she makes. 

So I am now paying all the bills, paying for everything pertaining to the pregnancy and delivery. I’m supporting myself, the baby, her, everything. 
On paper, I make a decent living. After taxes and withholdings I bring home about $3800/mo. But after paying all the bills buying food and everything we need to survive, that’s pretty much depleted. 

So my question is... can my GF get some kind of financial assistance? I feel like if we were to apply together then they would say that I make too much money. But she doesn’t make much at all. I figure if we say her rent and whatnot is $600/mo and she can’t afford it she could get some help in that regard? 
I don’t know how it works though since we’re not married, but living together. Note: my daughter has my last name.

It doesn't have to be perfect (after all, we can't know the tax rates for future years yet), but I'm trying to avoid cluttering up my sheet with VLOOKUPs and more.

So far, I've got a fairly simple model, something like this (where D5 happens to be a cell with taxable income in it):

    =IF(D5&gt;0,MIN(9525,D5)*0.1,0)+
      IF(D5&gt;9525,(MIN(38700,D5)-9525)*0.12,0)+

What I'd really like is a simple quadratic/exponential/etc curve fit on the 'real' rates, but Googling doesn't show one.

personalfinance,When calculating retirement figures what do you use as the interest rate?,"Typically the market returns are 10% over the last 100 years or so. Adjusted for inflation is around 7%. What do you guys use as your interest rate when making calculations for retirement?

personalfinance,Pay off debt or put it toward the mortgage?,"This is going to start off sounding like a text book math problem, but here we go. My wife and I currently owe $239k on our home. It’s valued at $350 and it looks like we would get that number if we sold. 

We’re buying a home with my wife’s mom and she’s paying to renovate an attached double garage into an in-law suite. Additionally, she’s putting $200k toward the new house. The new house is $450k. Basically, if we get $350k for our home we’ll have $111k in cash before fees etc.

We currently have $14k (previously $25k)in credit card debt we’ve been fighting to get our from under and $4.5k owed on a car. 


Here is the question. Would you use the cash from the sale of our house to pay off smaller high interest debts? Would you put it all toward the new, much smaller, mortgage?

personalfinance,Pros and cons of buying a home vs. renting when you have a low rent (and thus saving money),"My SO and I are at at a stage where we both have stable jobs and are looking to buy our first home.  We know we are going to be living in this city for the foreseeable future, and are looking to start building equity and being a bit more in-control of our living situation.

BUT, we live in a city where the cost of living is very high.  In order to afford what we are looking for in a *safe* neighborhood, we would likely max out our savings on a down payment and then be paying a mortgage payment of $2000-$2500.  This is within our means, but our current rent is $1100.  We have no other major monthly payments/debt.  With such a low rent (which is practically unheard of where we live), we are able to save a decent amount.

personalfinance,Did the car dealership lie to me and run my credit without my knowledge?,"So I think this is the right sub to post this and I'll try to keep it short and to the point: we were in the market for a preowned car and did our research online. I went to my bank and got preapproved for a loan and my bank gave me the check to be filled out when it's time to close on a vehicle. 

We find and test drive the vehicle we want and start the negotiation and closing process and agree on a price. I inform the salesman that I have financing taken care off. We do all the basic info, and they say they need my social security number just as part of the basic info and assure me that they won't be running my credit. At some point the sales guy asked who I had financed through and what my interest rate was (it was 7%).

When it came time to move on to the financing people, they told me my financing options with other banks, they compared the different interest rates and monthly payments. I was just kind of confused and said I already have financing. They said they are legally required to tell me that they could give me a better deal (don't remember if they said state or federal law or both), and wouldn't I want the best deal possible?

At first I said I'll just use my bank, and they said ""Now why would you want to spend 1.5% more?"" 
It did sound like a smarter choice to go with the lower interest rate, but afterwards I wondered why they were so adamant that I not use my own bank? Did they lie about their ""legal requirement"" to tell me these options? Did they run my credit without my permission? Or can they get preapproved quotes without an actual credit check? What do I do with that preapproval check from my bank?

I just want to know if I got cheated and learn what to do better next time.

btc,PSA: Guide on how to recover your lost Segwit coins using Electron Cash,"# How to get your recovered SegWit funds using Electron Cash

## Background

Thousands of BCH on thousands of coins that were accidentally send to **Segwit 3xxx** addresses were [recovered by BTC.TOP in block 582705](https://bch.btc.com/000000000000000000462698fedbf407a149b8fe0bfa6bb33b11310654ff7765).

This was a wonderful service to the community.  This had to be done quickly as the coins were **anyone can spend** and needed to be sent *somewhere*.  This all had to be done before thieves could get their *dirty paws* on them.


So.. How were they recovered? Did BTC.TOP just take the coins for themselves? *NO*: **They were not taken by BTC.TOP**.    This would be wrong (morally), and would open them up to liability and other shenanigans (legally).

Instead --BTC.TOP acted quickly and did the legally responsible thing with minimal liability. ___They were sent on to the intended destination address of the SegWit transaction___ (if translated to BCH normal address).

This means BTC.TOP did **not** steal your coins and/or does **not** *have custody of your funds!*

But this **does** mean you now need to figure out how to get the private key associated with where they were sent -- in order to unlock the funds. (Which will be covered below).

Discussions on why this was the most responsible thing to do and why it was done this way are available upon request.  Or you can search this subreddit to get to them.


## Ok, so BTC.TOP doesn't have them -- who does?

You do (if they were sent to you)! Or -- the person / address they were sent to does!

## HUH?

The Segwit transactions have a bad/crazy/messed-up format which contains an output (destination) which contains a hash of a public key inside.  So they ""sort of"" contain a regular bitcoin address inside of them, with other Segwit garbage around them. This hash was decoded and translated to a regular BCH address, and the funds were sent there.

Again: The funds were forwarded on to a regular BCH address where they are safe. They are now guarded by a private key -- where they were not before (before they were ""anyone can spend"").  It can be argued this is the only reasonable thing to have done with them (legally and morally) -- continue to send them to their intended destination.  This standard, if it's good enough for the US Post Office and Federal Mail, is good enough here. It's better than them being stolen.

## Ok, I get it... they are on a regular BCH address now. The address of the destination of the Tx, is it?

Yes. So now a regular BCH private key (rather than **anyone can spend**) is needed to spend them further.  Thus the Segwit destination address you sent them to initially was effectively **translated to a BCH regular address**.  It's as if you posted a parcel with the wrong ZIP code on it -- but the USPS was nice enough to figure that out and send it to where you intended it to go.  


## Why do it this way and not return to sender?

Because of the ambiguity present-- it's not entirely clear which sender to return them to. There is too much ambiguity there, and would have led to many inputs not being recovered in a proper manner.  More discussion on this is available upon request.



# Purpose of this guide

This document explains how to:

 - Identify if your coins were part of the recovery 
 - Get private key / seed / xprv for the addresses they were sent on to.
 - Import said addresses and private keys into Electron Cash

Complications to watch out for:

 - Hardware wallets
 - Derivation paths
 - Passwords on BIP39 seeds
 - Multisignature addresses &amp; wallets.

## Step 1: Checking where your coins went

To verify if this recovery touched one of your lost coins: look for the transaction that spent your coins and open it on [bch.btc.com](https://bch.btc.com) explorer. 


#### Normal aka ""P2PKH""

Let’s [take this one for example](https://bch.btc.com/003e54f91903ed7555d96bccda4a50ab91a11c227cdddaf9912fafd5608e38f7). 

Observe the input says:

    P2SH 160014d376cf1baff9eeed943d58551d53c48377adb98c 
    
And the output says: 

    P2PKH OP_DUP OP_HASH160 d376cf1baff9eeed943d58551d53c48377adb98c OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG

Notice a pattern?  

- P2SH 160014**d376cf1baff9eeed943d58551d53c48377adb98c**  
- P2PKH OP_DUP OP_HASH160 **d376cf1baff9eeed943d58551d53c48377adb98c** OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG

The fact that these two highlighted hexadecimal strings are the same means that the funds were forwarded to the identical public key, and can be spent by the private key (corresponding to that public key) if it is imported into a Bitcoin Cash wallet.

#### Multisig aka ""P2SH""

If the input starts with “P2SH 220020…”, [as in this example](https://bch.btc.com/003e54f91903ed7555d96bccda4a50ab91a11c227cdddaf9912fafd5608e38f7), then your segwit address is a script -- probably a multisignature. While the input says “P2SH 220020**19aa2610492ee2c18605597136294596d4f0f9bc6ce0974ed3a975d65da4ca1e**”, the output says “P2SH OP_HASH160 **21bdc73fb15b3bb7bd1be365e92447dc2a44e662** OP_EQUAL”. These two strings actually correspond to the same script, but they are different in content and length due to segwit’s design. However, you just need to RIPEMD160 hash the first string and compare to the second -- you can check this by entering [the input string (after the 220020 part) into this website’s Binary Hash field](https://www.fileformat.info/tool/hash.htm?hex=19aa2610492ee2c18605597136294596d4f0f9bc6ce0974ed3a975d65da4ca1e) and checking the resulting RIPEMD160 hash. The resulting hash is `21bdc73fb15b3bb7bd1be365e92447dc2a44e662`, which corresponds to the **output** hex above, and this means the coins were forwarded to the same spending script but in ""non-segwit form"". You will need to re-assemble the same multi-signature setup and enough private keys on a Bitcoin Cash wallet. (Sorry for the succinct explanation here. Ask in the comments for more details perhaps.)


#### No match -- what?!

If the string does not match (identically in the **Normal** case above, or after properly hashing in the **Multisig** case above), then your coins were sent elsewhere, possibly even taken by an *anonymous miner*. :'(

##  Step 2: How To Do the Recovery

#### Recover ""Normal"" address transactions (P2PKH above)

This is for recoveries where the input string started with “`160014`”.

##### Option 1 (BIP39 seed):
- Import your BIP39 seed into Electron Cash. In the seed dialog select `Options` -&gt; `BIP39` and if you used an extra password, also select `Options` -&gt; `Custom words`.
- On the next page you will need to enter a derivation path:
  - `m/49'/0'/0'` is typically used for single-address P2SH-segwit wallets
- If the wallet was well used and the address has a high index, you will need to use `Wallet` -&gt; `Scan Beyond the Gap`.

##### Option 2 (single key):
- Get your private key. If you are using Electrum on BTC, you can obtain this by right-clicking on the address, selecting ‘private key’, and you will see something like: `p2wpkh-p2sh:Kwt2QPi4GYoDSdtLuQJaqiPt7aP9aMA2vpSaeECsXFkzdfLDDTvr`. Remove the prefix `p2wpkh-p2sh:` and copy just the `Kwt2...DDTvr` part.
- In Electron Cash, you can use `Wallet` -&gt; `Private Keys` -&gt; `Sweep` to spend these funds into a fresh Electron Cash wallet.
- Alternatively, make a new wallet but select “Import Bitcoin addresses or private keys” instead of “Standard wallet”, and enter the private key there.

##### Option 3 (xprv -- many keys):

- Your wallet may provide access to the “xprv” master private key. In Electrum you can access this by opening the Console tab (View | Console) and running `getmasterprivate()`
    - Warning: Keep this confidential as you would your wallet seed!
- If the string starts with “yprv” or something else instead of “xprv”, you will need to convert it. From the Electron Cash console: 

Code:

    mkey = ""yprvAJ48Yvx71CKa6a6P8Sk78nkSF7iqqaRob1FN7Jxsqm3L52K8XmZ7EtEzPzTUWXAaHNfN4DFAuP4cdM38yrE6j3YifV8i954hyD5rhPyUNVP""
    from electroncash.bitcoin import DecodeBase58Check, EncodeBase58Check
    EncodeBase58Check(b'\x04\x88\xad\xe4'+DecodeBase58Check(mkey)[4:])


- The result will start with ‘xprv’ and have the correct checksum on the end. You can import this xprv using `File` -&gt; `New` -&gt; `Next` -&gt; `Standard Wallet` -&gt; `Use public or private keys`.
- If the wallet was well used and the address has a high index, you will need to use `Wallet` -&gt; `Scan Beyond the Gap`.

##### Option 4 (hardware wallet):
- Connect your hardware wallet to Electron Cash, and consult with the hardware wallet’s documentation to find which derivation path you need to use. Note that some wallets may complain about signing transactions on unusual derivation paths.
- In the worst case, you may need to import the seed you have written down, into Electron Cash. Remember though that this compromises the security of the seed, so it should only be done as a last resort.


#### How to Recover Multisignature wallets (P2WSH-in-P2SH in segwit parlance)

This is for recoveries where the input string started with ""`220020`.

Please read the above instructions for how to import single keys. You will need to do similar but taking care to reproduce the same set of multisignature keys as you had in the BTC wallet. Note that Electron Cash does not support single-key multisignature, so you need to use the `BIP39` / `xprv` approach.

If you don’t observe the correct address in Electron Cash, then check the list of public keys by right clicking on an address, and compare it to the list seen in your BTC wallet. Also ensure that the number of required signers is identical.",cryptocurrency

Ok so I read this and it didn't seem right. So I read another investopedia article on relationship between interest rates and inflation.

&gt;  In general, as interest rates are reduced, more people are able to  borrow more money. The result is that consumers have more money to  spend, causing the economy to grow and inflation to increase. The  opposite holds true for rising interest rates. **As interest rates are increased, consumers tend to save as returns from savings are higher. With less disposable income being spent as a result of the increase in the interest rate, the economy slows and inflation decreases.**

ethereum,The value of a successful Hoard game to plasma validators,"After reading the excellent Hoard AMA's and seeing their progress, I got to thinking just how much revenue a triple A game integrated with Hoard could generate for plasma validators.

With that in mind I have knocked together this entirely speculative and just for fun example, based on the data found in the AMAs and a guess on what tx fees may be. I'm going to be fairly specific on this example so it can hopefully be kept in the realms of the conceivable, in terms of value to the developers, who would pay for tx's, gameplay mechanics, etc and of course it will assume the major success of a game title launched with Hoard integration (no mean feat in itself). But in that regard it could equally apply to a collection of smaller, less successful games.

&amp;#x200B;

**Overview**

So this fictional game is going to be called ""Dungeon Raider"", a free to download MMO RPG title which over time has garnered a strong following, the game has many different character types, armour and weapon sets with an ever evolving meta which encourages an active trading community. Fed up of playing a mage? Sell  your gear and kit yourself out as a warrior. Stuck on a particular time limited event or dungeon boss? Sell your ineffective bow for a broadsword, that sort of thing.

Gameplay revolves around character building and dungeon raiding to receive loot, dungeon raids take around 30 minutes and generate \~ 30 NFT loot drops (average 1 tx per minute) over the course of the raid. The loot comprises of XP packs which you can either use on your character (which burns the token) or sell, and in game items of random rarity and quality, which can be equipped, sold, rented out, or even burned.

Over time Dungeon Raider has amassed a player base which averages out at 260000 concurrent players online at any one time. At 1 transaction per player per minute this takes the current capacity of a single plasma chain to its upper limits, processing 4333 tps (stats here derived from Hoard AMA, part 2).

For this game the developers generate income from the NFTs being traded or leased, x% of every transaction of this type would be sent back to the developers indefinitely. For this fictional game I'll leave it at that in order to maximise the fun of looting 😁, but of course in the real world they could monetize it in many other ways.

&amp;#x200B;

**Value to Plasma Validators**

&amp;#x200B;

The $ part...for this example I'm going to use a flat tx fee of $0.001 for NFT's generated on loot drops and sent to players wallet. This would also apply to XP tokens being used on characters (sent to burner wallet).

&amp;#x200B;

Based on 100m tokens staked, this would generate $1.37 per token, per year.

((4333\*0.001\*60\*60\*24\*365)/100,000,000) = $1.366)

&amp;#x200B;

The cost of writing a plasma block to Ethereum, assuming this level of volume, current Eth prices ($250), a gas cost of 40 gwei and 50k gas requirement, would be $0.5. If 65535 txs (approx 4000 TPS) are in a plasma block then plasma tx cost = $0.5/65535 = $0.0000076.  Taking this cost into consideration brings the revenue to $1.356 per token per year.

(Thanks to Thilagavathy for helping me with the breakdown of costs involved with writing plasma blocks)

&amp;#x200B;

In addition to this there would be the secondary markets where items are traded and rented (in this particular example this may end up on an additional plasma chain). There would likely be a mixture of flat fee and percentage fee as the items would then have $ values attached. I'll leave this part alone for this example though as I have no frames of reference, but obviously massive potential here.

&amp;#x200B;

**Cost to the player**

With the tx fees cited above it will cost the player $1 in transaction fees to collect 1000 items, if the players wallet was out of funds they would be able to continue to play but wont be able to collect any loot. At an average of 1 tx per minute $1 would allow close to 17 hours of play with loot collecting active.

In games which are popular and have bustling trading communities, it could prove easy to play for free by trading loot, perhaps games could even have options to auto list items marked by player at market rates in order to keep a players wallet funded, or a similar 'auto sell xp' options. In short, even with players paying for transactions, it could prove easy for them to play at zero cost or even generate a profit.

&amp;#x200B;

In this example I've used a developer who has chosen to have the player take on the tx fees, but a developer could well chose to take on the costs themselves, backing the game with tokens maybe, an interesting subject in itself.

personalfinance,$20k down to $13k in credit card debt. Credit score jumped and considering loan to pay it off,"So, about 7 months ago I was $20k in credit card debt. I've started earning more money and cutting back expenses, I also put my full $2k tax return towards it, and currently have it paid down to just under $13k. This has helped my credit score jump from around 630 to 725, so I now qualify for some decent loan rates. At this pace I think I could finish paying off the remaining $13k by August of next year.

I've been considering taking out a loan to transfer the debt since it would have a lower rate than the CC. Current credit card APR is 15.2%. I qualify for a loan with an interest rate of 5.89% and APR 7.25% (I kind of understand the difference between interest rate and APR but not completely). It would be a 36 month loan with a $380/month payment, no early payment penalties but the minimum payment is higher than what I'd be required to pay monthly on a credit card so if I have a month where I'm a little tighter on cash it would be more difficult. I'd be able to put extra towards the loan most months.

How much upside is there to taking out a loan to save money on interest? What is the downside that I'm not thinking of? I don't have any hard credit inquiries in the last few years so I don't think one would hit my credit score too bad.

personalfinance,What is the upside to adding my wife to my mortgage?,"Some Facts

\-Purchased first home over a year ago

\-I am the only one on the mortgage and have made all payments/taxes/insurance

\-Credit score is currently somewhere between 785-790

\-Interest rate at 3.9%

\-Recently married and wife stated that she wants her name on the mortgage

&amp;#x200B;

My current lender stated that I would need to refinance if I wanted to add my wife's name to the mortgage and am wondering if that is a normal thing? 

I am happy with my current interest rate and refinancing could potentially raise the interest rate since my SO has a lower credit score than myself (720). Other than being a married couple and having both our names on the mortgage, is there any sort of advantage to this to when we file our taxes together for the first time next year? 

Essentially what I am curious about is if there is more of a financial downside that I am unaware of or if it is better to just keep everything as is.",finance
personalfinance,Selling House Post Divorce,"Hello! I am looking for some advice on my real estate situation. I was divorced in December of last year, and currently own a home in Milwaukee in a very ""hip"" neighborhood. I am residing in the home with my two children. My ex husband is still on the loan. The original loan amt. was for 200K with $6,000 down in June 2016 with a 4.25% interest rate. We did not do an appraisal and purchased it directly from the landlord, which I admit is a dumb mistake, because it has become clear we made an ill-advised and emotional purchase (bought it for too much because I didn't want to move out of the house, and we agreed on the price together). I currently owe 188K and my monthly payment is $1496 per month. I have been making payments solely for over a year and have no missed payments. However, I simply cannot afford to continue (nor want to). Last fall I spoke with three different realtors: Realtor #1 said she could list it for $220K, but never saw the house, just went off comps and the area, and said she would waive her fee if I then purchased a house from one of her listings. Realtor #2 (one of the best in the area) said I needed to invest money in gutters, paint, and rehabbing fencing, landscaping, and THEN she could TRY to list it at $185K (and I'd need to then come to the table with approx. 15K, money I do not have, and am reluctant to ask for help from my parents, as I've stubbornly handled this entire divorce and financial situation on my own and want to continue this independence). Realtor #3, my banker's brother-in-law, laughed at me and said he would list it somewhere around $160-170K. When I spoke with my banker he said he would not approve a short sale, and my credit would be ruined if I did that. 

&amp;#x200B;

What do I do? I am reluctant to start investing money and time in landscaping, paint, gutter work, etc. I have an agreement with  my ex that he will be responsible for half the repair work to get the house ready to sell, but he is broke and I would most likely have to sue him for those costs (he is barely able to make enough on his paychecks to keep the child support at the amount it should be- $600/month and it continually is less, as that amount is more than 50% of his income currently). I make 52K per year and just started a new commission-based job with a route history of 56K - 70K; its current employee making in the 70K range. Anything I do to the house, I would literally have to open a credit card with no interest and just \*hope\* I can pay it off without having to pay interest. I currently have 1 credit card with a 10,000K balance that I used during the divorce when I was not receiving child support that will start accruing interest in October and I am just \*hoping\* that I will get approved to open another 0% interest card and roll that balance onto the new card. Basically, I cannot afford both the mortgage and all the bills associated with the house, and it is becoming a huge drain on me emotionally to put all of my income into this property that I was effectively abandoned in. The emotional toll is huge and I would like to start renting to relieve myself of the responsibilities of maintenance, lawn care, etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

Should I contact a different realtor? Try to invest in the house in any way to get it to list so that I can walk without having to come to the table with money? Just list it at 200K and hope for the best? I am getting conflicted advice. My banker tells me to wait a few years and continue making payments, and while that is probably the best financially, I also need to take into account my stress levels/energy. I would like to rent, so that I can be free of the cost of repair and maintenance. The area I live in is ""up and coming,"" and house prices continue to rise. 

&amp;#x200B;

My credit score is around 670. Any advice/thoughts would be entirely appreciated. Thank you!",finance
personalfinance,I'm about to have enough money saved up to pay my 50k student loan off...but it will deplete my savings...good idea or no?,"Graduated with 80k in loans, been paying 900-1200 a month since I graduated, and now I'm at roughly 50k left (4.4% interest rate). Next month I will have enough money to pay off my loan in full, but I'll wipe out all of my savings if I do it. That being said, I'll still have my emergency fund untouched and roughly 5k in my checking. I currently don't pay rent (living with parents) and they've told me they'll support the decision and let me live rent free for another year or two.

Does this make sense to do, or does it make sense to put more towards the monthly payment and pay it off in two-three years?


Side Note: Savings account interest is terrible, I get less than a dollar in interest every month. It's just something I opened when I got my first job to have a place to save money...so its doing me any good there.",finance
personalfinance,"The sub wiki and my own research say that paying off higher interest student loans early is more beneficial than the low interest ones, but my mom disagrees.","She says that I should pay off lower interest rates first. I'm not sure why, that just seems illogical since the big rates are gonna cost me much more over time.



She might have meant that since the handful of lower interest loans are for small values $3k-7k and the two larger loans I have are at double the interest rate but also about $20k a piece, I should just completely eliminate the many small ones so the interest doesn't ALSO accrue while paying off the larger ones early. This makes some sense.



Based on that assumption, what do you guys think?  Should I focus on the two $20k high interest loans, or knock out a couple of the many low interest $3-7k loans first since they're smaller?



Keep in mind at some point in the coming month or two I plan on refinancing the high rate loans if possible.",finance

personalfinance,Help with Refinancing,"I am in the military and was recently gone for an extended period. Upon returning, I had more than 10 offers in the mail to refinance my home. I live in Southern CA and used a VA loan to purchase my property. My current interest rate is 4.125%. I have owned the home since Feb of 2018. I owe 446k on this home. It would appraise for somewhere between 460-500k.

The offers vary in interest rate and benefits, some range from 3.25 to 3.9%. Others have a cash out option, no closing costs etc.

The one that really caught my eye was one which stated, there are no closing costs, no fees, no VA funding fee etc. They claim the lender pays for everything. The interest rate is no higher than 3.75%. This seems like a great deal, I get to lower my monthly payment, and don't have to pay anything to do so. I am no super interested in the cash out option, but open to exploring it.

personalfinance,Military - Buying vs Renting a house at my new PDS.,"Hello everyone I will try to keep this short; I am an (going to be) an E-4, 3 years in, 25 Y.O. and will be transferring to my new unit in Connecticut soon. I am recently married and my first child is due in November this year. My wife is a (legal) immigrant and currently does not work as we're still getting green card in order.My financial situation is a follows:

Savings:

- $20,000 in savings accounts

- About $3,500 in TSP High three (not BRS)

Debt: 

- Around $32,000 in federal student loans currently on the PAYE plan at $42 a month, not covering interest - planning to use the 10 year PSLF program.
- $4100 auto loan for my 2006 Altima with Navy federal at 2.2% APR
- No credit card debt

Monthly Budget:

- $5,932 income after taxes and TSP
- $2,160 in total bills not including rent (includes savings to take a yearly trip overseas to see the in laws)
- Anything left over after rent goes into savings

Our BAH for the area will $2,925 a month; and we have seen multiple listings online of houses for about $1,500 to $1,800 for 2 BR and around $2,100 for 3 BR (not really needed).

Since I'm just moving to the area this first year I plan to rent probably a 2 BR home for around $1,700 a month which will leave me with a monthly budget surplus of about $2,222 a month. I haven't entertained the idea of buying a home too much because I saw my parents lose their house in the recession and just get screwed overall so I'm a little skeptical of home ownership and I don't want to go for some overvalued house that will lose value. However, my wife looked up 3 BR homes in the area and there are some really nice looking houses for about $160,000 to $190,000 (most I would ever want to pay for a house). I used one of the VA home loan calculators and with my 750 credit score and history and even with $0 down, it looks like my monthly mortgage payment with financing fee, insurance, and taxes would be about $1100. Of which about $700 is principal and interest. This is of course a $1000 a month savings to a similar home rental.

My insecurity comes in when it comes time to PCS again. My billet is 4 years and if I buy the house after 1 year I would have 3 years left before PCSing. I am not keen to renting out a house across the country as its too much of a liability for me and prefer to just cash out at PCS time and try to sell. I am not some crystal-ball guru or anyting but my gut rells me we're coming close to another recession/downturn/bear market/etc etc whatever you want to call it and if that happened I imagine houses would come down in price. I feel afraid that I buy a house for $190,000 and when it comes time to PCS I can't get more than $140,000 for it due to the economy.  This is what happened to my parents and I don't want it happening to me. One of my petty officers told me that the VA loan has some sort of ""insurance"" or ""protection"" where if you have negative equity on the home and you are PCSing, they ""forgive"" the portion that you are underwater on (in this case the $50,000 I didn't get in the sale). I can't find that ANYWHERE though so I imagine its BS.

Furthermore I don't hope for it but I've been having health issues recently that may or may not affect my ability to stay in/reenlist but that in the worst and most unlikely of scenarios. It's something that makes me think though.

What are your recommendations? If I can sell the house for the same or more than what I bought it I could get back a lot of what I paid in mortgage as well as save more of my income which would help me to reach that $100,000 in savings goal that I have.

I appreciate everyone's advice.",finance

Bitcoin,"What tonight's ""60 Minutes"" piece on BTC will be about. ( Basically, FUD )","It seems tonight's piece won't be a super supportive piece, but more on the misinformed/slightly negative side, unfortunately.  They will be interviewing the guy that bought pizza with BTC and comparing his purchase then, to BTC's price now (silly).  Then speaking to someone at the Fed who will be trying to warn people about BTC and how it's not backed by governments or have deposit insurance.



&gt;At the end of a volatile week in the stock market, ""60 Minutes"" examines the even wilder financial world of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. The story, reported by Anderson Cooper, includes the first television interview with the legendary ""Bitcoin pizza guy,"" Laszlo Hanyecz.
On May 22, 2010, Hanyecz traded 10,000 Bitcoin for some pizza in what is widely believed to be the first real-world transaction involving Bitcoin. Each year, on May 22, Bitcoin enthusiasts all over the world celebrate ""Bitcoin Pizza Day"" to mark the event. Bitcoin then was worth less than a penny.
Hanyecz, a computer programmer who lives in Florida, told Cooper he made a number of other trades after the pizza. In all, he estimated that he spent 100,000 Bitcoin on a number of items, much of it on pizza. At the time of this interview, one Bitcoin was worth about $8,000.
""That's $800 million,"" Cooper says. ""You spent about $800 million on pizza?""
Hanyecz replies, ""Well, if you look at today's exchange rate.""
""Are there nights you wake up,"" Cooper asks, ""where you think, 'I could have had $800 million… if I hadn't bought those pizzas?'""
""I think thinking like that is… not really good for me,"" Hanyecz says.
Cooper's report includes interviews with Federal Reserve Governor Lael Brainard; Neha Narula, director of the MIT Media Lab's Digital Currency Initiative; Marco Streng, the CEO of Genesis Mining; and Charlie Shrem, one of Bitcoin's first millionaires and also one of its first convicted felons.
Bitcoin is a digital computer-based currency that is not backed by any government or bank.  Its records are maintained by a global network of computers known as ""mines,"" and its value is based on the free market.  It can be bought and sold for dollars through businesses called ""exchanges.""
For the ""60 Minutes"" report, Cooper visited a cryptocurrency ""mine"" in Iceland. He also visited the Federal Reserve in Washington D.C., where Brainard warns investors that cryptocurrency is much riskier than the U.S. dollar. ""The Federal Reserve and ultimately the U.S. Treasury stand behind [the dollar],"" says Brainard. ""And when you hold your dollars in a bank account, you have deposit insurance… None of those accountability mechanisms exist for Bitcoin.""

personalfinance,Understanding and dealing with quarterly taxes for my business?,"I have held an LLC for roughly 10 years. I am a sole proprietorship essentially, no employees. 

Over those 10 years, I usually make income of roughly $6,000 or less. It's just extra money I use to cover medical expenses, bills, etc... 

I always have set aside into a savings account roughly 25% of each check I get meant to pay for taxes come the next year.  Thing is...my federal refund from my full time job has always been enough that when I enter my 1099-Misc forms into my tax software, I still get left in the green.  For example, my federal refund from my W-2 might be $1500.  After entering my 1099 Misc forms, it drops down to roughly $400, or something.  Then after my deductions, donations, etc.. I might get my federal back up to $1000.  But point is, I do enter my side business income and that tax appears to get 'paid' by the government giving me less of a refund. 

however I have never done quarterly taxes. 

This year, I am expecting to work on a side project that will pay me more money, roughly $9,000, along with my typical $6,000 ish...so my side income could be $15-18k this year.

I'm a 28 year old man with a wife and child living in Indiana and I've got a considerable amount of debt from school (~ $58k @ 3.2 - 6.5 %) and credit cards (~ $15.2k @  13.2 - 26 %) and my wife also has a considerable amount of debt from school (~ $42k @ 3.2 - 6.6 % ) and credit cards (~ $11.6k @ 17.5 - 27.2 % ). Our child is just over 1 year old now and the cost of child care seems too high and my wife's earning potential too low for her to work and send our child to daycare. So, essentially, all of our debts are resting on my shoulders.
We've made some lifestyle changes (wife takes care of baby at home and we've moved in with family to cut out rent and associated expenses) to get things back on track and things are going well. We are making ends meet and I'm actually pretty happy considering, but I want to make some real progress
Fortunately, I recently got a promotion and am now making ~$44k/year and this has opened up more money to make more than just the minimum payment on our credit card debt and despite my low income there is great growth potential in my field (biochemistry) and I could be making significantly more within the next 2 years (in the range of $65-$72k/year).
I've taken an honest look into our finances and debts and with the way things are right now I could pay off our credit card debt in the next 3 years and then make some headway on our student loan debt as well. If I'm eventually able to make enough to cover daycare my wife may even be able to return to the workforce and make progress in her field as well (fashion merchandising). My only issue is that this seems like an eternity away and keep in mind this means sticking to our bare bones budget and living with family into our 30's.
I've begun considering allowing my wife to file for bankruptcy on her credit cards. This was her idea and I said no because bankruptcy scares me. I'm not sure what it will mean for our family but it could also mean a great deal more money could be directed towards paying off my own debts and us possibly buying our own house sooner than later.
There's a few things to keep in mind here (listed below) and if you have any questions I'll try to answer. Any advice would be greatly appreciated and if you have any other tips for making progress on my debts please share them. I'm on mobile and out with family at the moment so I'll try to keep up but might be delayed in responding.

More about us:
- All of our credit card debts are in our respective names and not joint accounts. We do have two joint checking accounts and savings accounts (that's 4 accounts total). Is the money in these accounts the money that would be surrendered if she files for bankruptcy? It's not much so I'd honestly be okay if the trade is whatever is in there for her debts.
- I have a 401(k) (~ $5-7k, not completely vested yet), and a 529 for our daughter (~$400). Are either subject to garnishing? My name is on these.
- I don't think I'll be able to afford a down payment on a home for at least another 3-4 years. How would a bankruptcy for my wife change things?
- Is this a stupid idea? Am I just being impatient and just need to make peace with the fact that this is going to be a long road to debt freedom?
- Outside of our banking accounts the only considerable assets we have are our vehicles (2013 Nissan Sentra SV w/ about 60k miles for me and a 2006 Hyundai Elantra w/ about 125k miles for my wife).

Things I've done:
- Reduced student loan payments to just interest payments for me and IBR for my wife which brings her to $30/month in payments.
- Have not done this yet but I will be calling our credit card companies and asking for a 0% interest rate. Or, possibly a repayment plan which closes the account and brings the interest rate to 0%",finance

personalfinance,Trip Report: Refinancing w/ an Internet Lender,"All,

&amp;#x200B;

About a year ago I wrote a post asking for advice for my home purchase.  I had a pushy in person loan person who had worked with my realtor trying to advise me not to go with an online lender I found on Bankrate which had a better rate.  He used every excuse I can possibly come up with try to and dissuade me from going with them.

1. The rate they are quoting isn't legit, they will change it
2. What if something goes wrong?  How will I get in contact with them?
3. They're just going to sell the loan.  What if I don't like the new company?
4. Rinse, repeat, etc.

I won't lie, I put a ridiculous amount of thought into this decision, and decided it was worth the peace of mind to go into the loan for 30 years @ 4.75%.  (we have premium credit, this was literally the top of the interest rates before they came back down...lucky us).  The loan went through just fine.  Yay for in person loan person.  Yay for us.

But I kept watching interest rates and saw they were coming back down.  I knew it would be difficult, but if I could get to 4%, I figured it might be worth the effort to refinance.  I'd cut 150-200 out of my payment, save a ton on interest, and I would be low enough I probably wouldn't ever have to worry about doing it again.  So I went back to Bankrate, and the same bank was offering some rates around 4%.  I e-mailed the loan officer and we ran the numbers.  The experience was so amazingly positive, it drove me to write this post because I wanted people to know about it.

For starters, the people I dealt with at the internet lender(I don't think I can post their name?) were absolutely fantastic.  They were responsive.  They had a great internet portal so I could watch the numbers as they moved.  My loan guy helped me negotiate with the title company to get those fees down.  My processor updated me every single step of the way.  When the appraisal came back a little higher, the loan guy got back in touch w/ me to make sure I got the exact correct amount of money put down / financed.  It was simply perfect in every way.  And we closed for 30 years @ 3.865% in &lt;24 days.

The APR never changed.  Every time a number on the loan sheet changed for even a dollar it e-mailed me so I could see it move and ask questions.  They were ultra responsive, never taking more than a few hours to answer an e-mail.  And guess what...the in person loan company sold my loan to Wells Fargo.  The internet company?  Also Wells Fargo.  The same login even works.  So that was a moot point.

I guess my point is....  I can't promise every lender and every loan officer is going to be as awesome, but the majority of my concerns were a non-issue.  The idea of saving almost a point of interest on a 30 year loan saved you tens of thousands of dollars.  Here is one, totally advertisement free, person telling you that it all worked out just fine.",finance
personalfinance,What is considered a good APY% offer for student loan refinancing?,"Hello! So I'm in the middle of applying to Earnest to refinance my student loans, and they so far offered 5.06% fixed rate with my credit score being around 698 (my age of accounts is the only thing holding me back-- I never had a late or missed payment). I am enticed because they don't have a penalty for prepayment and the option to refinance more than once later down the line. For cases of emergencies, they also allow one missed payment every 12 months.

This rate of 5.06% will be better than the weighted average of my federal loans (5-7%) if I do direct consolidation, and I feel confident that I can pay it off in about 7 years or so.

What do you think? Or rather, I'm curious what others have been offered when they refinanced their student loans and what companies they went with. Should I keep looking? Let me know if you need to know more about my situation. Thank you!",finance
financialindependence,Is this too risky? /BaristaFIRE,"Hi,

I am thinking of BaristaFIRE'ing next year and yes I have always been a bit of a risk taker but here is my current scenario and my current plan. I guess my real wish is for my husband and I to quit our jobs and be able to explore starting our own business or working in less stressful jobs. :

&amp;#x200B;

**Current Scenario**

\- Earning $125k, Husband earning $104k

\- $145k in Shares/ETFs

\- $15k in cash

\- $200k in 401k/Superannuation

\- Fully paid off $550k value house

&amp;#x200B;

**Plan:**

\- Use equity in house to borrow 80% out being: $440,000:

\- Put another $50k into super (concessional cap - means I get a tax deduction)

\- Purchase 3 cash flow positive properties (160k 10% deposit &amp; other costs?)

\- Add 230k to shares/ETF

\- Save up 120k in the next year and then add 75k to cash &amp; 45k to shares/ETF

&amp;#x200B;

**In one year's time:**

\- 4 cashflow positive properties with loans (current paid off house will be cashflow positive even with loan)

\- 250k in super

\- 420k in ETF/Shares

\- 90k in cash

\- Quit work and go volunteer/work/holiday in south east asia region

\- Live off 4% dividend return from ETF/Shares: $16,800. This equates to $1,400 a month. Rent in SE Asia on Airbnb is around $420 a month. That leaves $980 a month for living expenses  ($233 a week) which is quite sustainable. If not, maybe we could do some volunteering, teaching English, husband programming

&amp;#x200B;

**If we have kids:**

**-** come back to Australia for free medicare/healthcare &amp; family

\- Reallocate funds into paying off one of the properties so that no need to pay rent and look for some easy/low stress work

\- worse comes to worse, there is a good social welfare system

&amp;#x200B;

**Real retirement age (60 yrs old) in 27 years time**

**-** According to compounding, super/401k should be just over a million (assuming 7%growth). After 60, can start drawing from super/401k tax free

\- Properties should have doubled in value and hopefully the rent would have risen substantially. This means I can sell the property to access the equity, hold and keep the rental income or I don't know if refinance is possible after retirement?

&amp;#x200B;

**Risks:**

\- Interest rates currently 3.99%. If interest rates go up alot, may not be able to afford repayment on loan. However, do have savings/Share dividends in cash to cover

\- If properties cannot be rented out. I am targeting properties close to the city that have low vacancy rates. At least I will still have alot of cash as a backup. If they really cannot be rented out for very long periods of time, like over a year, then I would be in real trouble and have to go back to work?

&amp;#x200B;

Is it too risky? I am really keen on this plan but at the same time there is alot of risk. But I figure that the worst case scenario is that we will both have to go back to work. Maybe I need someone to talk me out of this!",finance
personalfinance,Personal Line of Credit Interest Rate,"Hello, 

I have a personal unsecured LOC with CIBC that initially had an annual interest rate of 7.95%. I used this LOC to improve the cash liquidity of my small business and felt that the interest rate charged was fair for the conveniences that it provided to me but I did make sure to have the means to immediately pay it back if required. 

Recently, I have checked my bill and the LOC interest rate has increased to 9.95%. Instead of Prime (3.95%) + 4%, I have been adjusted to prime + 6%. How do banks make such decisions to increase the adjustment factors? I have never missed a payment and I am a long-time customer. Can I negotiate my situation?

Wondering if anyone has opened a new CC that was zero interest for X amount of time and no fee balance transfer in order to help save money on interest to pay down the actual principal on a CC?

I have a Chase card that has a 23% interest rate and I am paying in interest alone about $240 a month, balance is about $13k. I also have a Discover credit card that has a $10k balance and interest is around $135 per month. I just can't afford to be paying some much interest!  Was thinking I could open a new CC that would give me 15-18 months of 0% interest and no balance transfer fees so I can pay down this craziness faster. It's mine and my husband's debt and we are both going to pay towards it.

Open to all advice. Thank you!

personalfinance,"Credit card debt, great income increase, want to optimize my payoffs","I just got a new job and paychecks are coming in. I have 31k in debt across credit cards with varying balances in:

* Citi (3) : 9k debt , high utilization, 20+% interest
* Chase (2) : 16k total debt, 60%+ utilization 24% interest on 1, promotion 7% interest on another, both 8k balances
* Boa: 2k , but only at 15% utilization, 20ish interest
* Barclays: 4k, high utilization, 22% interest rate

total: 31k debt.   
I just celebrated the paychecks on my new 130k per year job and tried to lower utilization on 4 of the cards. 

I made payments of 1k to chase, 1.5k to citi because it'll affect my utilization more on two of those cards, and 500 to barclay for utilization purposes. I still have 4k across two different checking accounts, neither of which accrue fees.  


This 130k salary job is secure and taxes are for Los Angeles, CA residency. I have 1.5k in upcoming large expenses (a nonnegotiable international flight for two that I need to book) and no other debts. I have no credit card offers for balance transfer at a lower fee available right now.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a few questions:  


1. Could I reduce this debt by a % by calling the CC companies or going through a third party in a way that will not negatively affect my credit score? If there is a negative effect, how much would be expected and for what duration?
2. What payment plan will most quickly get me back into the 700+ score? I'm currently at 624 TU and Equifax
3. I have a 12k lump sum expected this week, how should I proportion the % that doesn't go to taxes (its from recent 1099 work in California)

I'm trying to be most efficient in my debt payments. Right now I'm burning a few hundred per month in interest fees and I'd like to stop that financial idiocy that I've been carrying for a year and a half now.  


I'm not looking for advice like selling stuff to make more money, I can just wait 6 months and have this paid off, but I'm trying to get rid of some of this debt as efficiently as possible.  


I have a degree in finance and was willing to pay these exorbitant expenses to support some insane travel for a while because I knew I could get a job earning at least this month within a couple weeks of searching because my work experience unrelated to finance is in very high demand.",finance

personalfinance,Can’t go back to college,"I was going to Rutgers Newark after graduating highschool in 2017. I should’ve never went there, my sat score was 1510/1600, but I applied in May of my senior year probably because I was afraid I wouldn’t get in anywhere good. Anyways my dad always refused to fill out the fafsa and I hadn’t talked to my mom in about a year at that point. Anyway, freshman year came around I was going to classes and stuff but never had any loans or anything. Then second semester class registration came along and I couldn’t register because I had a balance on my tuition. 

At this point I’ve called my dad every day first semester and he always said he would get it done and then he never did. When classes started second semester and I still wasn’t registered I begged my dad to come down to financial aid with me and figure out some sort of loan situation. I had already been talking to a financial counselor at that point and she told me my dad need to bring his 2016 W-2 or something along the lines. He didn’t, but regardless the counselor got some information out of him and I was able to take out about 4K in federal loans, enough to let Rutgers believe I could take classes again. 

Summer comes around and I owe the school 30k in unnamed debt. I’m begging my dad to fill out the fafsa for the next year and assigned all the other money I owe the school. He promises and promises and it never happens. I went to the school right before the beginning of the semester after emailing the financial aid office all summer and I speak to a lady who lets me sign up for classes even though I still owed money and put everything owed all onto my second year balance. By the time the second semester started this year I had bought all the time I could and my school started ignoring me. I would schedule meetings with a financial counselor and they wouldn’t show up and I’d have driven an hour and a half one way for no reason. They wouldn’t respond to my emails or calls until finally they sent me an email saying there was nothing they could do and it’s all up to me. 

I was depressed as fuck and felt helpless. My dad told me the reason he never filled anything out was because he thought I was trying to trick him into paying for my whole/half education. Now I can’t go to school and I owe them a bunch of money. My dad gave my car away to my sister while I was at school during the first semester this year, so I took out a car loan and got a 2012 vw Jetta with 88k miles. I’d bought other cars with no loan before and they always break so I thought this was a responsible decision. The loan has an interest rate of 25.6% which I know is awful but I felt like I had no choice because I couldn’t work anywhere with no car and I felt like I could refinance it when my credit was better. I took out a discover credit card and have been using it for gas and food and stuff. Car loan was like 6.5k total. I owe Rutgers around 40k now and the government 4k. I’m working hvac in the city with a small company (2 owners and me) the guy before me got into the local pipe fitter union after around a year. I want to go back to school and finish my degree ( around 1 more year because of ap credits) but I don’t know what to do anymore. I started talking to my mom and maybe I can set up fafsa with her? And then maybe with some better credit and after I pay off my car I can take out student loans with discover or Santander(car loan bank)? I don’t know I feel like I need help, I’m only 19 and I have to figure everything out myself. Nobody helped me apply to school or helped me get my first job when I was 15. I bought my first car when I turned 17 and when I totaled it with only liability I bought another car. I have reached the end of my abilities I think, I need Reddit’s help. What’s my next best move? What can I do to get back in school? All help is appreciated, I love everyone, thanks!",finance
personalfinance,Took a new job and suddenly saw a 50% increase in taxes,"Hi all,

So as the title says, I started a new job almost a month ago and have since received two paychecks.  From my previous job I was earning on paper about 68k but it varied due to a profit sharing program.  My new job doesn't do this and I earn a flat 90k per year with a chance of a 10% bonus based on my departments performance.  I believe this is paid out at the beginning of the fiscal year but I'm not sure since I haven't been there long enough.  Either way, it was roughly a 22% payraise.

So, onto details.  I have always been a ""0 withholdings"" kind of guy.  I'm married to my wife, no kids, we own a townhome, and are otherwise financially independent apart from some medical bills, my wife's student loans, and a car were paying off.  We're not struggling financially so I won't list the details there.  However my wife is making about 25k a year, so all in all we are making roughly 115k a year with a possibility of an extra 9k.  We live in Utah, USA if that's needed.

So at my new job, once again I put 0 on my withholdings but my federal income tax went up *dramatically*.  I'm talking to the point where it literally seems like I didn't even get a payraise at all.  The benefits aren't quite as covered at my last place, but the numbers come out that I'm spending probably an extra $200/check on benefits from my last job (I am putting away 8% into my Roth, insurances and FSA contribution come out to around $270 per check.  We didn't go the cheapest health plan, and I'm thinking next year we will transfer to a high deductible plan which supports an HSA if the numbers make sense to do so).  At my last job, my total taxes were around $600/check, and at my new job, my total taxes are around $900.  As the title said, a 50% increase.  Oh, I feel I should also mention that my new job pays biweekly where my previous job paid always on the 5th and 20th.

It is expected to see the taxes increase, but by *this much*?  The pay checks I receive now literally are about the same as my last job.  I know there are ways to cut back (I am putting $1200/year into the FSA), and the premium for my health insurance is about $190/check.  I am comfortable so I'm not touching the retirement contributions.

What can I do for the withholdings though?  I've tried using a calculator online but they want so much information I can't give them.  My wife doesn't have stubs that she brings home regularly so I don't know how her pay breaks down, I started a new job so that makes things extra complicated for calculating that.  I put in the numbers to the best of my ability from my previous job and this job and it said I should put a 6 for my withholdings but that seems way too high.

Is there an easy rule of thumb to follow with withholdings?  I just feel a bit ripped off since I left a job I loved in order to climb the pay ladder.  I did it for other reasons like career growth and what not, but I'm still quite disappointed I haven't seen the several hundred dollars a month that I initially calculated.",finance

personalfinance,First primary residence (condo) future investment options,"Not sure if it belongs more on REI sub, but wanted to fine tune my thoughts on what all to consider in the near future. Before jumping onto buying new properties strictly for investment/income, I wanted to focus on how best to use what I already have. 

- Bought first home a year ago, a condo in a pretty good suburb of Atlanta. Only put 5% down on it, and currently standing at a whopping 6.5% equity. Thankfully PMI isn't terrible at $80/month. At current rate, I should hit threshold to remove it in about 7 years. Though not as low as current rates, financed for 30 years at 4.375%, so I'm not sure how much good refi down the line would be when considering extra costs to do so. (Side note, paying it off quicker isn't an option because of staggering student loans, which need to go first). 

- Original (before notions of any REI entered my head), and still current plan, is to stay here at least a few more years. Going to renovate something major each year: HVAC, master bath, kitchen. Although these will somewhat be done with intent of upping value, the main motivation is simply to just have an updated home and bring happiness. 

- My amateur outlook assessment. Zillow is suggesting our value has already gone up by 9%, which I think is too generous. A recently sold comp in same community that is identical to my home suggests value has actually gone up by around 5.5% in past year.  There are other communities popping up within a mile that are going for over 100k more than my 10 year old home. So, hopefully the future is bright, but I can't take that for granted.

- So option 1 for future: eventually move out, and use it as rental property (yes, I checked with association, and they allow it to be rented out). Drawback is the $215 HOA, but it minimizes capital expenditures to worry about, esp since planned renovations will address big items and be clear for the long term future. Do need that PMI gone so it won't eat into monthly cash flow. It's a 2 bed 2.5 bath, so could def look at 2 tenants or ideally a family. I honestly don't see much net cash flow potential, but could at least count on appreciation and having someone else pay down mortgage. 

- Option 2: stay long term, continue to acquire capital and/or find other means to get into REI while just continuing to live here. 

- Option 3: if it appreciates enough, sell. Take profit and use as down payment on new primary resident, and this time have a better monthly payment due to larger down payment and no PMI (depends on future interest rates of course). 

- Option 4: having browsed and listening to BP lately, use condo to BRRRR since I would have already done the rehab part, and kinda plan on renting anyways. Could also consider HELOC here since I'm not sure how much refi would help unless it has appreciated a good bit in 5 years. 

TL;DR - I just want input, thoughts. Point out better ways to use my current situation, or tell me me I'm missing key points in my plans. Thanks! (And please, telling me what I ""should"" have done a year ago won't help since I don't have a time machine)",finance
Bitcoin,The bitter pill to take,"This is the way I see it: as much as we don’t want the feds involvement in the cryptocurrency market, it may be a bitter pill that we have to accept.  Sure, the regular stock market is regulated and there is still manipulation, but there are still protocols in place to control them....some are better than none at all.  This is why my mom and neighbors invest in the stock market.  Because there is some degree of protection and this makes them feel safe enough to put their hard earned money into the stock market..  Think about it, if bitcoin is to replace fiat, it HAS to be accepted by the common masses.  People will NOT throw their hard earned money into a device that is unstable and unregulated because of manipulation by the wealthy whales and because of scams in an unregulated market.

personalfinance,[18] Retirement plan --short term -- long term---,"Hello, I'm currently having a mental battle with my self about my Roth IRA investment. I've decided that I want to start a Roth IRA account with Vanguard, but the idea of not being able to touch that Money until I'm 60 is scary.

* Current interest rate is 2.50% / 2.53% APY1
* $25 minimum opening deposit and required balance
* Dividends compounded daily, paid monthly
* No charge to open or service2 the account
* Monthly statement
* Contributions not required
* Recurring Funds Transfer available for contributions

Should I get both IRA plan? one for short term (5-15years) and the other for long term(60)? I'm aware of the contribution cap. I don't care to maximize long term because I feel as though i'm starting at such a young age that I will have more than enough built up by the time i'm 60. I'd like to invest more short term to be able to withdraw it without penalty and have a great amount for my first home purchase and such.

personalfinance,Save for home or pay off debt.,"Hi all,

My husband and I recently sold our house and had about 77k given back to us as part of the profit. We paid off my private student loan of 44k and now I still have about 40k to go. We are currently living with my parents, and thankfully have a good relationship with them. We have a toddler and probably another one hopefully soon. Our biweekly checks vary a little bit since I have a side-job as an independent contractor, but this is the breakdown. We also just paid off our credit cards and both have excellent credit.  


We would really like to eventually get a house in about the $150k range. Thankfully where we live isn't very high cost of living. That could afford us what we need - 3 bedroom, 2 bath, etc. But we would really like to put a nice chunk of change down on it - so ideally 30-40%. However, if we pay down our debt first, this would mean we wouldn't be affording a house in the near future and would likely be waiting until our kiddo is in kindergarten. And while living with my parents is going well right now, that seems like such a long time to wait and intrude.

&amp;#x200B;

Income: \~4k

Loan payments: $640  
Childcare: $600  
Car loan: $250 (super low interest rate so not looking to pay that off right now)

Entertainment subscriptions: \~$16

&amp;#x200B;

personalfinance,"Car engine failed, still have 7k left on the loan. Best move for two broke grad students?","Its been a pretty awful week; I (26M) picked up my girlfriend (24F) on the side of the road after her Elantra crapped out on a major highway only to find out its totaled. She's only had it a year, and GAP and her insurance will not cover internal engine failure. We both have massive student loan debt and it will be a while until I am bringing home money (med school). We've recently moved in together after 5 years of dating, which should help with rent expenses. Within a year she will have to start paying back her student loans, but she will start an internship in 2 months paying 30k/yr. I have federal and plus loans that leave me with about 10k a year after rent, my parents are able to help here and there.  


We are trying to weigh our options here. We contacted a nearby dealer who said we could rollover into another loan and they will cover this title, the monthly cost would go up from 170/mo to 300 - 400/mo. This would mean we would at least have a car, and we would need to tighten finances. This idea is attractive because the cars are certified pre-owned and come with a warranty, because we don't want this happening again. We both need our own car next year. 

&amp;#x200B;

My dad said that we should consider having the bank repo the car and taking the credit ding, claiming that banks may avoid going after the loan in court, and choose to settle for much less. I don't like this idea but am not sure if it makes financial sense. I don't want her to damage her credit in case we need both on a mortgage.   


I don't know if this helps, but my family has an extra car we can use, but I've been holding off on because my current car likely wont make it much longer. But this isn't attractive because it doesn't help us deal with the 2000 pound potato in the room.

personalfinance,Seeking professional help to fix financial issues...,"Need some financial advice here, and willing to go to a financial/tax advisor if necessary, or if affordable.

TL:DR - Student Loan debt plus years of delinquent taxes. Need help wading through this mess and getting back on track. Advice needed on what type of financial advisor I should be looking for?

First off... I am absolutely terrible with money, as you will see. Also, my wife is no better, so no help there. We make a decent living (~$90k combined gross, yearly) for where we live (Cincinnati Suburb), so I am confident that we can right this ship, with some help. Not only are we bad with our spending habits, but I have Student Loan debt that is now being garnished and also a large tax burden that is thrust upon us. I realize that this is all my own fault, so I am not looking to blame anyone. I am genuinely trying to get this fixed. I just need help. I need someone I can sit down with and go over every aspect of our finances. However, being where we are financially, I probably can't really afford much. I just want to make sure I go to the right type of person and not be gouged or ripped-off, but that can still provide the assistance I need. Also, hopefully I can find one person/company that can help me with every aspect. More details below, if interested.

1. Delinquent Student loans: I have paid little bits on these here and there over the past 20 years or so, but always just enough to get them out of default. Then something would come up, or the auto-draft payments would stop for some reason, and they would get ignored (by me) for years until the cycle would start over. They have finally started to garnish my wages. I want to see if I can stop this garnishment, and setup a more reasonable automatic payment plan. No idea where to start with that...

2. Last year, we received some money from an inheritance. Not a huge amount, nothing life-changing, but enough to take a few trips and buy some appliances and other household improvements. Moronically, we ended up spending the majority of it on those things. For some reason, I forgot/neglected to set some aside for tax purposes. Now, we need to pay the tax on this, and no longer have enough to left to cover it.

3. In 2012 we moved to a City. Prior to this, we never lived within city limits, so due to total ignorance of the tax laws, we have just now discovered that all this time we should have been paying city taxes. Neither of us work in the city we live in, so no Local taxes were ever taken from our paychecks, only Federal and State. We even bought a house in this same city in 2016, and this never came up in all of the credit and background checks that we went through for that process. My wife received a letter in the mail last week informing us of this (I still have not seen one arrive in my name yet), and that we need to file for the years 2013 through 2017. 2018 too obviously, but this was just focusing on the delinquency of the 5 previous years. No mention in the letter of 2012, although we were just part year residents that year.

Prior to these last 6 months or so, I had a pretty good system setup to auto transfer money to an account that auto-pays all bills, with a little cushion to provide some wiggle room here and there, and I have been working on increasing our credit scores (went from the 500's to the 700's so far). Now though, that wiggle room is gone. The system still works and we are not missing any payments at this time, but any little thing that comes up, like an emergency room visit, or a car accident, or some kind of emergency maintenance on the house, and we'll be screwed. Or already screwed, I guess, with the tax issues above...

Any advice for the type of financial advisor or company that I need to seek out, or which ones to avoid? I know I could probably figure all of this out for myself, but my track record is clearly not very good, so I think we need some professional help.",finance
personalfinance,Should I pay off my student loans early or keep on course?,"Hi! Obligatory sorry for the long post.  


tl;dr: should I pay off my student loans early?  


A bit of background: I refinanced my graduate student loans with Earnest back in July 2017. The minimum monthly payment was not a problem (actually a bit less than when they were federal loans), but I had just started a new job with a higher salary and made an effort to overpay each month - for a few months I was paying about 1.5x per month, and for the past 8-10 months consistently I've been paying almost 2.5x per month. Obviously, this has been great - and my projected payoff is now in January 2020! (If I payoff on that date, I will have paid my loans off in 6.5 years vs the full 10.)  


My partner and I share the majority of our expenses, but we do keep a bit separated too, even though I manage most of our finances. We pay separately on things like our cars (when I still had a payment), my student loans, spending money, haircuts, and general medical eg flu shot, dr appointment, etc. That's all probably going to change one day when we're married, but that's how it is for now. For emergency funds, I currently save them as 2 separate funds (probably worth rethinking) - I have a ""me"" emergency fund, which is calculated to cover if I lost my job, and that fund currently has about 4 months of emergency savings in it. I also have an ""us"" emergency fund which is calculated to cover if we both lost our job, and that has about 1.5 months of savings in it.  


So, here's my question. If I take the ""us"" fund and apply that toward my student loans, along with a bit I have saved up from my bonus this year, I'll have them paid off by next month (!). I could then put my monthly student loan payment directly into the ""us"" savings, and build it back up to where it currently is by the end of the year.  


I know the interest on my loans by not paying them off until the current overpayment date of Jan 2020 will only end up being a couple hundred or so (4.21% rate) - but I'm balancing between paying them off or not. Anyone have any thoughts one way or another? And, is there any negative to paying them off early - will it hurt my credit at all losing that account?  


Thanks for any insight. :)",finance

personalfinance,Student loans vs. exhausting trust,"I am going back to school very soon. My family is currently managing funds left to me in approximately the amount needed to fully fund my degree and living expenses. I can either fund this degree with loans and thus spare the nest egg, or avoid loans and graduate debt free but without any meaningful savings. This is the basic choice requiring your wisdom.

Some maybe relevant details.

The approximate cost of the program + estimated living expenses is ~$150K. This is also (I'm told) close to the total funds being managed on my behalf, which I will hereafter refer to as the ""trust"". I have very little information on the status of the trust and zero personal access to it, but I am told that it is not growing significantly in value, and can readily be made available for educational costs. Let us assume the trust will not change in value during at least the time I am in school, other than potential deductions for educational/living costs. I realize the potential growth of the trust may influence the best course of action, but I have little if any control over its management. (I am happy to hear advice about how such a sum should be invested, but I have basically zero knowledge about investments (see username), and feel that topic warrants another post entirely.) I expect loans to be roughly 1/3 federal  direct unsubsidized, and 2/3 private. I am still awaiting a specific loan offer from the school. The program will be 2.5 years in length. I expect to make at least ~$130K/year after graduating, and anticipate relatively prompt employment given current demand in the relevant field. Whatever debt I have after graduating, I plan to pay down as aggressively as possible. I currently have no significant savings or investments, and am debt free.

personalfinance,Refinancing: 30 year vs 15 year,"Hello everyone. I've seen this asked (via searching) but to be honest mortgages and everything involved gives me a headache so I wanted to get a more direct answer to my situation as nothing I pulled up was a good fit (which probably just means I missed something).

I'm just going to give basic details because current bills and such are not a factor in this question.

As of right now we have a $65k (remaining) mortgage and our house is valued at $130k-$140k. Our current APR is 7.25% (high, I know). We purchased the home in 2008 just before everything went kersplodey. Current monthly payment (principal+interest+taxes/etc) is about $760 a month.

I know right of the bat we can get a better interest rate, however doing some rough remortgaging calcs I noticed something interesting in the difference between 30 and 15 year:

We can have a rough payment of $325 (at 4.6% APR) for a 30 year or roughly $480 (at 4.3% APR) for a 15 year. Either would be a huge savings, though of course sticking with a new 30 year would be more savings. Our goal is just to reduce the payment as much as possible, however that 15 year is tempting.

We have no plans to move, we do like our home. Biggest complaint is lack of space (however we have spoken about using some equity to put an addition on our home, not too much as we don't need a tone more space) but we're pretty happy where we are and don't forsee moving any time soon.

personalfinance,"Question on how fast a car purchased used (2 years old) will depreciate, in regard to the need for GAP","Hi all.  First post here. I'm in the southeastern US.  

Recently purchased a nice used Nissan Rogue (2017) with 23k miles for a purchase price of $22,327. We financed 100% through Nissan as they offered a $450 rebate off the sell price for doing so, but at a less-than-great interest rate. I'm planning to instantly refinance with my personal bank for at least a point less interest, and am also planning to put about $5,000 onto the loan (hence only borrowing about $18,300 or so on the refi). My reason for doing putting down the cash, outside of having a smaller payment and saving on interest, is to be able to drop the GAP insurance.  

So I'm trying to calculate, using a loan amortization table and a car value depreciation estimate, whether it is truly safe to be without GAP insurance. The information I'm using for depreciation is that a new car depreciates about 20% in the first year, and then 10% every year after that.  

My question is this: While I realize there are infinite variables at play, generally speaking does a USED car also depreciate 20% in its first year?  I would think not, since the whole point of buying a used car is to save on that first big chunk of depreciation. This car, roughly 2 years old, and with lower-than-average mileage for a car that age, would probably be close to $30,000 if purchased new as it's a fully loaded model. The car was purchased ""certified"" through a Nissan dealership.  

Taking for granted that the car will be well maintained and that an inordinate number of miles won't be put on it, do you think I'm relatively safe to simply assume just a 10% rate of depreciation per year, including specifically the FIRST year?",finance

solar,[SolarEdge] Is there any way to get the inverter (SE6000) to work with an unsupported battery? (Possibly using Venus GX?),"Hey guys

I've been looking everywhere but I can't seem to find any information about anybody getting the SE inverter to get with any unsupported batteries. Has anybody gotten this to work?

I saw somebody suggest using a Venus GX to somehow get it right. Is it possible to ""spoof"" a battery's RS485 modbus communications going to the inverter? Perhaps the inverter's battery support list isn't locked down? The communication between the battery and the external interface module make use of RS485 MODBUS serial comms using the SunSpec energy storage specification. How do I know which version of they're using as well as which addresses/events they're communicating? See [here](https://sunspec.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SunSpecInformationModelReference20170928.xlsx). See index: I think what I'm trying to do would fall under the 803/802 model but I'm not sure which one LG is using. I can't seem to find it online. 

Is there a chance that I can just get a battery pack with a BMS which supports SunSpec RS485 and plug it into the interface and call it a day? I haven't seen anyone online mention this - let alone *try* it.

The SolarEdge battery interface (StorEdge S2) costs £870 and it's a small plastic box with a basic-looking PCB in it. If the solution I proposed for battery-compatibility is possible, would it be possible to get the GX to completely remove the StorEdge interface as well? What does the module do? Does it possibly only relay the battery's modbus data to the inverter and vice-versa - I wonder if it even does anything to the data (e.g calculations) it receives or if it just passes it straight on? The same thing goes for the DC-in plugs.  Does it regulate current/voltage? It must do something really important because, in my opinion, SE is really reasonable when it comes to their add-on products. I think it could possibly be an over-voltage protection which is set dynamically based on how much solar is being produced as the total voltage coming from the solar and battery cannot exceed 1000v.  There is a picture of the PCB [here](https://www.solaredge.com/sites/default/files/storedge_interface_installation_with_LG_and_HD_wave.pdf) on page 30. If it is possible to use the GX to replace the interface, I have the same question regarding the comms as the inverter's comms: How do I know which version of they're using as well as which addresses/events/models they're communicating?

It's weird: VenusOS has native support for all SunSpec communications models except for 8XX (Batteries). I have no experience with the OS but I'm sure there is a good reason they do that. If I understand correctly, this is just for receiving data and you can't send data on the bus using it.

All latest SunSpec documentation: https://sunspec.org/download/ - You will need to create an account, unfortunately, but once you have that direct URL it doesn't check if you are logged in when trying to download it.

**In a nutshell: use a Venus GX to receive SunSpec data from my unsupported battery and then forward it on to my inverter ""spoofed"" as if it was an LG Chem battery.**",energy

financialindependence,Cash Management Strategies,"Looking for feedback regarding the following cash management strategy:

  
**Background:**  
Currently (for various reasons which I don't want to detail here) I am holding roughly 10% of available assets in a mixture of VMMXX, US Gov't I-Bond, and cold hard cash (in a savings account yielding 0.01% - ew).

&amp;#x200B;

Ideally, I would have only \~10k in a checking account, then the remaining in some form of low to very low risk, highly liquid *investment* which at very least keeps pace with CPI. Until recently, interest rates were terrible enough that Money Market / CD / TIPS / I-Bonds pretty much all sucked and weren't worth spending too many brain cycles on. Some or all of this money can or will be spent within the next \~5years.

&amp;#x200B;

My thought is something along this distribution:

|Fund|Percentage|Current APY|FDIC Insured?|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**High Yield Savings** |20%|2.2 - 2.35%|Yes|
|**VMMXX**|40%|2.45%|No|
|**1y CD Ladder**|40%|2.7%|Yes|

&amp;#x200B;

**Questions:**

1. How much of a PITA is the CD Ladder to manage? Is this worth the hassle? Any automated tools which handle this?
2. How much ""Value"" should I place on the FDIC insurance of the online savings?
3. Have there been any historic events which have caused liquidity issues on a VMMXX type fund? Anything to worry about here or should  I just go 100% VMMXX (obviously that would be simple - and simple is good).

&amp;#x200B;

I am curious about what others are doing with their cash funds...  I realize I'm talking about a small percentage of allocation, but I am an optimizer.

However, after reading over and over the terms I wasn’t too sure what they mean, the terms say 10% fed tax and no state tax (I’m in TX) plus an additional 10% fee for withdrawal before I’m 50 but the actual contract said 20% federal tax and it doesn’t show a 10% penalty fee. Will that penalty be taken from the amount remaining in my 401k? Or will I just receive a lower amount in my check than what was requested, also why does the tax change from 10% to 20%?

personalfinance,"Have $450k after a house sale, what next?","Throwaway account for obvious reasons. My wife and I built a home back in 2013 and just sold it for around $800k. We put a fair amount down to build the house and it appreciated quite a bit so this week we'll end up with a check for about $450k. The reason why we sold is that we had moved to another town and have been living in a nice rental condo with good schools. The rental is costing us $2,000 per month. Now that our house sold, we've been looking at buying a house in our new city and the houses we are looking at are between $600k and $700k. However, over the past week we've been considering just staying in the rental for a year or two. We think we might be on a real estate bubble and think that the market might cool off over the coming months. Maybe if we wait a year or so, we can pickup that $600,000 house for $550,000? 

&amp;#x200B;

We want to put the $450,000 into an investment that we can access quickly should the perfect home come on the market sooner than a year. Any advice? Additionally, since interest rates are low, we plan to only put 20% down when we do purchase a house. This would amount to somewhere between $100k and $150k. We would add the remaining amount to our retirement savings which currently is at around $250k. We are in our early 40's and live in the midwest.

You can withdraw the money anytime, and it seems way better than any savings account in terms of interest rates. Below are my simple calculations


Bond apr = 5%
5% of 240 = 12
Every 240$ invested dollars at 5% is 1$/month 
If I invest 480$ a month it grows by 2$ 
2$ increase/ month = 14$ increase /year 
14$ increase over 5 years = 70$/month 

240$ every two weeks for 5 years= 70$/month

Can you think of any reason why it might be a mistake to invest using this app? (Worthy)

financialindependence,FI at 41 and struggling to transition,"For the past 18 months I have obsessed over spreadsheets with FI scenarios. We are there, but I’m struggling to commit to a transition.  My patience with customers and willingness to put in the necessary hours is evaporating.

I’ve had a job since I was a 6th grader with a paper route.  Worked through college, started a IRA at 19.  Now 41, married, kids, SO is stay at home and works about 10 hr / wk on admin for our small business and rental properties.  I love my career, subcontractor, creative field, events at locations throughout the United States.  My plan up to age 35 was to continue into my late 50s. At age 35 I was diagnosed with a medical issue which is slowly reducing my mobility.  I’m working to scale back my work commitments in 2019, last week I failed, 84 hours worked 7 days.  I have this week off, but the cycle is typical, with schedules and scope outside my influence. It’s a young persons trade, I’m aging out.

We own a small portfolio of rental properties. The plan is to relocate to the rental market, we already own our FI house there, currently occupied by a tenant.  Here is my thinking this week, deploying the 72T SEPP.  It would be a 17.5 year commitment to correctly withdraw and file every year. I would do so in one transaction per year.  Discussed with my accountant and a fee-only financial adviser, I’m confident I can manage the core requirements for the timeframe.  I’ve been using quickbooks for 21 years.

&amp;#x200B;

**FI Income** **scenario**

58,000   rental cashflow before taxes

38,000  72T IRA 950k balance (a 17.5 year commitment)

15,000  3% of 500k in a brokerage account

111,000 / yr gross income.

&amp;#x200B;

Taxes are interesting, not sure I’m estimating correctly.  Rates appear super low.  I used this calc. [https://smartasset.com/taxes/income-taxes](https://smartasset.com/taxes/income-taxes)

**Taxable Income**

29,000  Rentals 58k less depreciation

38,000  72T, IRS tax only, no FICA, no state income tax

\-5,100   Federal income tax, effective tax rate 7.34%15,000  Draw from 500k brokerage account.

\-2,250  Capital gains rate of 15%

103,650 / yr Net Income

&amp;#x200B;

**Expenses**

16,800  PITI retirement home (presently own as a rental), 142k mortgage bal @ 4%

8,400  Health Insurance ACA

12,000  Groceries

4,800   Dining Out

6,000  College Savings

34,000  Everything else (itemized available)

82,000  Total Expenses

21,650  Amount remaining to reinvest, 20% of gross income

\*  data from detailed spreadsheets, totals rounded.

We could draw down the 500k brokerage account for a few years before starting the 72T SEPP.  At the moment I’m favoring the guarantee of 38k year + 500k brokerage account available to invest in future RE properties.  The 72T amortization calculation is a fixed annual payout per year, no inflation adjustment.  However, the rental income will track with inflation and the 500k will outpace. Once the dependants are through college our expenses will reduce.

personalfinance,Can I pay off an outstanding tuition bill with a personal loan?,"Hello,

This is my very first post to Reddit and I’m recalling this story to the best of my ability so I apologize in advance if anything is amiss. 

I am a New York State resident who attended a SUNY school. My last semester was spring of 2015. During my last semester my FAFSA was audited by the federal government which required my tax information, my parents’ tax information as well as their tax transcript from the previous year. According to the school, since they are a state school, every other year the federal government audits 20% of the student population’s FAFSA information. I provided my tax information and my parents their tax information except for the tax transcript which had to be requested through the IRS. Long story short,  my parents didn’t get their tax transcript to me until mid-late August 2015. 

When I called the school’s financial aid office to provide the tax transcript they told me that they had canceled my FAFSA because I had not accepted my rewards so I was now responsible for the tuition bill of that semester. I was not able to accept those awards because my FAFSA was on hold due to the tax transcript not submitted.  Shortly thereafter the bill was sent to the Student Recoveries Unit at theAttorney General’s Office in Albany. I made two $180 payments to them in January and February 2016 then was unable to continue due to personal issues. 

Now that I’m in MUCH better financial shape and those personal issues no longer exist I would like to start paying it off so I can return to school. (My transcripts are on hold because of this.)  My question is could I apply for a private loan to pay off this tuition bill or would I contact the Student Recoveries Unit and resume my payments? My tuition bill I owe is around $5,500 with interest about $7,000. 

I look forward to any advice. Thanks!",finance

My understanding i that if this criteria is met, you do not pay state tax on interest if you live in California, Connecticut, or New York. If my understanding is correct, i have the following question:

The ""*\*\*""* applied to one of the funds I held and earned interest on, and I am included in the states that it mentions. I did all my taxes (fed and state) on vanguard through the auto import after logging in on turbotax's site with vanguard log in.

Installment loans also don't really affect your credit if you pay them, at least that's my understanding of it.

So why should you ever put a balance on your cards? Aside from really dire emergencies where you need a large sum of money right away, and in that case is there ever a reason to not take out a loan as soon as possible to pay off the card?",finance

I need a way go invest short term, so I can get the money at any given time (vacations, and might want to buy a car end of next year).
So a bank account or smth like that would be good. What interest rates are good and where can I get them?

Another part I would like to invest long term to buy a house. So not being able to get to that money for 5/10 years wouldn’t be a problem.

We are designing jobs in central and northern california and hot bus are becoming more common and for the life of me i cant get the backfeed rule working in ny head i feel like im makeing this harder than it needs to be.

Gonna use 200A panel as example

Interconnecting on a center or end fed main with a 200A bus/200A main i have 40A backfeed

 interconnecting on a hot bus with a 200A buss and a 200A sub feeder breaker i got 40A back feed.

Problem im having understanding is.

Inter connecting in a sub panel. If i have a 200A bus with a 200A sub feeder breaker that goes to a 225A bus sub panel. Am i suing the 225A x 1.2= (sub feeder breaker) + (backfeed) in this case giving me 70A of back feed or is it the same as above giving me only 40A.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions

The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

personalfinance,Smartest way to take out Graduate Student Loans,"Hi all,

&amp;#x200B;

I am going to be pursuing an MBA (evening program) and I was lucky enough to get into a top 5 program. Now it's time to actually figure out how to pay for it. I did some of my own research, but wanted to come on here and get some more advice or tips and tricks on how to take out this large sum of money in the smartest way possible!

&amp;#x200B;

A little background: Credit score is 805, 0 current debt, will be working full time while pursuing my MBA (I plan on making payments while in the program as best as I can), I am confident the program will help secure a higher paying job post graduation.

&amp;#x200B;

I filed my FAFSA already but I know for Graduate programs you can only get $20,500 in public loans per year at the lower rate so I was thinking the private route to help make up the shortfall. I know you can take out more public loans a 7-ish percent interest rate but that seems high to some private loans out there. I'm expecting the total cost to be roughly $120K when it's all said and done in 2 years. One additional note, if I pay by credit card the University absorbs the credit card fee, so if anyone is aware of a private loan that would disburse funds directly to me I would love to rack up some serious credit card points ha! I know that point is moot if the interest rate is greater than the percent back I get in points but wanted to toss that out there.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm happy to provide any more details that I left out if it helps determine best lenders to choose, etc. My main ask is this, what are some of the best lenders to consider? What is the best way to take them out, as in just request the likely full amount I'll need from them up front or should I break it up into a couple smaller loans (my apologies if this is a dumb questions, I was lucky enough to have help with my undergrad so have not taken out loans alone before)? Are there lenders that will disburse directly to the student (from initial research seems like a long shot)? 

Thanks for the help in advance!!",finance

personalfinance,Looking for some advice on paying off a mountain of Student Loan Debt (which will ultimately qualify for PSLF),"I'm looking to develop the best payoff strategy for my mountain of student loans, some of which qualify for Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF).

&amp;#x200B;

I have 7 loans totaling $111,153.23 @ about 6.6% (I say ""about"" because 2 of the loans are 7.65% and 5 are 6.55%) in PSLF-eligible loans.  They are serviced by FedLoan.org and I'm currently at 60 out of 120 qualifying monthly payments (I never miss a payment).  Once I hit 120, the remainder is forgiven.

&amp;#x200B;

I also have 2 loans totaling $34,477.96 @ 6.55% in non-PSLF eligible loans.  The Estimated payoff of these, according to the site, is October 2027.  These are also serviced by FedLoan, and their payments are lumped together with the others for 1 monthly payment.  They just happen to not be PSLF-eligible.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm currently on the Income-based repayment plan, however my monthly payment is pretty darn close now to what it would be under standard repayment.  I pay $1959.43 a month.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a few questions.  Is it worth my while to pay *any* of these loans off early?  Even the higher interest ones?  Or should I just keep paying the absolute minimum I can until they are forgiven?  Additionally, the 2 loans that don't qualify, should I pay them off now, or wait until after the rest are forgiven and pay off the last 2 then, when the principle balance will be lower?  I should add that even if I pay off some of the smaller loans, my monthly payment doesn't change.  Rather, the ""extra"" money just goes toward the remaining loans.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not very good at calculating loan amortization, so I don't know if it benefits me whatsoever to pay these down faster if they're just going to be forgiven in 5 years.

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice?  I can provide more info if needed.",finance
personalfinance,What should I do with an unexpected 25k?,"Hi all, long time lurker, posting from a burner account.

So long story short, I have about $25,000 (after taxes, don’t worry I’ve already budgeted that) coming to me that I wasn’t expecting. And I want to use it to repair my credit. My credit is in the low 600s. No credit card debt, no delinquent accounts (anymore), it’s almost all because of low available credit and my student loans.

I have not had great luck with steady employment until recently, so I have had to spend a lot of time in forbearance. As a result, my 27k in loans ballooned to 40k over a few years. I also have a few missed payments on my record from not managing the loans properly. I have 3 loans between 10-15k, and 1 loan that’s around 5k (which happens to be my oldest line of credit). They’re all federal, so the interest rate is 6.8%. I can’t refinance them because my credit score is too low. I am currently making payments of about 500 a month, which I will keep doing regardless of what I do with the 25k.

I also have a car that I’ve almost paid off. It’s about 6k away from being mine. Monthly payments are around 350.

So I was thinking the first thing I should do is pay all my loans down to at least the amount they were when I received them. Which would cost about 15k. The rest of the 10k, not so sure. 

Should I pay off any of my individual student loans completely? Should I pay off my car and increase my monthly student loan payments to 850 a month? A combination of those two?

Thanks for your help!

If it matters, I’ve got a bit of a savings account that I contribute to as I can, so I don’t feel like the answer is just throwing the money in a savings account, but obviously I’m not a great financial mind, that’s why I’m coming to you.",finance

personalfinance,First job ever; newly financially independent with tax questions,"I never had to claim any taxes in the past as I was under my parents household during college and had zero income.

&amp;#x200B;

Starting July, I have a full time job set where I will be making around 57k a year before tax. I am single, no dependents, and don't have any itemized deductions currently (Atleast I dont think so). I tried to read the schedule A form but could not make any sense of it. I don't have student loans or any medical bills etc.

&amp;#x200B;

My questions are the following:

&amp;#x200B;

1. I have to claim allowances for Federal income tax, state tax, and local tax. I've read that as a single filer, I will automatically have 12,000$ withheld, so claiming 2 allowances for federal income tax is the way to go. Should i also claim 2 allowances for state and local tax? I don't understand.
2. Also there is a question asking if **I claim exemption from withholding for the year 2019 and I certify that I meetBOTH of the following conditions for exemption:**

\-Last year I had a right to a refund of ALL Federal income tax withheld because I had NO tax liability.

\-This year I expect a refund of ALL Federal income tax withheld because I expect to have NO tax liability.

So am I exempt since I had no tax liability as I was under my parents? But technically I will have salary for the last 6 months of 2019. Confused here.

3. What are typical deductions that most people overlook? Im worried I might have some, but unaware. I will be on my own, working quite long hours and would greatly benefit from any dollar saved. If not through deductions, what other methods?

&amp;#x200B;

Just a heads up. I have never had to deal with filing taxes, i dont have a 401k, and just recently opened my own bank account with only one checking account. I have no experience or education with finances and have no savings account because I dont want to make money off interest (religious purposes). If you have any advice regarding these matters, please let me know. Anything is appreciated! Thanks all.",finance

I was in college when I bought the car and didn't have a super great credit score let alone a decent income. Now that I'm graduated I am able to easily make the payments and my credit score is now a 730. Not sure what my current interest rate is though.

$2.8 school loan 5% interest rate - $55 minimum payment

Currently I've been making the minimum payment on the fed loans and paying the minimum + $50-100 extra per month the school loan because it's the highest interest rate.

I have no idea if I should pay this or run it through my insurance.  I have Anthem (through FedEx) which contracts through Texas BCBS.   No one can tell me the contracted rate for an ER doctor visit for an in-network hospital.  Anthem can't tell me, BCBS won't tell me, the ER might tell me, but they also might run it through insurance and if they do that then I can't revert to self-pay, if that's cheaper.   I also have an HRA with about $240 but I can't use this unless it's run through insurance.

Sorry if this is a dumb question but I just wanted to confirm with a second opinion.

The only thing different about the loan options that I can see is the minimum monthly payment ($1000 vs $1250).

Assuming I make the same monthly payment regardless of which I choose ($2000) the amount of interest I will have paid at the end of the loan should be the same, right? 

Wouldn’t the additional principal amount offset the higher interest in the amortization of the 15YR?",finance

The repair plus rental I took, which would have been covered under the service contract had there not been signs of ""abuse"", is looking to be about ~$2,300 which pretty much wipes out most of my abysmal emergency fund (should have had more, I'm an idiot). I'm trying to fight it because I know I don't abuse my car, everything is stock, so I'm not taking it to the track or anything like that. In fact, this is the third time replacing the entire clutch kit, the last time was in March. I suspect something else at work, especially since this problem started up once my engine was replaced because of a recall issue that hit my car (I have all the paper work showing this). Prior to that, my clutch was just dandy, just like in the car I used before this one. Had this been a one time issue, I would sucked it up, blamed myself for being hard on the car, and paid the repair instantly. All that nonsense aside... EVEN if I end up paying for the repairs and rental, I can safely assume the same issue will arise within a few months because like I said, this is the third time. It's to the point where my service advisor knows exactly who I am. It's absurd and I am done with this car, I want it gone. It's been nothing but problems the past year and if I keep it, it would only cause more headaches, and possibly cost me even more in the long run than what I want to do. So here is where the problem lies...

.

What I want thoughts on. Hell, maybe I shouldn't even do this because maybe I'm not thinking clearly...

I'm upside down on the car loan. I owe 9k and would probably get roughly 5-6k in a trade-in (Or am I undervaluing the car? I see them being sold for roughly 9-10k. I have the Recaro and moon roof package in mine, giving me some extra value, but I know wherever I sell it to, wants to flip a profit on it of course). I don't think I could sell privately because it wouldn't sit well with my conscience, knowing this car is going to crap out again soon. I'm considering using a personal loan to pay off the car, sell it, then buy a used reliable beater like Toyota corolla or matrix or something of that nature. I've seen people here say not to go to personal loans because of the high interest rates, but my car loan interest rate is looking to be the same as the personal loans I was pre-approved for, which is 8%. On top of paying off the loan, I'd also be taking my cosigner off the loan and shielding them from anymore of my stupid financial decisions. After selling off my car and then buying a used car, I could either hold onto some of the left over money for emergencies, or pay off a big chunk of the principle on the loan.

The thing is, the current car loan and its interest rate are not currently huge burdens for my financial situation, yes it is wasted money, and they are definitely stupid decisions that I made, and shouldn't have made. I am lucky enough to be in a situation where if my fiesta were actually not falling apart, I would continue making payments to the car, and full coverage insurance without much issue. I have pretty good job security, but am in the market for better paying work. Despite having good job security, I don't make a lot, however I know I can really cut back on my spending to aggressively save up another rainy day fund (if I don't keep any of the leftover money from selling off my car and buying a cheap used car), and then pay the remaining amount I owe. However, paying 1-2k every 2-4 months to replace the clutch kit isn't sensible, and every mechanic I've spoken to about repair quotes agree there is something else wrong with the car. The way I see it, I'm paying for a dumb decision, but the situation isn't something unmanageable. I just want some peace of mind with a car that isn't having a major issue every 2-4 months.

I would appreciate some thoughts and advice. Also sorry if it seems like a ramble, putting this out in writing sort of helps relieve some of the anxiety I've been giving myself over this situation. Because of this, there may be pieces that I left out that don't give a clear picture. I would definitely be more than happy to clear anything up.",finance

personalfinance,"Abnormal Student Loan Situation, How can I work to reduce the damage done to my future finances?","Hello everyone,
I am a current sophomore attending a public university as an out-of-state student. In state was not a viable option for me, and I am currently taking some upper level classes, so I don't think community college is an option. The requirements to attempt to become a resident to receive in-state tuition are pretty harsh,likely to prevent students from moving here and taking advantage of reduced tuition costs (I am located in Arizona). I am double majoring in engineering, so hopefully I will have larger wages (eventually), but my main concern is how to reduce my debt while in school. My school only offers a max of $5000 in loans, $2000 unsubsidized, the rest is subsidized. This has basically forced me to take out loans for my education. I am borrowing through the loan company of Sallie Mae. As of now, I've had to take out a principal amount of $28,348 , with a fixed interest rate of 12.375% (this was for my first year of college), and for summer school, I have had to take out $13,000 , with a fixed rate of about 12.8%. This seems like an awful amount of debt for only one year and a summer, and I fear that I will have exceeded $150k in borrowing by the time I graduate. I was trying to find more information, and it seems as though the average debt amount is around $40k, and I can't tell if these statistics are skewed or if my borrowing is just astronomical. 


I feel that my main questions are:


* -Is this the best method of paying for school?
* -Is it abnormal to graduate with a BSE with over $100k in debt?
* -How should I proceed moving forward?
* -What can I do, in the meantime, to be proactive and prevent so much borrowing?


Thanks!


Edit: I am currently 19 years old, and I am not in a position to try to fight for in-state residency, as FAFSA and the US govt will not let me say I am financially independent (more so to raise the cost of my expected family contribution to college, as we all know FAFSA is an extremely flawed system).  Also, my parents are moving states soon, so i am not sure if I would still be considered a resident of the current state that THEY are in after they move.",finance

personalfinance,SEP vs 401K For Employee,"Hi,

I'm currently working at a small business and looking into retirement options.  My employer is looking at two different options.  The first is being a SEP IRA where he will end up contributing to a SEP IRA account that I open and the other being a standard 401K where I'm doing the contributing (not including a match currently).   I'm going through both options to see which one will be most beneficial to me.

&amp;#x200B;

Basics:

Salary-80k

Bonus-10k for 401k (or 0 for SEP; it'll be built into the employer contribution instead)

Looking to end up with 15k in either retirement account (for comparison purposes)

&amp;#x200B;

[https://ibb.co/DwrdPn5](https://ibb.co/DwrdPn5)

Above is a link to a screenshot of a spreadsheet I created to compare.  Basically, I added up my income and calculated my federal and state tax for both cases.  In the end, it looks like the SEP IRA will be more beneficial to me since I end up with around $64815 instead of $61379 (not factoring any retirement money) mainly due to the fact that I don't have to do any contributions on my end.  In both cases, I still have $15000 in my retirement.

&amp;#x200B;

Besides the obvious tax break in a 401K which is offset since my employer is contributing to my retirement rather than me, is there a difference between a SEP and 401K on the employee side?  I know I'd still owe taxes when I pull the money out in retirement, but I'm not aware of any other differences.

personalfinance,Should I refund and rollover the cash sitting in my old public sector defined-benefit plan? I didn't work there long enough to earn enough credit to get a big pension.,"I'm 30 years old, and recently left 7 years at a job in the public sector (as an employee of the State of Arizona) for a private sector job paying 40% more (with much greater growth potential). I don't ever plan on returning to public employment in Arizona. 

While in public employment, I took advantage of the *huge* benefit of free public university tuition for state employees and got a graduate degree while working (for a total cost of about $1100 in fees over 5 years), and fringe benefits were good. 

BUT, the retirement system was an old-school state pension system, and (I don't think) designed for someone like me who doesn't spend 30+ years working the same job. 

I have an employee balance of $39,000 saved in my pension account, and am thinking of taking a full refund, accepting the penalties, and putting it into an IRA instead. Before you think ""He's giving up the kind of pension we all wish we had!""... hear me out - the pension rules are in fact stacked heavily against someone like me, who is young, with only a short employment record in the pension system.

Here's how the ASRS pension system worked:
*When I started my job 7 years ago, due to my employment classification at the time, I had no choice but to participate in the state's defined-benefit pension system, called ASRS (Arizona State Retirement System). Even though I was promoted to a job that normally would have the option of a 401k style retirement plan, I was locked into the pension system (you're not allowed to leave, while you're employed by the state)
*Out of every paycheck, I had about 11.5% taken out as an employee contribution and deposited into the pension system (it fluctuated by a few fractions of a percent every year). Yeah, it was a lot for someone starting out a new job at $35k per year (although my pay increased over the years)
*The employer ""match"" was also 11.5%
*I earned 6.1 ""service credits"" (i.e. years of service), which factors into the pension calculation.
*The total of my employee contributions, plus interest, is just over **$39,000**, which is the amount that now shows on the statements I receive.

In 2011, I assume as a result of a budget crisis, ASRS made significant downgrades to the terms of the pension system for members joining after 2011 (like me) that don't affect older members and retirees:
*A previous 5 year employer contribution vesting policy was **eliminated entirely**. Yes, eliminated. In other words, I will *never* be able to refund or rollover the accumulated 11.5% employer contribution (which is also $39k, equal to my employee contribution). The only way that ever gets freed up *as a lump sum* is if I died before retirement and my survivor inherited it. Yes, theoretically it goes into a pot that funds the pension system. But it doesn't exist on my account at all (except in the aforementioned case of my death).
*Average monthly compensation metric (used to calculate your pension) was changed from highest 36  to highest 60 months of employment (for me that means it captures 2 more years of lower salary, dragging down the average significantly).
*Statutory interest rate paid on employee contribution balances *upon refund* was reduced to 4% until June 2013, and then reduced again to 2% for everything contributed past July 2013. This means that they will essentially claw back a lot of the interest earned on your contributions, penalizing you for taking money out. In other words, almost all the money I contributed to ASRS, if I refund fully, will be refunded based on a calculation *as if* I had been earning a measly 2% interest. 

So here are my options, firmly knowing I will never return to work for the state of AZ or any other public employer in AZ:

1. Leave the funds on account with ASRS until early (50), or full retirement age (65).
Taking into account all of the above, especially the really poor 2% interest rate, the ASRS website calculator and my statements show me these exact estimates for a straight life annuity payment:
*Upon retirement at age 50: **Monthly benefit of $195 per month for the rest of my life**
*Upon retirement at age 65: **Monthly benefit of $556 per month for the rest of my life.**

As far as I can tell, there are no cost of living increases or adjustments for inflation. Those monthly benefit estimates are in real dollars and the numbers wouldn't change over time.


2. Take a refund of my employee contributions, forfeit all rights to any future retirement, and roll the funds over to an IRA, to invest in a target-date retirement fund (as I'm currently doing with my new job's 401k, which I'm of course maxing out). *The total gross refund I'd get would be $35,329.*

Let's assume I'm extremely healthy and live to age 95:

Option 1 retiring at 50: Between age 50 and 95, I receive 540 checks of $195.
Total benefit earned by age 95: $105,300

Option 1 retiring at 65: Between age 65 and 95, I receive 360 checks of $556.
Total benefit earned by age 95: $200,160

Option 2, taking $35,329 right now, investing it in an IRA with a target date retirement fund, assuming a very conservative 5% annual return, and not touching it or adding to it (lets assume it's in a separate account) until I retire at age 67, then living another 28 years to age 95:
Account value upon retirement 37 years from now (using a retirement interest calculator): $214,673
Additional earnings if I spend down to 0 at age 95: $206,940
Total benefit earned by age 95: $421,000 (assuming a 3% inflation requiring greater withdrawls each year).

**Basically: it seems crazy to me to leave the money with ASRS and take a piddly pension check, when I could refund the cash, invest it, and earn a much better return through my retirement**

I may not be completely accurate on the calculators and of course I can't predict how the markets or inflation will perform the next 65 years of my life, but it sure seems like anything beats leaving money in an account at 2% interest, that won't even break even until I'm quite old.

**TLDR: I want to refund $35k of employee contributions (there are no accessible employer contributions) from my highly restrictive state pension system, and forfeit a tiny monthly lifetime check, to instead invest it in an IRA for retirement. Am I totally missing something? Am I crazy? Or am I crazy for waiting even one more day to do this?**",finance

personalfinance,Roth IRA Target Date Fund for a 19 year old,"I’m pretty knew with this retirement investing stuff so I just want to make sure I’m not making any mistakes. I’m in college debt free (planning to graduate debt free as well) and make 30k working part time. College is being paid with scholarships and federal grants so that’s a plus. If everything goes well, Im planning to be able to max out my Roth at 6k since I don’t really have any major expenses to deal with at the moment.

Is the target date fund my best bet if I want to let it sit and make me money with time? I’m planning on choosing Vanguard with the TR 2060. Is this a good decision or will another route such as VTSAX give me more?",finance

personalfinance,Unexpected Gift of Life Insurance Policy for Turning 18,"Throwaway because I don't want friends knowing about this.

Yesterday was my 18th birthday, and for it I got a very unexpected gift from my dad: ownership of my life insurance policy. I didn't even know I had one, but I guess I did, and starting in June it will be mine.

I don't really know what to do with it. Both of my parents recommend surrendering the policy for its net cash value of ~$14k (more money than I've ever seen, thanks Dad), and I agree because I don't want to pay premiums for a plan when I don't have any dependents. But, it isn't exactly a small plan, the net death benefit is like ~$160k, up from the $100k initial benefit when the plan was created in 2007. I wouldn't even say I'm worth that much.

I don't even know how this plan could increase, did that just happen naturally or because my parents increased it? **If it is natural, is it worth it to just keep the plan to have a strong life insurance when I grow older and have dependents?**

I don't really know how life insurance works so excuse my stupidity.

Then, if it doesn't increase naturally, I think the logical thing to do is take the short-term $14k. My parents disagree on what to do with this money. My dad wants me to just keep it as long-term spending money, a buffer in a checking account so that I can be comfortable for the next four years in college while also learning about managing spending and finance. Not enough to never check my account, but enough to not seriously worry that I won't be able to afford a shirt or something.

My mom is thinking more longer term: open an IRA ASAP, and put in my $6k max. Start early on retirement. I'm liking that idea, but I don't know if it's the best option for long-term. Should I be more brazen and invest in something more risky? Or just get a savings account (I only have a checking right now, BofA really doesn't offer good interest rates in savings) and put it in there?

I guess that explains the situation. I know I am so very lucky to even have this problem, and I've tried to learn everything I can to manage myself, but this amount is more than I know but less than the examples under ""Windfalls $$$"" on here.


**What should I do? All of this is very new to me so any explanations would be greatly appreciated.**

----
tl;dr:

My father gifted me my life insurance plan for my 18th. Do I:

1. Keep the plan (~$163k in net death benefit)
2. Surrender the plan (~$14k):
    1. Put the money in checking and have a better college life
    2. Open a savings account
    3. Put it in an IRA, start that early
    4. Invest with more risk

worldpolitics,Russia remains an energetic leader,"Russia, which ranks first in the world in the construction of nuclear power plants abroad, is implementing more than 30 projects in 12 countries, for example, ""Kudankulam"" in India, ""Bushehr"" in Iran, ""Akkuyu"" in Turkey, ""Hanhikivi"" nuclear power plants in Finland and ""Ed Dhaba"" in Egypt, which are scheduled to be commissioned for 2024-2026, as well as ""Tianwan"" and ""Xuidapu"" nuclear power plants in China, etc.

But the United States and some Western countries, due to the lack of competitiveness of their own energy companies, are trying in every possible way to prevent Russia from achieving its success. Thus, the United States has long begun to pursue a policy of sanctions pressure against the Russian Federation and the countries contributing to it. However, as practice has shown, this does not prevent the leadership of the President of the Russian Federation V. Putin from carrying out its activities in any field, because as far back as 2016, Russia, despite of economic restrictions, was able to rise to 45th place from the previous 44th, which cannot make its American partners not to be nervous.

Also, at the end of March 2019, it became known that the administration of the US President D. Trump is preparing a series of measures to improve the position of American companies in the competition for the construction of nuclear power plants of the new generation around the world - a struggle in which they themselves are losing today, trying discourage foreign partners from cooperating with Moscow, which in turn is a direct competitor to the United States. At the same time, even taking into account the diplomatic weight of the State Department, it will not be easy to get contracts in the field of energy, as the Americans have difficulties even with building reactors at their own home.

But in addition to economic sanctions, the United States unreasonably makes the ridiculous arguments that Russian nuclear power plants allegedly have an adverse impact on the environment. However, all technologies at the sites are reliable. Thus, for example, the most popular Russian VVER-1200 reactor of Generation 3+ provides for the influence of the human factor and even in the case of beyond design basis accidents prevents radiation from escaping into the environment, protection against earthquakes, tsunamis, hurricanes, aircraft crashes. Moreover, according to the Russian Nuclear Society, the reactor meets all the ""post-Fukushima"" safety requirements, the most stringent recommendations of the IAEA and the Club of European Operating Organizations.

Also, since 2018, Russia has been developing tolerant nuclear fuel, which is believed to help to prevent accidents at nuclear power plants like Fukushima. And according to experts, it is quite possible that in a few years new fuel will become an obligatory component of contracts for the supply of fuel for nuclear power plants.

It should be noted that by 2020 in Russia at the ""Brest-300"" NPP near the city of Tomsk they plan to launch the production of nuclear fuel, which can not only produce electricity, but also ""burn through"" spent nuclear fuel and prepare new fuel for themselves. Experts note the high level of security of this project, which allows building such reactors almost directly in the cities - they do not require any exclusion zone, and in case of any failure and the system leaves the specified parameters, the whole process immediately fades without radiation emissions or hazardous substances. According to general director of the Siberian Chemical Combine, S. Tochilin, ""the project will show everyone that nuclear power plants can be a profitable, clean, environmentally friendly business. And this will be a new milestone in the development of the entire global energy industry"".

Experts note that Russia remains and will remain a leader in the energy sector, despite regular unreasonable protests and restrictions from the United States and Western countries, which, in turn, only assist Russia in accelerating the process of import substitution in the country. Thus, according to the forecast of the British BP, in 20 years Russia will meet five percent of the global demand for primary energy resources and produce up to 14% of oil and gas.",energy
personalfinance,My father is thinking of taking out his retirement fund to pay off the house?,"Principle Balance - $237,000
Interest Rate 4.5%

Bitcoin,Cryptopia exchange questions?,"Hi,

Isn't cryptopia based in Australia or New Zealand where the exchange must follow strict rules and regulations from the government and isn't there should be a compensation scheme for customers if the exchange gets hacked?

Which coins got hacked in the 1st hack and 2nd hack?

Isn't this the 2nd time the exchange got hacked within a year? I remember the exchange was compensating stolen bitcoins in new zealand dollars in the 1st hack.

I remember bitfinex and mt.gox exchanges got hacked but they were in countries where that was little or no regulations so surely cryptopia cant easily just run off with our coins without the feds chasing them down right? If so surely there will be arrests made correct? I hear mt.gox is compensating customers now after all these years from 2013 so how long do you think cryptopia will take or is it a scam where we will never see our coins again?

If a customer lives outside new zealand or australia then how will a customer file a lawsuit against cryptopia if the exchange keeps neglecting the customer?

What percentage ratio did cryptopia kept the coins in cold storage in compared to hot storage? I understand hackers can steal from hot storage meaning cold coins are still there.

Whos is the ceo of cryptopia and how do we make contact otherwise is there like a dedicated contact email for customers in regards to the hack?

How many customers did cryptopia had in total?

Finally is there a chance to see the exchange going back online soon to allow customers to withdraw their coins that were not hacked?",cryptocurrency

He has 10 remaining relatives that are named as his beneficiaries.

My parents say that ""because of the way the will was written,"" the disbursement goes to his small business account, and then is taxed at a really high rate because his business was in a high tax bracket (they said 37% for federal and 10% for state).

Is this right? I'm confused, as I feel like the disbursement is not the same as income for the business. Following that logic, out of \~$10,000 that each of us inherits, we would only receive $5,300 after taxes?

Why isn't the $10,000 given to the beneficiaries and then taxed at our own individual tax rates (which are much lower)?

Does anyone know the answer to this, or know who I can ask for an answer?

So I need help, or rather advice, on creating a financial plan moving forward.

My wife and I are expecting our first child in September. She has zero debt whatsoever besides a car payment. I, on the other hand, have about about $35k-$45k in credit card debt due to irresponsibility when I was younger that snowballed. We're in a good position in terms of how much we make a year (approximately $110k) but my credit score is dog shit. We're talking 580. My wife's is good at around 700 but she only makes about $27k-$32k a year. Mine is so low because my student loans came out of forbearance earlier than I anticipated and went 90 days delinquent before I had any clue I was late because I never checked my inbox from Fedloan. Our rent for a 2 bedroom apartment is approximately 1800/month. I've done some budgeting but need advice and tips for moving forward. We want to buy a house which requires us saving money but at the end of the day of the \~4500 I bring home a month, $1000 goes to revolving debt alone. How can I move forward with paying off debt and saving money when budgeting is looking tight given I'm affording a lot towards the cost the kid will incur?",finance

Are things like a home equity loan or reverse mortgage better options in this case?  Would doing the cash-out refi and THEN a reverse mortgage on that for monthly income be advisable?

I get a 2TB SSD drive that I transfer/download all the js packages, software, applications, and GUI that I like to use as well as host all my local test sites that rely on those packages. I can then connect it to my work computer so, technically, I'm not downloading anything. Then I can replace my aging Macbook with a nice little Mac Mini that I can also plug in this SSD into. Periodically I would copy the entire hard drive onto another backup just so everything isn't stored in one central location.

personalfinance,Liquidate wife's IRA to pay off her student loans?,"Been thinking about this for a while and would love to get PF's feedback. My wife stopped working when our daughter was born, so we rolled her 403(b) into an IRA with about $18K in it. She has about that much in loans at a 6.8% interest rate, and over the years, I actually forgot she even had an IRA. Given our current situation, we can't really afford to put money into it each month (we knew this would happen with my wife staying home). I max out my 401K, but we're stuck with this pesky $500 a month payment to her loans which will take another few years to pay off.

Since I forgot about the IRA, is it worth it to just take the penalty and get the debt off our books? Having the $18K in the IRA doesn't make a big difference in our lives and we pay about $125 in interest per month for these loans. Thanks in advance for any advice or feedback!",finance
personalfinance,Graduate student and car loans,"I’m sorry if this is similar to other posts, I have read a few but would like some advice on my situation.

I am in my final year of physical therapy school- because of this I have six figures in federal loans between undergrad and graduate school. I will graduate next May and will most likely be employed by next June/July depending on the processing of my licensure exam.

I currently have a 2002 Pontiac Grand Prix with 143k miles on it which has been having issues. It has an upper/lower intake manifold leak which is putting oil into my coolant. The estimate to repair is $1800. It also is need of some other repairs to pass emissions next year which are not included in that cost.

I’m working on a PRN basis doing home care and position assisting in a clinic. I make roughly $300 extra a month.This last few weeks I have been a me to work 40 hours a weeks and will have a total of $1500 saved. I am also able to take out additionally loan money each quarter for school related expenses. I also have a decent credit score around 700.

In my situation, should I fix the car that I have now or start looking to finance a new/used care using my saved money for a down payment and a small amount of loan money for monthly payments just for the next year? I need transportation to go to class as well as my last few clinical rotations. I have my parents to co-sign if necessary, but would like to avoid that as they just took out a loan for a new car and I don’t want to hurt their credit.

I was hoping to replace the car within the next few years because I will be making significantly more after graduation; however, it seems to have made other plans.

Sorry for the long post. I appreciate any advice!",finance
personalfinance,Should We refinance?,"We bought our house 4 years ago with a super small interest rate 3.75%, but it is an FHA that will always have PMI.  Our home value has risen substantially...we bought at $224,000 and it’s roughly worth between $280,000-290,000 today.

Right now we owe about $204,000.  

We are looking at refinancing to a 30 year conventional loan around 4.5% to loose the PMI and lower our monthly payment-our taxes went up $200/month at the beginning of the year so it would be nice to get back down to our old monthly payment.  

We do plan on eventually selling, probably within the next 2-3 years because our family has outgrown this house, but we are trying to be wise, pay off all our debt and save a big down payment for the next house.

personalfinance,"Recently graduated, trying to figure out how to prioritize debt and miscellaneous financial entities related to moving for the first time","Hey guys, 

I am posting here, because I just wanted some verification on some things. I consulted the flow chart, but am a bit confused on some details. I am starting a new job (fresh out of college) and am moving to a new state. I graduated this past spring (May 2019). 

I have roughly 6k saved, and my first plan is to save up to roughly 10k for an emergency fund. 

Next, I will prioritize my company’s 401k match, which is up to 6% on 50% of my income. Just to make sure my math is correct on this, this value should be base salary * .06 *.5 in order to receive max match contribution, correct?

So, if my base salary is 70,000, then 70000*.06*.5 = $2100 is the 401k max match contribution?

I currently have roughly $25k in student loans, from what I understand, I should focus on those with the highest interest rates first. 

However, I am somewhat confused here. My student loans range in interest rates from 3.8 percent to 5 percent. All of my remaining loans are federal loans. 

First, I am confused as to why some of my loans have already accrued interest. I have 6 loans that have accrued interest. I was under the impression that the interest would not start to kick-in til around 6 months after graduation? Only some of my loans have accrued interest, but other have not. 

Secondly, since there is not much variance in the interest rates of my loans should I still focus on the highest interest rate, or should I focus on highest principal? For example, one of the loans that I have currently that has already accrued interest is at 3.8 percent, but has a $2500 balance, while another loan I have is at 4.66 percent and has a principal of $1750 (total value including interest being around $2000). 


Is there anything I should inquire about or look into beyond this with my employer or finances in general? If my math is correct, it will take a year to pay off my loans or so, but I won’t be able to contribute much if anything to retirement accounts (besides the 401k match as described above). 

Finally, is there any general recommendation or guidelines as to how to pick a bank? 

Any help you guys can provide is extremely appreciated!

personalfinance,Student getting my first credit card- couple basic questions,"I’m getting my first credit card so I can build a credit score and eventually take out student loans when I need them. I know the basics about credit cards (pay it off every month, don’t buy more than you can’t afford). I know I need a card with a low interest rate and a low limit (I don’t plan on using it often).
So I ask, is it a good idea to open an account with a  bank that also offers student loans, like Wells Fargo? I’d assume so, but does it make a huge difference what bank I have if I want to eventually take out loans? 
Also, are benefits like cash back and rewards on restaurants and shit really necessary? I feel like benefits just make the whole thing more complicated. I don’t need them... I have money already. Just looking to build my credit score.
Any recommendations for a super basic card that won’t scam me?

personalfinance,Best way to handle large amount of credit card debt,"Background: 
I am in my mid-30s and have only lived in extremely expensive cities on a nonprofit worker's salary. I have substantial retirement savings and a small emergency fund. Over the past decade I have developed a large chunk of credit card debt - roughly $40K. I have no other debt whatsoever. 

The origins of this debt are complicated, but I generally spend within my means, and I have hardly used a credit card in a year. But the debt is what it is, and I want to figure out a better way to deal with it.

It's spread across three cards, each with a different rate. For a while I was paying about $1,200 per month across the three cards (yes, the total debt used to be even bigger) but I got a GREAT new job that alas involved a $30K pay cut. I am now down to making about $800 in payments per month. I feel relatively comfortable, but this isn't great.  

I always pay more than the minimums, and as I said, I am not adding new charges. Nonetheless, it will be years and years before the debt is gone, the interest keeps piling up, and I am increasingly irritated by its presence in a way I wasn't when I was taking home a bigger paycheck.   

Question: 
Is a debt consolidation-type loan a bad idea? Would it be worth seriously investigating this? I am not worried that I will run up new charges on the cards. I am just tired of making different sized payments on different cards with different interest rates and hardly seeing the balances change, and it *feels* like if I had it all in one big lump with one interest rate, it would be more manageable and I could just slap $800+ on it every month. Am I fooling myself?

If a loan seems like a bad idea, do you have suggestions about other ways to streamline/consolidate/etc this large amount of credit card debt? Any advice is welcome!",finance

financialindependence,"Will I really have $3,400,000 - $7,000,000 by the time I'm 55?","Hello everybody, 

&amp;#x200B;

I've been investing for a little bit now, I'm 25 and have investable assets worth $225,000, split pretty evenly between my 401k and taxable accounts. I've done a lot of spreadsheeting and projecting and I just need somebody to double check me because the results are rather unbelievable.

&amp;#x200B;

I was playing with [https://www.investor.gov/additional-resources/free-financial-planning-tools/compound-interest-calculator](https://www.investor.gov/additional-resources/free-financial-planning-tools/compound-interest-calculator) since it has a nice interface and with my current numbers plugged into their calculator: 

|initial investment|$225,000|
|:-|:-|
|Monthly Contribution|$5,000|
|Length of Time in Years|30|
|Interest Rate|5%|
|Interest Rate Variance Range|2%|
|Compound Frequency|Annually|

&amp;#x200B;

It says that by each age I will have:

|Age|Min (3% growth)|Mid (5% growth)|Max (7% growth)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|30 (5 years)|$579,384.82|$618,701.23|$660,618.48|
|35 (10 years)|$990,213.94|$1,121,174.84|$1,271,595.93|
|40 (15 years) |$1,466,477.50|$1,762,472.66|$2,128,523.42|
|45 (20 years)|$2,018,597.50|$2,580,949.23|$3,330,408.54|
|50 (25 years)|$2,658,655.89|$3,625,555.79|$5,016,114.61|
|55 (30 years)|$3,400,659.00|$4,958,767.88|$7,380,404.56|

&amp;#x200B;

So basically with the number that everybody throws around as the ""average annual yield of the s&amp;p500 after inflation"" of 7% I'll have 7.3MM invested between my taxable accounts and 401k.   


This seems like a completely mind boggling number right now, it basically means that if I keep my current lifestyle, then I'll be rather rich come ""early"" retirement age (I enjoy my job and will probably stay for a long time but not till i'm 62)

personalfinance,Question About Co-signing a Car Loan.,"Before I get brigades by people telling me what an awful idea co-signing a car loan is, please just read the whole post before and give constructive answers if possible before posting your personal opinion. 

My Fiancé and I are currently in the market for a car for her. Currently under my name I have a car that is about 50% payed off, which was co-signed by my father. The decision for him to co-sign was NOT made because I could not afford the payments, but because we were both aware that I was fully financially capable of paying for it, and his co-signing allowed me to get a lower interest rate and therefore lower total price for the car.

My question is this, due to mistakes made with her ex-husband my Fiancé does not have the best credit, so in order to get her a car I am most likely going to have to co-sign for it. Am I able to have my name on multiple car loans at a time? My credit is on the higher end (680+) and I do not have any large debts currently owed if that makes a difference.

Or is this not possible? If need be I can refinance my current car loan to remove my father as a co-signer if this is inhibiting co-signing for someone else. And yes, I realize how this situation could turn horrible if my Fiancé and I were to break up, but we have been together for 5+ years and I have no fears of that happening. Still I do fully recognize the risk associated with co-signing alone if anyone is worried about that!

Thanks for any and all input! Just to clarify this will not be happening for several weeks most likely so I have plenty of time to weigh all options, we also have several thousand dollars as well as a car to trade in, and are in the market for a nice used car, nothing flashy.

If it'll affect my credit, I'll just pay half of the one. I'm assuming it'd have a similar impact on interest, but then I'd have both loans still open to help the age of my overall credit. Otherwise, I'll take the small win of paying one off if it won't affect my score.

personalfinance,Is private student loan debt worth it? (PLS HELP),"Hello, I am a film student considering transferring from my current school the University of New Orleans to Loyola University New Orleans where the tuition is much much higher. Right now, I have absolutely no student debts because my tuition is low enough to be paid off monthly. However, I feel stagnant at my current school and don't see much room to grow in the ways I see myself needing to grow to succeed in the film industry. Loyola I feels provides a better curriculum and environment to challenge me and allow me to grow in ways I need to grow. But as of right now, after a federal subsidized loan of $4,500, and an unsubsidized loan of $2,000, I am still $9,000 short of being able to afford the tuition. The last available option I see is a private student loan (which I am still pretty unfamiliar with). I am pretty terrified to get involved with a private loans because I've been told to avoid them at ALL costs. Also, I'm scared of being in debt for the rest of my life when I don't necessarily NEED to. On the flip side, I worry that I may never be fully prepared for my career path (or even grow as a person) if I were to stay at my current university where I pay no loans. 

My parents would potentially be able to pay $3,000 at most to Loyola, so that would bring me down to $6,000 a year in private loans which is more manageable but I have to couple that with $6,500 of federal loans and multiple everything times two considering I have two years left of college. ( Can't forget about the interest also).

personalfinance,Student Loan Nightmare: Wage Garnish plus required monthly payments,"I could use a lot of guidance.. took me a while to get on my feet all while being a main care taker to my mom.  Long story short, I've quickly learned to get a better grasp on my finances and debt.  I have a spreadsheet, I'm constantly managing to make sure my debt isn't managing me.. but these student loans are just straight up crippling.

Easy notes:
- Student loans are now in garnishments, pulling ~$350-400 out of EACH paycheck (biweekly).  Garnishments will continue until 5 'Required Payments' are fulfilled
- 'Required Payment'= In addition to the garnishment, I filled out paperwork (noting salary and mothers illness) and applied for the Loan Rehabilitation Program, which is requiring a minimum of $250 per month (separate from/ in addition to garnishment).  Cannot make more than 1 'Required Payment' per month.
- Interest on the loan is building, however, the collections company disclosed they are not allowed to share the interest rate.  The rate is noticeably high and compounding, and feels like I'm not paying anything off at all.
- Loan total was originally $20k, collections agency added fees (and interest) now looking at $28k
- I'm paying in all ~$1000 per month and that's living on bare minimum of small cheap diet, not going out, nothing to spend outside of bills.


Help. I'm beyond broke and sad.  Any tips of ways to find wiggle room from these folks?  This is straight up no mercy.. and I feel like I'm stuck here forever

Ideally I'd like to find some sort of way into at least minimizing the interest rate or fees, so I can get traction on this thing.",finance

personalfinance,Are there places to find reviews or opinions on local housing programs?,"We're getting married soon and looking at property now. I talked to a loan officer last night about getting preapproved and from pretty early on in the process decided to pursue looking at an Ohio Grants for Grads program. My main concern was hearing that the interest rate we could be looking at with the program would be 5.2%, much higher than the 4.2-4.5% I've been hearing in the area. We briefly discussed options without the program, but only to the extent that I wouldn't have any issues getting a loan without the program provided I'm able to adjust how much I'll need for the house, but he did not go into details about this.  


Now I know there's tons of law on the FHA and my own state has plenty of it's own rules and additions. I don't have time to necessarily read and understand the minutia of all of the details that may or may not apply to my situation. I'd like to trust other opinions on the program and whether I'm shooting myself in the foot with it if I can manage to wait a bit longer to have more money saved. However all of the searching I can do only seems to turn up Ohio pages with official program rhetoric, and then some other ad-bait sites that just have random list articles for housing programs available in the state.  


Are there ways to find good advice for local programs like this and whether or not they're good for someone's situation? I know a loan officer should be the best resource, but when I'm approaching them as a customer that is not an expert, I know they have their own motivations in this transaction and I might not end up with the ""best"" loan for me. I also know that ""best"" is a hard question to answer, and is subjective to my situation. The program might be the best for me if it actually makes the mortgage accessible, but it might not be the best if I can afford other options or make them work.",finance

personalfinance,SIMPLE IRA vs savings vs loans vs anything else,"I'm in my mid 30s, cohabitating with no kids and totally separate finances, making just over 100k. I also have just over 100k in federal student loans, which I'm repaying on PAYE.

Been maxing out my IRA since I started working (around 30) and my HSA for the last 2 or 3 years. I didn't start worrying about saving until I finished school, so I sometimes feel like I need to catch up to some ideal. 

I have a solid 6 month emergency fund in cash and another 6 months in a brokerage account.

I don't have any short-term plans to buy a home.

New employer is offering a SIMPLE IRA, and I think I'd like to max out ($13k for 2019, does not affect individual IRA contribution eligibility), meaning contributing $1000 per paycheck. 

I figure this would reduce my paycheck my about 750 as this would be a pretax contribution. I could do this without changing my spending as I'm currently sending about that amount into my brokerage account out of every check. Then at the new year, I could cut the deduction in half, continue maxing, and resume growing my non-retirement assets. 

I believe this plan would also cut my PAYE payments, which sounds like a good thing, but over the last year I've started to get antsy about having student loans on my back for another 15-20 years. Up until I got offered this SIMPLE, I had been lightly considering making extra payments on the loans. 

Can I get some thoughts or advice on this plan?",finance
personalfinance,"SEP combined with IRA, what else should I do?","I work for a small business that provides an SEP for a retirement plan, where they contribute 10% of my base salary. I’m not able to contribute more to that account because it’s an SEP, so I also have an IRA that I maxed out the tax deferred contribution in 2018.

I’m 22 years old, debt free, have $10k in an emergency fund and an additional $8k in cash savings. After I’ve budgeted for the month I still have a chunk of money that goes to savings and I feel it could be be put to better use than a 2% interest rate.

My thought is that I should continue maxing out my deferrable contribution to the IRA every year, this would correspond to putting about 10% of my base salary in the IRA. 

If I wanted to contribute more to retirement would it be best to do so in a Roth IRA, or am I contributing enough already? Should I use the extra savings to open a cash brokerage account to invest in index funds? I’d like to save up money for down payment on a home so I can start building equity instead of just throwing rent money out the window every month.

personalfinance,How to calculate time to payoff student loans with different interest rates and pay ahead on the highest interest ones?,"Hi all. I have eight student loans remaining from undergrad and gradschool totaling about $63,000. I've been paying them off for about 5 years now. 

My strategy for paying off my student loans has been to set my monthly payments to the minimum 25 year plan, and then pay over by a certain amount towards the highest-interest loans (6.55% in this case), increasing the amount I pay over as my earnings have increased. 

I wanted to be able to calculate exactly how long it will take me to finish paying off my loans with this strategy. The problem is I can't find a calculator anywhere that fits my criteria. 

* Ability to input multiple loans with different interest rates.
* Having the option to add a pay-over amount (but only towards one of the loans, not as a lump sum).
* Ability to snowball your payments so you keep paying the same amount even as you pay off each individual loan.

Honestly all I need is a decent equation I can input into excel. If I go with the lump sum calculator available on Lending Tree it says I save about 8 years, taking me 17 instead of 25, but I figure since I'm focusing that money towards the highest interest rate loan this number would be even faster in reality.

Mortgage Insurance: $85 (I'm assuming this is out of their control.  Is that accurate to assume?)

I've compared detailed closing costs between the two and seems to be a near wash.  Guild charges maybe $200 more for processing/underwriting, however it's a nominal amount to me.  

I also assume prepaid costs are out of either lender's control.  Whatever it is, it is.  Accurate to assume?

I'm slightly more comfortable talking and working with Evergreen.  So if it were even, I'd go with them.  However, if it's at a cost of $400+ per year, I would rethink that.

personalfinance,Life insurance interest from 1099-INT included as income on federal taxes?,"Every year I get a 1099-INT form from a life insurance policy.  I've always included it as income with my job salary since that's what I thought you were supposed to do.  The interest on the life insurance policy is just added in the policy.  I never see it.

I just asked my insurance company and they said they don't see anything about the interest being taxable income.  That's someone over the phone though, so I take that with a grain of salt.  I also was googling before and found that even if you don't pay taxes on 1099-INT interest, you are still required to report it on federal tax forms somewhere.


How do I know for sure if I'm supposed to include the 1099-INT interest as income?

personalfinance,(US) Federal Student Loans: Income Based Repayment plans or Pay off aggressively?,"I got an on call job in my field and have no set of hours. In the hopes it turns into full time I could make a minimum of 65-70k a year. I currently have just shy of $100k in loan debt. 

My payments are coming up soon and I won’t have enough income to pay the standard monthly of ~$1000. So I will call Navient to put me on either the PAYE, REPAYE, or IBR payment plan in the meantime to decrease the payments.

But for long term, with IBR, PAYE, or REPAYE any remaining loan balance is forgiven after 20-25 years. When I get the full time job and start making decent money should I begin paying off the loan debts aggressively with as much as I can, or should I just stick with the income based plans and wait it out for 25 years.

I feel like paying it off aggressively (snowball method) is the better choice, to just get the debt off my shoulders and be done with it, but that means at any point if I decide to switch to an Income based plan (for lower monthly payments), all that extra money I put into the loans prior through the aggressive snowball method would be wasted. (Aside from the inevitable tax bomb they hit you with). And if I do choose to pay aggressively, I’ll have much less monthly income for living expenses since more of it is being allocated to loans.

If I choose the longer IBR/PAYE/REPAYE payment plans with lower monthly payments, other than the fact that I know I will have huge debt looming over me for the next 25 years, I am wondering if things like my credit and credit score would be affected mostly due to the high DTI.",finance

personalfinance,Trying to make a good financial choice on a used car,"I need some car buying advice, please. I currently don't own a car because I've been living abroad the past few years. I'm not sure if I'm staying in the states. I'm agonizing over this decision. I have it narrowed down to the choice of car I want.

I put down a 2500 down payment (on a credit card) at a used car dealership for a 2010 Acura RDX with 58k miles on it. But the car dealer has been acting very manipulative and shady. Without going too far into detail, he's made a bunch of rude comments/stuff you should never say to a customer/ has been lying and manipulative and trying to pressure me. I feel they are asking too much for the car. I tried to negotiate down and he kept saying stuff like ""My manager is getting angry that you're still trying to negotiate after putting down a down payment..."" he then tried to tell me I wouldn't be able to get my down payment back because of a $1500 ""restocking fee."" I told him I never signed anything agreeing to that and I would take him to court. He  back pedaled, telling me I could get my refund. He keeps saying and doing weird stuff that is making me uncomfortable. 

The CarFax report lists 5 previous owners. When I questioned him on this, he said ""Well if you had read it carefully you'd see the last 3 were dealerships."" But the Carfax report just lists them as ""personal"" and nothing more. I am not someone who knows a lot about cars nor do I claim to, but why would this list the dealerships as owners when plenty of other used cars for sales at dealerships are not listed as being owned by the dealership? 

They were asking above what KBB suggests. I talked them down a little, but still feel it's a bit too much. The sell price would be 15,200.

My other option is to buy the same model used but it's a 2013 and being sold by a private party. It's also more expensive. (19,750 i what they are asking). It's had 2 owners. 

I can pay for either one in cash, however I would rather not do that. I'd rather keep the money in my savings account. I qualified for a 3.99% loan through Lightstream (my credit score is 820) for the used car from a dealer... If I go private party, the interest rate would be 4.99%.

I don't want to spend too much on a car because I don't know how long I will stay in the states and if I decide to move back abroad, I feel like it might be a bad choice to spend a lot on a car. On the other hand, is buying a 2010 Acura a good choice? I'm worried that if I go to sell it, I might have issues finding a buyer? 

Also, the used car dealership gave me a copy of the inspection report that was done by a Honda dealer. Should I still take it a mechanic of my choice?  Do either one of these options stand out as being the better choice given my situation? 
I would really appreciate some input here.",finance
personalfinance,Avoiding tax underpayment when most of your income is in RSU?,"After a long delay, my tax return was finally prepared by the company my employer outsources it to (part of my relocation package), and I was greeted with a note that I owe around $18,000 of federal taxes to the IRS because my withholdings during the year were too low. This was much to my surprise since for 2017 my federal taxes were on point, and I didn't have to pay anything back.

My total gross income for 2018 was around $330,000, and around $180,000 of that was RSU vests. My W-4 has me claiming 1 allowance (which was the same in 2017), and my RSU vests are set to sell to cover tax. From what I can see, the federal tax rate they use for RSUs is 22% and I don't see any options for changing that.

In 2017 my total gross income was $190,000 and the federal taxes were withheld correctly. But I also had less RSUs vest (base salary changed just a little over $3,000 from 2017 to 2018).

FACT 2: Bitcoin's Sha 256 is a subset of cryptographic hash functions designed by the United States National Security Agency (NSA).

SHA-2 (Secure Hash Algorithm 2) is a set of cryptographic hash functions designed by the United States National Security Agency (NSA). The SHA-2 family consists of six hash functions with digests (hash values) that are 224, 256, 384 or 512 bits: SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512, SHA-512/224, SHA-512/256.

BOOM! Yes people, NSA actually came up with the backbone of Bitcoin. It is right under the spotlight. Who else, besides from NSA, could have taken NSA tech and use it to create Bitcoin?  


FACT 3: If the Fed/NSA/US Government really wanted to destroy Bitcoin, they could have and would have done a 51% attack already, it is dirt cheap. 

But no, instead they sent a hairless patsy like Brad Sherman to whine about it in public. Do you really think Sherman is the US government's best shot against Bitcoin?

To launch  a 51% attack on Bitcoin, it only takes $8.4 billion USD in hardware, and a day run rate of $5 million USD to do so.

To put things into perspective, the Fed just sold $27 billion USD worth of US Treasuries on 8th of May. Apple's market value is $859 billion USD. Yes NSA/Fed/US Government could easily break Bitcoin if they wanted to.

&amp;#x200B;

This email reports that my insurance is higher than it needs because, ""-Proportion of revolving balances to revolving credit limits is too high, or there are no revolving credit accounts (-)."" This doesn't make any sense because I only have 1 credit card in my name and I have a 0 balance on it and have never missed a payment. I have never had any other loans. I called TransUnion and their friendly customer service in India had no idea what this statement meant. I called Geico and asked them about it and they said I should dispute it with TransUnion. I signed up on the TransUnion website and reviewed my full credit history and lo and behold there are no negative remarks. The representative at Geico told me if she was to rerun the credit check it would just pull the same results if TransUnion doesn't do anything on their end.

personalfinance,I didn't file form 8962 when I submitted my taxes in January and I still don't have my federal return,"Hello pf. I filed my taxes back in January. Self prepared on TurboTax. I was ignorant to the fact that I would be getting a 1095-A from [Healthcare.gov](https://Healthcare.gov). This was my first time using this for coverage for my family and I only used it because I was layed off for an extended period of time. Long story short, I e-filed on TT and was expecting a return of $6142. Fed was accepted on Jan 28th. The end of February rolls around and I'm thinking its strange that my return still wasn't direct deposited only to get a letter from the IRS stating their records show I recieved a 1095-A and didn't report it. It stated that I was supposed to submit a form 8962 in the mail to them with the info from my 1095-A, but if they didn't receive anything that they would proccess my return with the info they had on record and I would get my return in 6 to 8 weeks. So I did nothing.... (regretfully so I admit now).

&amp;#x200B;

I had healthcare coverage from the marketplace for about 6 months. I later got a job and started using their insurance. Turns out I made too much in those 6 months for my family to stay qualified for the premium tax credit and it now has to be completely repayed. 1095-A Box 33C states $4653. My original refund was for $6142. So by that math I am still owed $1489. I haven't received any additional letters/emails/calls pertaining to my refund. What should I do?",finance

personalfinance,Where to put my upcoming bonuses while in mountains of debt?,"I am getting a $2000 bonus next week, then another bonus in late July that will be $4500-6000 (performance based so unsure how much but something around there). I want to allocate them in the best way possible but I basically always live paycheck to paycheck so I’m not great at this. 

Here is my current debt: 
$4200 medical credit card ($2900 of this is on an interest free plan that needs paid off by March 2020 or I’ll get interest put back on)
$1956 chase credit 
$1500 dental credit card 
$1054 capital one credit 

Then I have $22k in student loans (I know... awful). Unfortunately they aren’t my top priority at the moment though. 

I’m going to need a new car (not necessarily NEW but new to me) when my lease is up this winter. So potentially money for that, but I don’t have anything saved and no idea what I’ll get. 

I have $50 in savings and that’s it. Otherwise I live month to month and usually have just enough to cover bills each pay period. 

Where should this money go first? Savings? Paying something off? Which to pay? Interest rates are similar on each of those debts except my student loans, but like I said, not as concerned about those when I have crazy credit card debt. Sorry if this is a dumb question, that’s why I’m here. I struggle a LOT with wanting to enjoy my life while I’m young and healthy and kid-free but then the immense guilt of spending ANYTHING leisure related (even a drink or eating out) knowing I have mountains of debt.

personalfinance,Traditional vs Roth - Factors to Consider &amp; Rules of Thumb,"I see this question being asked all the time, is there a resource here that talks about how to assess which is better? I didn't see anything in the stickies. One piece of information I see people missing is considering the difference between marginal tax rate vs effective tax rate for Roth and Traditional contributions. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here are some major factors at play from my understanding, please feel free to correct me if I'm wrong on any of this:

* Taxes paid now on Roth contributions are paid at your highest marginal rate, and taxes paid in retirement on Traditional withdrawals are paid at your effective tax rate (overall average income taxes). You can use [this calculator](https://smartasset.com/taxes/income-taxes) (scroll to bottom of page for your specific state) to determine your current marginal and effective tax rates to compare.
* Roth contributions are generally good at low tax brackets (12% and below currently), and traditional contributions are usually superior when you're up to higher brackets (22% and higher)
* State residence also plays a major factor. You could potentially save \~10% in state income tax if you live in a state like Oregon (high income tax) then move to Washington or Texas (no income tax) in retirement, and make traditional contributions now. This also works in reverse to favor Roth contributions.
* There is benefit in having money in both Roth &amp; traditional, since it provides flexibility in retirement based on differing tax situations
* Roth IRA can function as pseudo-emergency fund, since contributions (not earnings) can be pulled out penalty-free. (Note: this is not advised to replace a proper emergency fund in an HYSA)
* Nobody knows what will happen with income taxes in the future. It's not likely they'll drop lower than we have today, and even if taxes rise in the future it could be in forms other than income tax, such as a VAT (Value Added Tax common in Europe, basically a federal sales tax). 
* *Side note*: An HSA (if applicable) can function effectively as a 401k in retirement, plus has added benefits such as entirely tax-free medical expenses. Payroll HSA contributions also reduce FICA taxes (as much as 7.65%). Many HSAs have very high fees though, so you'll want to rollover HSA investments to a low-fee provider (such as a Fidelity HSA). Also, some states tax contributions to HSAs, such as California.   

&amp;#x200B;

**My rules of thumb:** 

* Contribute to a Roth IRA at tax brackets 12% and below if you expect to significantly increase your income in retirement and/or or move to a state that has a much higher income tax
* Contribute to Traditional 401k or IRA at brackets 22% and above
* If you live in a state with high income taxes, this could dramatically shift the equation in favor of traditional contributions (or vice versa) 
* Use a mixture of both if possible for flexibility in retirement and to hedge against future tax uncertainty. 
* Roth IRA is superior to a Roth 401k due to extra versatility
* Max out a HSA if possible, especially if available through your employer via payroll. Be sure to rollover HSA investments to a low-fee HSA provider such as Fidelity.

I just moved back into my parents home in NJ for a new job and am not paying for rent/mortgage and try to chip in to buy things for the house, etc (misc. expenses above). I have no CC debt, I charge all the above expenses to my cards and pay my balances in full. I am currently on pace to max out my traditional 403b and my HSA, my Roth IRA is fully funded for the calendar year 2019 and my job does not have the opportunity for a megabackdoor Roth. Since I started this job late in the year, I am not eligible for the company 4% match for a 403b. I was wondering if I should contribute $0 to my traditional 403b for 2019 and raise my take-home paycheck to $3000 every 2 weeks and contribute an extra $3000/month to my student loan?

&amp;#x200B;

I know most people would advise against this due to the low interest rate but the loans are weighing down on me, mentally. It is also possible that in about 12 months I would be moving out and having a wedding around that time. I am estimating I am going to want somewhere in the ballpark of $10k cash on hand. Regardless of the decision that comes from this post, I would most likely refinance before moving out of my parents home to lower my minimum payment so I could pay rent elsewhere. Rent will be probably between $1000-1500/month. 

&amp;#x200B;

My questions for r/personalfinance:

If I take the route of contributing $0 to my 403b, once 2020 comes around, should I turn up my 403b contributions back to the maximum? 

How will contributing only \~$4000 to a traditional 401k/403b in 2019 affect (effect?) me come tax season next year?

What should I do? Help!

I want to get rid of this student loan as I see it as I am investing into making an extra $240/month.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

personalfinance,Question from an 18 yr old,"Hello! I’m a high school senior who will be attending university next year, and I wanted to get some opinions on my financial choices. 

1. It would be a good idea to open a credit card, right? I was looking at the Discover It Student Card, which seems to be widely recommended. Is there anything else I should do? 

2. I currently have a checking account with Chase but I do want to open a savings account so that I earn at least a bit of interest. Any recommendations? Also, my checking account is one linked with my dad’s, so should I also try to get my own independent account? 

3. In terms of paying for college, I have some choices to make. In particular, I know that I will accumulate about 20-25k in debt, but all those costs will be from my final two years, since my parents can cover my cost of attendance for the first two years. However, the federal loan limit (unsub) is 7.5k for my final two years, which means I would need to dip into private loans to cover the difference. I can do two things here:
        a) pay first two years and then take out a mix of federal and private loans for the final two OR b) I can take out federal loans for my first two years up to the limit (about 11k for those two years), which would let me push more of my savings towards the final two years and then be able to cover the difference with only federal loans. only problem I see is that I would be accumulating interest for those additional two years. 

4. Taking all the above into consideration, is there a point of opening an IRA right now? I’ve worked consistently for the last two years and make about 6k in income per year, which I currently just have lying around in my checking account + cash. I know paying for college is a priority, but I’ve also seen all those charts about the benefits of compound interest. I could open an account and contribute around 1-2k a year during college and put all my other savings towards tuition (since the college price estimate in 3 did not include working). I’m also going to a school that’s very professional and well regarded when it comes to internships, so I figure I could make quite a bit of money from summer internships, some of which I could put towards the IRA. 

Thank you so much :))))) I look forward to reading all of your responses!",finance

Bitcoin,6 simple ways you can help promote Bitcoin!,"6 simple ways we can all promote Bitcoin!

From the easiest and most passive to the most labour intensive method:

&amp;#x200B;

(1) Put a ""Use Bitcoin, Fiat is Dead!"" Logo Sticker on the side and/or back of your car. With only a minimal one off effort, whenever you are driving around you will be promoting Bitcoin! (Can also paste sticker to mum/dad/brother/sister/wife/husband/gf/bf/nephew/grandparents/neighbours/employees car to yield multiplier effect)

&amp;#x200B;

(2) Whenever you see or use a cash machine, put a Bitcoin sticker there. People will see it, and through time, the idea will register in their mind Bitcoin is money.

&amp;#x200B;

(3) When taking group pictures, hold out your phone which says ""Buy Bitcoin"" on the screen. Like what that guy behind Yellen did in the Federal Reserve meeting. When your friends share the picture on social media the idea will spread.

&amp;#x200B;

(4) Whenever you buy something from a shop, always ask the cashier ""May I please pay with Bitcoin?"" 

Depending on the environment, if the cashier says ""No"", you may choose to add ""Well ok I can pay you fiat but I do want to give you something of value in exchange of the item I am taking from you""

&amp;#x200B;

(5) Whenever you meet someone new, introduce yourself as a ""seasoned Bitcoin investor"". Openly educate the people who want to know more about Bitcoin/blockchain from you. Do try not to enter into any argument, just ignore the people who sneer at you, especially if they are jealous or clueless.

&amp;#x200B;

(6) Whenever you are on crowded public transport such as a bus or a train, speak on the phone loudly including sentences such as:

""Yes I totally understand about the intrinsic value of Bitcoin, I am buying two more this week"", 

""Yes I know Bitcoin price can fluctuate quite a bit, but it is a real asset unlike the USD, GBP or EUR where their issuers are loaded with trillions of debt""

""Bitcoin is up 800% since two years ago, which other asset will give you that kind of return?""

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

This is the last and least recommended method as an imaginary conversation really is difficult to perform all the time and you are only heard by 20 people max at any one time. Where as the car sticker method is the best and yields the highest effect.

personalfinance,Advice on Investment vs Debt Repayment Strategy,"I recently graduated from my masters program and am considering a high debt pay down strategy vs a high investment strategy and I keep talking myself in circles. I essentially have two options ($6,000/month to use; other expenses (tax, living, etc.) already accounted for). Numbers below have been rounded for simplicity sake. I have not bought a house yet, but will in the upcoming months.

Option 1: High Debt Pay Down
Student Loan repayment (6.5% interest rate currently with 5 year repayment; hoping to refinance lower): $2,500
Mortgage (assuming 3.5% 15 year): $2,000
401k: $1,000
Index Funds: $500

Option 2: High Investment
Student Loan repayment (6.5% interest rate currently with 10 year repayment; hoping to refinance lower): $1,500
Mortgage (assuming 4% 30 year): $1,200
401k: $1,000
Index Funds: $2,300

Is it better to get as much money in the market as possible as soon as possible, assuming that the long term compounding interest will overcome the interest rates of the student loans and mortgage payments? Or is it better to pay these debts off sooner to save interest expense and flip the payments into investments once my debts are paid off? Similarly, as my salary grows, should I put the additional money towards further debt pay down or towards increased investment?",finance

personalfinance,Where is post deduction tax and why is it only sometimes applied to my check?,"I have a corporate jobs with benefits. Every patch check certain things are deducted from my check. These are pre tax deductions and employee taxes which include things like state tax, federal withholding, Medicare...etc. Then there is a post tax deduction but oddly this adds to my check. 

Example if I gross pay was $1000, pre tax deductions are $50, employee taxes are $400, and post tax deductions are $250, then my net pay would amount to $800.

My question is why is the added and not deducted. Also is it normal for post tax deductions to only happen occasionally in pay?",finance
personalfinance,Using Renttrack for credit reporting?,"I just got an email from my rental company for the house I rent and they're offering a credit reporting service called renttrack that reports my rent to the credit bureau. My husband and I have a few credit cards, loans, car payments etc to build up credit so we can buy a house next year. My credit is just under 700 and his is just over 700.
The advertisement claims: Sign up to receive all these benefits for the low monthly subscription fee of $6.95. The instant credit option to go back in credit history up to 24 months is an additional one-time fee of $50. On average, users see their credit score increase by +29 points after only two months of rent reporting. Scores can even increase up to 132+ points in two years.


I'd love to build up our credit so we get the best interest rate on a home, would it be worth it to sign up, pay the $50 to get the last 24 months of rent reported and keep reporting until we close on a house next year?",finance

personalfinance,Taking out a loan to pay off credit card debt?,"Okay so here me out: I am 19 and I don’t have a ton of credit card debt compared to the average joe. I’m about $3,000 in credit card debt due to various emergencies I had financially. $2,000 of it is Best Buy because I needed a laptop for my former job and I have 1 Discover card with a $500 limit and a bank card that I’m going to close that also has a $500 limit. 

So here’s my thinking: If I can take out a personal loan or a credit consolidation loan, pay off the credit cards. My credit score is low only because of the credit cards utilization. That’ll bring my credit utilization down to zero, which will make my credit score happy. I will have a lower interest rate because my current credit cards have a 24%+ interest rate. Once I pay this loan off, I’m hoping it’s going to add to my credit history and show I was able to successfully pay off a loan. Since I need to try and get student loans by this fall, I really, really need as much credit history as possible. What do you guys think?",finance
personalfinance,"Bought My First Car, Planning On Paying It Off In One Year...Need Tips or Advice","I bought my first car, a 2018 Nissan Kicks, and I have a car loan of about $16,300.

I (20F) work full time and currently live with my mother, and I have no other expenses.

I plan on moving out in a year or two (preferably a year) and so the idea is that because I want as less expenses to deal with when I move out on my own for the first time, im going to try to pay this car off in a year, if not less while Im able to living at home.

Every other week all my of my weekly paycheck will go to the car (about $450/week, so b/t 800 - 900 per month) and my mother (bless her soul) is giving me $500 to contribute to the first payment, and offered to contribute $112/month (i didnt ask her to do this, she personally offered to). I went to the bank and they said making a payment in the middle of the month resets interest rate, and so I plan on putting $450 every other week instead of the $900 a month. If I keep this up after 6 months im going to refinance and get a lower interest rate (current 9.44%).

Same banker also just happened to work for the loan company I'm with and use to sell cars, told me this was a great plan. Is there any way I can make this better or am I good?",finance

personalfinance,Question about Real Estate Crowdfunding...with a Roth IRA twist.,"When looking around for a better and more stable rate of return for my Roth IRA and SDBA with minimal risk  I stumbled upon this site [https://securedincomegroup.com/](https://securedincomegroup.com/)

I'm sure there are many sites like this...but this particular outfit is close enough to where I live that I can drive there and meet with an advisor in person (which is why I'm seriously considering it). They claim to pay out a fixed interest rate over several different terms that are better than any CD I've seen. The kicker is that you can also transfer your Roth IRA into their platform to take advantage of said rates. After reading through the initial prospectus on their homepage it seems kind of like other platforms like Fundrise or RealtyMogul, but with a fixed yield. Instead of investing in actual properties they provide bridge loans to builders and developers. They also claim to take no fees. You can contribute additional capital any time and roll over dividends to max out appreciation. Am I missing something here or is this a decent investment vehicle? Could I be doing better elsewhere?

personalfinance,"Refinancing Mortgage, beneficial? California","1st time homeowner. I've had my home for 1 year now. Got solicited for a refinance. On paper it looks beneficial, however, I just wanted to make sure I wasn't getting scammed or anything since it sounds to good to be true. Here are the specifics:

Original loan amount: 637,500
Annual Interest Rate: 4.875%
30 Years, 12 payments a year
Scheduled payment: $3,373.70 (360 payments)
Total Interest: $577,032.87

Interest Paid to date: $30,865

Beginning Balance for New Loan: $627,880.65
New Interest rate 4.375%, 30 years, 12 pmts a year, 360 
pmts.
Scheduled payment: $3,134,92
Total interest: $500,688.

Now if my analysis is correct, and please correct me if I'm wrong, total interest of the refinanced loan would be $500,688 PLUS the $30,865 = $531,553, which is still lower than the original interest amount of $577,032. 

Common sense says this is beneficial and that I should refinance....but like I said, I've only been a homeowner for 1 year and wanted to make sure that my thought process above is correct. The lender did mention that he is trying to make it a no-cost refinance and that the the new APR would be lower than 4.375% and that that was the worse case scenario APR.

personalfinance,Should I borrow money from myself (retirement account) to pay off credit card debt?,"Hi Personal Finance - over the last couple of years I've been working very diligently to get my credit in order and pay off my debt. I was very nearly there until I did my taxes this year and had the biggest tax bill of my life - almost $5K. I opted to pay using a rewards card (I didn't have $5,000 in cash.)

Now I'm wondering if I should borrow the money from myself (my retirement account) to pay off this credit card debt? I can borrow at 6% (versus almost 18% on my cc) and pay the debt back over the course of 12 months. Of course, the downside is that it takes that money out of the market for the next year. 

I intend to pay this off aggressively and likely wouldn't need the whole 12 months but the lower interest rate is very appealing to me. There are fees of about $53 associated with borrowing this money from my Fidelity account.

I'll keep it short, there are two things I am wondering if make sense; she is eligible for federal loans even though she is working (technically counts as a class in her program). I think it would make sense for her to take out the full amount (50k) and pay it all towards her private loans which carry a higher interest rate (she has about 100k in PL) .

personalfinance,Pension to IRA - Calculating if it's the right move,"Hey all - it's so hard to find info on what to do with pensions because they are a thing of the past. I'm trying figure out what to do with mine from a former employer.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 32 years old. I have $21k total in a pension (former employer), receiving 4% interest on principal only of $19k as long as I keep it there. The interest rate can fluctuate between 4% and 8%, but it's been around 4% for a while now, I'm assuming it stays at that rate.

* If I retire in 2052 (age 65), plan will pay $565/month until I die.
* If I commence the plan early (now), $89/month until I die.

&amp;#x200B;

Assumptions:

* I live until age 90 (25 years of pension after age 65).
* Company is still around when I retire aka funds still available (it's an electric utility company, I think it will still be around in some shape or form).

&amp;#x200B;

How do I determine what's best to do with my pension?

1. Pull out lump sum and invest in an IRA with index funds (if so, what % of return do I need to bank on for 33 years)?
2. Just keep it there until distributions kick in, in about 33 years.
3. Take monthly distributions now (don't need the money, throwing this option in because its available).

&amp;#x200B;

Notes:

* I max my 401k and Roth IRA every year using total market index funds (US, intl, bonds mix).
* Already have 6 mo emergency fund
* Still saving 10% per paycheck
* Don't have any plans for any other retirement brokerage accounts, going to leverage real estate investments next, so saving cash for that.

i am entering an income driven repayment plan, **REPAYE. i will owe $0 each month for my first year of residency.** obviously, this will not touch the interest that accrues. the benefit of REPAYE is the associated interest subsidy:  the govt will subsidize the different between what i pay and the accruing interest. in fact, ***for the first three years, the govt will pay half the difference on unsubsidized loans.*** **all of my loans are unsubsidized**, ***so this payment plan will effectively halve my interest rate for the first three years, 2.8%***

&amp;#x200B;

**now, the tricky part... i'm going to be living at home** with parents for the first 1-2 years of residency. **for the coming year, i can easily max a roth IRA and put 25-30K towards my loans. however, if i pay beyond the exact $0/ month i owe, i lose the interest subsidy. (source:**  [https://www.whitecoatinvestor.com/repaye-interest-subsidy/](https://www.whitecoatinvestor.com/repaye-interest-subsidy/) ) 

&amp;#x200B;

**therefore, my question is should i direct that 25-30k towards my loans and lose my interest subsidy OR invest in my 403b with no match OR create a high yield savings account to put that money in?**

personalfinance,I need assistance in choosing an appropriate (out-of-state) ABLE Account 🙏🏼,"I am about to receive $3,000 in backpay from SSI and will be putting it in an ABLE account (for myself). I really need help determining which state, and then which plan to choose from...

I am limited to the states that allow out-of-state residents to open an account. I am 27 years old, disabled, and intend to invest as much as I can to make use of the $100,000 limit before my benefits become affected. I will not be touching the account for the next 5 years (hopefully 10) for sure, ideally this will be to save for a car, or more importantly a house.

My goal is to contribute the initial $3k, and a solid $300-400/month from here on out. My parents may contribute a couple thousand over the years as well. The part where I need help is weighing out the cost/benefit between: annual fees, interest rates, my initial investment, return on investment, which plan is appropriate, risk, etc.

I’m probably looking at a moderate or aggressive growth option, correct? I’m hung up on annual fees versus the interest rates. Please help me chose the right plan in the right state. 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼",finance

personalfinance,Taking over my parents' mortgage,"So my parents want me to take over their mortgage (\~300k), meaning refinancing/taking out my own loan, while they still pay for it. They believe this will be beneficial for all of us, as I can probably get a lower interest rate due to better credit, and I can also get a tax break since I earn more than them.

&amp;#x200B;

A little background- my parents are getting older and are struggling with the payments. They bought the house for $560k, and it's now worth $1.1mil. If I get a lower interest rate and an extended loan term, their monthly payments will decrease, so they could actually keep the house. I also make about 130k/yr before taxes, so this will be a nice tax break, according to them. I genuinely know they're not trying to screw me over.

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice on how to proceed and things to consider? Thanks in advance.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Update\*\* After consulting with my parents, they have decided to sell the home, move a couple hours away and downsize. Even with a lower interest rate/refinancing, they will eventually be unable to afford the home in the future, and we'll be back in the same predicament. I feel extremely guilty and selfish by not agreeing to simply live with them and assist them with paying off the remaining 300k, but I have other goals in mind (not in California), and I am not ready for such a responsibility. I just hope they don't think any less of me after this. Thank you to everyone for your advice.",finance

personalfinance,Dip into emergency savings for a car?,"I consider myself a novice with finances so I need advice please!

Have an emergency savings- We have enough for three months \~$10K, and a little extra \~$4K (so 14K in savings altogether)

I have an 790 credit score

I have no debt

Tomorrow my husband and I are going to buy a used truck that's an excellent deal (after we have it checked out by a mechanic, of course.)

My husband wants to cash out some investments that were left to him and trade in his car. I'm on board with that, but he also wants to dip into our emergency savings so we can finance for less.

I think we should leave that $10 alone and finance more. I think I should get us a pretty low interest rate and figure we can make extra payments. 

Before we go in a make a deal, what is the smarter choice?

CryptoCurrency,Is this really what you want?,"I've been engaged with the cryptosphere since almost the very beginning: immediately seeing bitcoin for what it was, a way to securely store wealth outside of the banking system, freed from relying on a middleman who, it became clear over time, was more interested in policing my (and everyone else) actions to make sure their ass was covered with the increasingly noisy regulators, and due to their financial irresponsibility, always coming up with new and progressively more ridiculous fees.

I was fed up with the old system already, having explored the black magic of infinite inflationable monies, centralized, communist-style administration of entire economies, and all the suffering, surveillance, corruption, and centralization of power that such things necessarily entail.

Some Rothschild or Rockefeller said it best, ""give me control of a nations money supply and I care not who makes the laws"" - or something to that extent.

Anyway, the allure for the very early adopters was being able to sidestep the massive fiat scam, put personal financial destiny squarely in our own hands, and not rely on third parties as much as possible.

In the beginning Bitcoin was almost completely ignored. Only some ubernerds and a few drug dealers and drug users (who would like nothing more than peacefully transact between each other and mutually benefit from the exchange by the way, but are forced into dark corners of the internet because of arcane, politically-motivated, outdated drug laws that FINALLY appear to be crumbling to pieces after DECADES of propaganda and lies organized by major world governments and their lackeys) knew about it.

Unfortunately most people lack imagination and, the nerds being mostly quiet and the drug-related activity soon being used as a justification to slam bitcoin with the ""only for crime"" label, most people thought nothing else of it.

They could not see, and to this day still don't see, the immense potential that cryptocurrency can bring the world.

There are more of you out there now who can, this is self-evident. Although frankly too many of you are here for gains mostly/only, and fail to see what cryptocurrency is really all about.

Much like how so many people think the Internet is facebook and instagram and twitter. Which is so shockingly ignorant it almost makes my blood boil.

Look, gains are nice, and of course we all want to make some money. I won't even fault you for taking profits, to me this seems like a sensible hedge, even a full decade into the cryptocurrency experiment, nothing is guaranteed, nothing is certain. So it makes sense to diversify, even - gasp - into fiat money that we can - hopefully - put to good use, today, in the ""real"" world.

But to get back to the story - quickly then, from a very underground thing that almost nobody knew about, Bitcoin was attacked as being ""only for criminals"", and there was a palpable sense of apprehension and fear from international organizations and governments.

Here was this thing that entirely sidestepped the financial system that keeps their funny monies going, and people were using the technology to emancipate themselves from arbitrary limitations and appalling mass-surveillance.

And once a state gets used to mass-surveillance, it is very hard to get it to stop. The power is simply immense.

Can you imagine? A database with the social connections of every citizen, what they like reading, the sites they like visiting, their physical location logged nonstop, painting very detailed pictures of peoples' lives.

All of their posts online, neatly tucked away in some searchable massive database.

Almost no one protested. ""Well, I have nothing to hide"", they said. And thus the surveillance state grew and grew, almost entirely unchallenged.

In the name of ""fighting terrorism"", ""catching pedos"" and ""removing drugs from society"" (I could write volumes on this last one alone but this is not the time or the place) we saw our liberties and privacy being steadily eroded, particularly after the perfect excuse happened on September 11 2001.

Boy oh boy did we see a destruction of civil liberties since then.


Another part of this mass-surveillance was, and is, the banking system. Put simply, every transaction you make is under surveillance, recorded indefinitely. The reasoning? It *could* be related to financing terrorism.

That appears to be the great corrosive thought behind all of this.

You *could* be making a transaction to fund terrorism.

You *could* be spewing ""hate speech"" (who gets to define it? apparently these days it means expressing right-leaning opinions - tomorrow, who knows?) on social media, so better record everything you write.

You *could* be visiting ""extremist"" sites online, and because clearly this means you must be an extremist-in-training and not just some curious human trying to understand why on earth someone would have such wicked ideas, your internet activity is logged and analyzed.

You use Tor or a VPN? Oh dear, *now* it's really clear that you must be *a potential criminal*. Otherwise you would have nothing to hide.

*Right* ?

Do you see the pattern?

To bring it back to cryptocurrency, Bitcoin users, it is known, were also targeted for increased attention by certain intelligence agencies. Same logic - you were not happy with using the mass-surveilled financial system of yesterdecade? Probably a criminal in the making.

Eventually though, that air of fear and apprehension more or less vanished. Regulators actually begun to realize that **bitcoin is entirely transparent**!

All you have to do is require KYC at strategic points. People thought you were crazy for saying KYC would come to crypto. But it was so obvious.

And you know what else is obvious? Once exchanges are keeping KYC, global regulators will require that they exchange information with them. This, recent news tell us, is already set in motion and will soon be a reality.

Given the transparent nature of most blockchain projects, the implications are so obvious that the fact that almost no one sees what's coming next is almost enough for me to lose hope in humanity.

Once there is a centralized record of who owns which addresses, several things become possible.

You can now put people under surveillance in real time while they do their transparent chain business (.. shocking, right). You can tell who they transact with, and how often. You can censor their transactions, if not at the network level, at the merchant and exchange levels.

And you can do something else too, which is to automatically treat any and all bitcoin addresses not associated with a known real identity as *potential money laundering* (remember the pattern?).

All of this information being available will **inevitably** create a reality where you **will** be asked questions about what you do with your money. And this time it isn't the bank, it comes straight from higher up. Because **every transaction is fucking PUBLIC!**.

Who did you send 0.5 BTC to on day X ? This address is not known to us. Please explain (or else).

Why did you attempt to mix your coins? *Have you got something to hide?*

Do you enjoy swapping coins in accountless sites like morphtoken ? Well, enjoy while it lasts, because it is a certainty that they will soon be forced to force you to put your identity at risk of being stolen, or else - you guessed it - they are helping with laundering funds.

You think tools like wasabi wallet will help? On a transparent chain?

If by now you cannot tell that the only thing this will accomplish is an automated blacklist of your coins because *you must be trying to hide something but not allowing the State to track your every financial transaction on the chain*, there is not much hope left for you. That is simply a massive failure of the imagination, and I lack the words to make the consequences of your ignorance any more obvious.

I'm one of those ""privacy nuts"" you sometimes hear about. 15 years ago I was telling people that it was a really bad idea to be donating so much personal information to some company, but nobody would listen. Already too hooked on getting attention and feeling validated. What's sacrificing a little privacy to feel good - who cares if the tech company is making millions selling your every weakness, your private thoughts, your tastes and opinions, to third parties who somehow, for some reason, are very very keen in acquiring this data.

Baffling how people could not see how valuable this data would become. Today it seems they are beginning to wake up.

Meanwhile, the entire Internet has been boobytrapped, and in the unending fight to get rid of pedos, drugs and terrorists, we all live under mass-surveillance and almost everyone pretty much accepts it without questioning things too much.

After all, there don't seem to be many consequences.

But that's just a failure of the imagination.

**By accepting, uncritically, that transparent chains are a good foundation with which to build the new financial system**, you are all voting for more surveillance, the automatic criminalization of privacy, suspicion by default, and subjecting yourselves to 24/7, algorithmic mass-surveillance.

Physical cash is already on the way out in some parts of the world, and this is no accident. It is much harder to trace cash, and at this point the fourth excuse to do away with that pesky stuff - civil liberties - comes into play.

The digitization of everything financial, the accompanying mass-surveillance and mass-ingestion of the data is necessary, you see, to catch *tax evaders*.

After all (and you will remember the pattern for sure), if you desire some financial privacy, if you would prefer to keep your economic activity to yourself, you are a *potential tax evader*.

It should go without saying, and even including this paragraph I suspect there will be many comments by people with short attention spans who will accuse me of encouraging *tax evasion*. Ah, how deep the brainwash goes.

To that I would say, just think about the fact that up to until only a few decades ago (in thousands of years of history) it was not even possible to do financial mass-surveillance.

And somehow roads were built, civilizations thrived, and there's a direct ancestry right to us.

And yet we are told that only by stripping everyone of privacy could the state ever hope to collect tax.

**Bullshit**.

Look, you have to ask yourself, **is this really what you want** ? A world of mass-surveillance where all aspects of our life are neatly categorized and searchable in some state-controlled database (that will *never* be hacked, *right* ? hint: shadowbrokers)

Can't you see it? Have you been anesthetized?

Are you too numb to see?

**This is totalitarianism**. Pure and simple. It's happened so gradually that somehow it seems the world has failed to notice.

It is not right for things to be this way. If you would stop distracting yourself with social media, tv series and porn (and whatever else young people distract themselves with these days) you would come to develop this notion.

**Cryptocurrency was all about personal freedom**. I am sorry to say that  the technology has been almost entirely successfully adapted to do the exact opposite.

Rather than offer us freedom, it serves as perfect, immutable evidence of all of our economic activity, whatever little privacy it offered crushed by off-chain measures like KYC and guilty-until-proven-innocent techniques that would have made the STASI proud.

**But not all is lost, yet**.

Fortunately we already have the technology to make on-chain privacy a reality. **It's called Monero and it works today**.

I'm not going to babysit you through this and I'm not going to tell you to just trust my word for it, but I am going to tell you that **if you care about a future where financial privacy is a reality, a future where the state and powerful corporations don't keep tabs on every transaction you make, every cent you receive, from whom and how often, with perfect accuracy, where automatically they know where you spend your money**.. if you care about a future where you are not a slave to some financial master who insists on its right to observe to the most minute detail every aspect of your financial life (and as we have seen, many other aspects of life too - financial mass-surveillance is after all a subset of mass-surveillance itself)..

Then you owe it to yourself to read about Monero.

Transactions cost less than a cent, and on-chain privacy is a reality. Today.

Will it be the ultimate financial privacy project? This I cannot know. I can tell you that it is the best chance we got today.

Ultimately it does not matter to me which project makes financial privacy a staple. All I care about is that we, the peoples of the world, are able to transact with each other freely, without the assumption of wrongdoing, without being asked questions about or dealings and who we decide to do business with, before there is any evidence of foul play.

That is what is happening today, and it is a very palpable thing that outside of certain niches like VPN providers, Monero adoption is very lackluster.

**They are afraid**. People hear ""privacy-preserving money"" and think ""headaches from the state"". This is a shame.

This cowardice will, unless reversed, soon enough plunge us into a world where our masters know everything about us, and can with the press of a button blacklist, deplatform, defund, and otherwise shut us up.

Applied knowledge is power, and so is information. If you know everything about everyone, you have **tremendous** power over everyone.

This reality must be stopped at all costs, if we want freedom and individual liberty to survive.

Surveillance coins (99.999% of them) are not the answer to this most concerning of trends.

Stand up for your rights. Use Tor, use VPNs, encrypt your email, encrypt your communications, and **use privacy preserving cryptocurrency such as Monero**.

Don't be afraid. There's strength in numbers.

Never forget who ultimately gives legitimacy to laws. If enough people come to think that weed ought to be legal, then in countries where the government is still somewhat under the control of the people, it will be so.

You are probably sitting at home reading this. In the privacy of your home. That should be sacred. And yet, if you decide to visit certain sites like torproject.org or getmonero.org after you read this, automated actions behind your back will be taken. Increased scrutiny will be placed on you - ""*who is this person, that wants to protect their privacy?*

It is hard to convey in words just how evil, misguided and stifling this is. You may say I'm exaggerating, in which case only one word for you: SNOWDEN. And by the way, it was pretty damn obvious before his revelations that something of the sort was happening.

Like it is obvious now with surveillance coins (transparent blockchains).

Today it's KYC, tomorrow is automated chain analysis, the day after it's endless questions about who you're transacting with (updating the central registry based on the answers), and when your debt-ridden, socialist-leaning state finally pulls a Venezuela on you, it's open season.

Let's try to put a stop to this while we can, shall we? The beast will not grow tamer if we keep ceding ground.

The beast sometimes needs to be reminded of who's *really* in control.

**Privacy is not a crime**. It is our birthright. We have the right and the basic dignity to transact with one another, without the Eye of Staton gazing upon us.

&gt; No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to attacks upon his honour and reputation. Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks.

&gt; https://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/

It is on us, and future generations will hold us accountable, if privacy falls worldwide and the state controls every aspect of our life, and comes uninvited to ask questions under threat of force if we refuse on principle to comply.

Stop getting distracted. Educate yourself, never stop learning, and do what you can to make this world a better place.

More state control ain't the way.",cryptocurrency

I hope everyone made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and are ready for the new holiday-shortened trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning May 27th, 2019.

# **Trade and the economy have become the new roller coaster for markets  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/24/trade-and-the-economy-have-become-the-new-roller-coaster-for-markets.html)**
*****
&gt; Trade headlines could be a big factor for markets in the week ahead, but investors will also be attuned to fresh inflation data and moves in the bond market, which is flashing new worries about the economy.
*****
&gt; Stocks were on a roller coaster ride in the past week, as markets reacted to worsening trade tensions and concerns that negotiations could be prolonged, causing pain for the global economy. But the bond market’s move was perhaps even more dramatic, as yields, which move opposite of price, fell to levels last seen in 2017, and the futures market began to price in three Fed interest rate cuts by the end of next year.
*****
&gt; “There’s not a lot of economic data next week, so events hang over us,” said Marc Chandler, chief global strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex. “It’s more about the evolution of old issues than new issues, like trade and Brexit.”
*****
&gt; Brexit will continue to be a focus in global markets. U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May stepped aside Friday after failing to get agreement on a plan for the U.K. to leave the European Union. Chandler said investors will be watching the jockeying among candidates hoping to succeed Prime Minister May, with hard line Brexit proponent Boris Johnson expected to seek the job, among others.
*****
&gt; As for trade, Chandler said it’s possible that President Donald Trump’s comments that Huawei could be part of a trade deal may be the start of a new approach by the administration to tone down its rhetoric. The telecom giant has been blacklisted by the U.S. and is expected to be denied access to U.S. components for its equipment.
*****
&gt; “In some ways, it’s a headline problem. We think of it more as event risk,” said Nadine Terman, CEO and CIO at Solstein Capital. “China thinks in dynasties and U.S. investors seem to think in durations of days and months, so I think we are misunderstanding the duration of their negotiating strategy.”
*****
&gt; She said the issues between the two countries go way beyond trade and extend to China’s military aspirations in the South China Sea and its global campaign of influence through the Belt and Road initiative, Chinese President Xi Jinping’s signature program.
*****
&gt; “It’s now become more nationalistic, emotional, to say: ‘We’re going against the U.S. and we’ve got to be in it for the long haul.’ I don’t think you have the same emotion here in the U.S. You don’t have the same nationalistic pride to say ‘we have to fight China at all cost,’” she said.
*****
&gt; In the past week, Wall Street increasingly began to expect the Trump administration to turn up the pressure on China with another wave of 25% tariffs on the $300 billion or so in goods remaining that have no tariffs. Those tariffs would directly hit American consumer goods and are expected to take a bigger bite out of the economy.
*****
&gt; Fears of a trade war hurting global growth and concerns that the U.S. is already beginning to weaken were evident in the bond market. Treasury yields reflected lowered growth expectations. The 10-year hit a low of 2.29% on Thursday and was at 2.32% Friday.
*****
&gt; J.P. Morgan economists Friday downgraded their view of the economy, slicing second quarter growth to just 1% from an earlier forecast of 2.25% and first quarter growth of 3.2%. The economists blamed weak U.S. manufacturing data and said risks were signs of weakness in the global economy and also indications that the trade war was hurting business sentiment.
*****
&gt; “The concerns the markets have right now are that we’re moving towards a worst case scenario, and that could persist for quite some time,” said Mark Cabana, head of U.S. short rate strategy at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. “If that’s the case, then the market is believing economic data, and the Fed will likely need to respond to that by trying to offset and prevent a recession.”
*****
&gt; The most important data point in the coming week will be Friday’s personal consumption expenditures, which includes the PCE deflator inflation data that the Fed monitors. It was at 1.6% year-over-year last month, and is expected to be the same for April, well below the Fed’s target of 2% inflation.
*****
&gt; Inflation has become a key focus on Wall Street, particularly after Fed Chair Jerome Powell said low inflation appears to be transitory and not enough of a concern to make the Fed cut interest rates. Powell and other Fed officials have stressed the Fed is pausing in its rate hiking cycle, is monitoring the economy and does not yet know which way it will move next.
*****
&gt; Solstein Capital’s Terman said she is watching the PCE inflation report to see if it confirms her view that inflation and the economy will be weaker this summer.
*****
&gt; She also expects the markets to be choppy, and by late summer, around its annual Jackson Hole symposium, the Fed could indicate it could cut interest rates.
*****
&gt; “People are going to start getting even more concerned this summer about the U.S.,” Terman said.
*****
&gt; Terman said she has been positioned for lower inflation and slower GDP growth with key holdings in utilities, REITs, Treasurys and gold.
*****
&gt; “What would do well this summer? Staples, utilities, health care, REITs. You want fixed income. You want to be underweight tech, energy, financials and industrials,” she said.
*****
&gt; There is also home prices data Tuesday and advanced economic indicators Thursday. That comes in addition to a few earnings reports, including Costco, Ulta Beauty and Dollar General.
*****
&gt; Markets will also be watching the outcome of European parliamentary elections, and if there is a strong showing by populists, there could be a negative impact on the euro and risk assets.

# S&amp;P 500 Down Four Straight Day After Memorial Day

&gt; Our office will be closed for observance of Memorial Day on Monday, May 27. U.S stock and bond markets will also be closed. As you spend some quality time off with family and friends please take time to commemorate those who have paid the ultimate price while serving in the U.S. military.

&gt; For decades the Stock Trader’s Almanac has been tracking and monitoring the market’s performance around holidays. The trading day after Memorial Day has a mixed record going back to 1971. Both S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ have declined more often than risen on the day, but average performance is still positive. Since 1986, the frequency of gains has improved, and average performance has also risen however, over the last four years S&amp;P 500 has declined. The second trading day after Memorial Day has since more advances than declines, but average performance is negative for NASDAQ. The third day after appears to have the best long- and short-term record combined with solid average performance.

# The Bespoke Report - It's All Relative

&gt; Hut, Hut, Cut! With weaker economic data to contend with this week on both a domestic and international basis, plus escalating tensions between the US and China, investors are increasingly pricing in a higher likelihood of rate cuts from the FOMC before the year is out. Through mid-day Friday, the Fed Fund futures market was pricing in over an 85% chance of a rate cut between now and the January 2020 meeting. Those are the kind of odds that would make James Holzhauer say ""All in.""

# Fed Members Side With “Transitory” Inflation

&gt; Investors just got more details on Federal Reserve (Fed) policymakers’ views of inflation.

&gt; Minutes of the Fed’s most recent meeting, which ended May 1, showed that “many participants” considered slowing consumer inflation as “transitory,” and agreed that the Fed’s current patient approach should help stoke economic growth and inflation. Policymakers’ optimistic view on inflation runs counter to a growing opinion in financial markets that slowing growth in core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) could warrant lower rates.

&gt; Markets think the grace period for a “transitory” excuse has passed, but data show it’s too soon to tell. Another measure of inflation, the Fed Bank of Dallas’s “trimmed mean” PCE measure, points to higher pricing pressures ahead. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the trimmed mean PCE, which has proven to be a less volatile version of core PCE, has hit 2% year-over-year growth for the past several months.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Slowing-Core-PCE-Due-Transitory-Factors.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; “It’s tough to make a case for lower rates with over 3% gross domestic product growth, healthy wage growth, and a labor market close to full employment,” said LPL Research Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch. “If consumer inflation picks up, the U.S. economy will be near full employment with healthy inflation across the board, fulfilling the Fed’s dual mandate.”

&gt; Of course, much has happened on the global front since the Fed’s last meeting. Trade tensions have flared up again, with the United States raising tariff rates on $200 billion of Chinese imports and threatening to increase rates on the remaining swath of goods. Logically, tariffs should be a catalyst for higher consumer inflation, as higher costs should boost price growth. However, the opposite has happened over the past few months, and there are several factors to consider when thinking about future inflation.

&gt; Overall, we don’t see a strong argument for a rate cut right now, and we side with the Fed in thinking consumer inflation could pick up as wage growth accelerates and growth stabilizes. At the very least, it’s becoming more obvious the Fed doesn’t have enough clarity to move policy in either direction.

# Another Reason For Bulls To Smile

&gt; The S&amp;P 500 Index has officially gained each of the first four months of the year for the first time since 2013. This comes on the heels of the best first quarter since 1998. Six straight months in green has been the best monthly win streak to start a year, and that last happened in 1996.

&gt; Starting a year with strength like this historically has been a good sign, even though stocks in May saw a nearly 5% correction.

&gt; “Although we wouldn’t be surprised to see continued volatility over the coming months, the good news is a great start to a year has had a funny way of eventually resolving higher,” explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “In fact, the rest of the year has been higher an incredible 14 out of 15 times after the first four months were in the green!”

&gt; As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, the S&amp;P 500 returns the rest of the year (final 8 months) have been more than twice as strong as the average year returns—10% versus 4.7%—following four straight monthly gains to kick off a new year. There’s always a catch though, and in this case we’ve seen an average pullback of more than 8% the rest of the year.

# Earnings Season Takeaways

&gt; We consider earnings season a success based on the amount of upside to prior estimates generated by S&amp;P 500 Index companies despite several headwinds. Companies handily beat expectations to get first quarter earnings up to flat, as shown in the LPL Chart of the Day.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Looks-like-we%E2%80%99ll-avert-an-Earnings-recession.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; When earnings season began in mid-April, consensus estimates called for a 4–5% drop in S&amp;P 500 earnings, according to FactSet data. Beating results by this much is impressive considering persistent trade uncertainty and the drag on overseas profits from a strong U.S. dollar. Also consider that the median stock in the S&amp;P 500 has grown earnings several percentage points faster because a few large companies are dragging down the market-cap-weighted calculation.

&gt; Resilient estimates are also encouraging. Since April 15, the 2019 consensus estimate for S&amp;P 500 earnings per share has risen slightly to $168 (a 4% year-over-year increase). We consider that a win given that estimates typically fall during earnings season.

&gt; “Escalating trade uncertainty and the threat of more tariffs are huge wild cards for corporate profits,” said LPL Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch. “We are hopeful that significant progress can be made on the trade front next month, when President Trump and China’s President Xi are expected to meet at the G20 summit. A prolonged impasse that lasts through the summer would make mid-single-digit earnings growth difficult to achieve in 2019.”

&gt; Our base case remains that we will get a trade deal with China early this summer and consensus expectations for 3–4% earnings growth may prove to be conservative. Earnings are hardly booming, but with a continued economic expansion, low inflation, and low interest rates, we see enough earnings growth ahead to push stocks up to our year-end S&amp;P 500 fair value target of 3,000—though it probably won’t get there in a straight line.

# Pre-election Year June: Tech and Small-caps Best

&gt; June has shone brighter on NASDAQ stocks over the last 48 years as a rule ranking eighth with a 0.6% average gain, up 26 of 48 years. This contributes to NASDAQ’s “Best Eight Months” which ends in June. June ranks near the bottom on the Dow Jones Industrials just above September since 1950 with an average loss of 0.3%. S&amp;P 500 performs similarly poorly, ranking tenth, but essentially flat (–0.02% average). Small caps also tend to fare well in June. Russell 2000 has averaged 0.6% in the month since 1979.

&gt; In pre-election years since 1950, June ranks no better than mid-pack. June is the #8 DJIA month in pre-election years averaging a 0.8% gain with a record of nine advances in seventeen years. For S&amp;P 500, June is #5 with an average gain of 1.2% (10-7 record). Pre-election year June ranks #6 for NASDAQ and #7 for Russell 2000 with average gains of 1.9% and 1.1% respectively. Recent pre-election year Junes in 2015, 2011 and 2007 were troublesome for the market as DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ all declined (Russell 2000 eked out a modest gain in 2015).

stocks,Fedex....,"This stock is killing me! I've been averaging down throughout this whole dip and I see it as a relatively cheap stock right now at it's current orice. But I just can't force myself to buy any further right now. I initially got in at around 230 not that long ago. Current price is at 159... I got my average down to 201 but just can't convince myself to put anymore in to get that average down further.

I'm not even looking for advice. I know I'm going to baghold this shitshow until I'm in the green at some point (probably 3 years down the line or some bullshit)...
I just want you guys to tell me that it'll be ok. Averaging down is a genius move. And that buffet would be proud of me",finance

personalfinance,"Student loans went into deferment automatically because I'm taking grad school courses, but my employer is paying for my masters in full. Are there any downsides to keeping them in deferment and paying my loans down at an accelerated rate? Currently sitting at 93K.","Good morning PF! Wall of text incoming, this has been a summary of my headspace the past week.

Graduated in 2016 from a in-state public school with over 100k student loans if you can believe it. There is one large loan in my name, and several under my parents under Parent Plus Loans. I knew I would be paying those Parent Plus Loans off even though they are under my parents name, so that's not an issue for me. My question today is how to deal with deferment of all the loans and if this could be used to my benefit to pay down my student loans faster with less money spent on interest over time. If there are no benefits, I'll fax in a form to get the automatic deferment removed.

Currently working as an engineer for a large company. I put up to my employer match in my 401k, they also add additional funds to my 401k on top of my match. I have a large emergency fund with some other savings in a high interest savings account so I'm willing to throw more into my loans. Still being under 26, I'm on my parents health insurance and on their cell phone plan. My car is paid off in full with no plans to get a new one anytime soon. They live in a different state 2 hours away, so I cannot live there rent free. Here are some other stats that could be helpful.

Salary: $85,000

Paycheck every Friday: $1,091

Rent (I split with my partner): $675

Other Utilities/expenses and recurring payments: ~$410
(Car insurance, $56, Internet, $22.50, Electric, $30, Gym, $25, Gas, $100, Pet, $25, Groceries, $150)

Putting these mandatory expenses like this makes me realize that my credit card bill is filled with unnecessary expenses like going out to eat and things, but I always pay my balance in full every month.

My pay has increased from 67K to 85K in a little over a year after a promotion and market adjustment. I went from living in an expensive apartment by myself to a much cheaper one and my partner moving in and splitting the costs.

Now my student loans. Currently in a program at work that will pay for my masters in full, and up front. Started taking courses and the school reported to the student loan servicers that I've returned to school, and that put all the loans under my name/my parents name into deferment. This was done just in the past week.

SL total: $93,305. Interest accrued today sits at: $240

Loan 1, My loan:

* Principal: $21,857.37

* IR: 4.41%

* OI: $29.61

* Payment due before deferment: $293

Loan 2, PPL:

* Principal: $370

* IR: 7.90%

* OI: $0

* Payment due before deferment: $0. Wasn't in repayment yet, but I've been throwing money since January to get it down from 4.5K at the highest interest rate.

Loan 3, PPL:

* Principal: $26,739.38

* IR: 6.410%

* OI: $116.74

* Payment due before deferment: $205.14 

Loan 4, PPL:

* Principal: $25,778.06

* IR: 7.210%

* OI: $55.97

* Payment due before deferment: $208.03

Loan 5, PPL:

* Principal: $18,561.09

* IR: 6.840%

* OI: $38.24

* Payment due before deferment: $147.54 

The original plan to tackle these loans was to pay the mandatory minimum payment due for each one which amounts to around $855. Then pay an additional $855 or more into the loan with the highest interest rate to pay them down faster.

But now that deferment has essentially removed any minimum payment due until my courses are complete, what's stopping me from throwing $855+$855+whatever remains after expenses/some savings into the highest interest loan and get rid of it as fast as possible? 

I'm reading up on capitalized interest and I'm not really sure the downside to it. Is it that once the deferment has ended, all the interest gets added to the principal and I'll end up paying interest on my accrued interest? Since the PPLs are in my father's name, he makes well over 85K so there are no tax benefits to paying off interest as they go to his name. Is the solution to this to instead pay the accrued interest each month at a minimum and then throw the remainder of the minimum $1710 into the highest interest loan?

Or is my best solution what I was doing before, removing deferment, making all the minimum payments due (all the interest + whatever is left) and throwing an additional minimum $855 into my highest interest loan?

It's not the math of how much money I'd end up paying that confuses me, I'm wondering if there are downsides to deferment other than the capitalized interest that I haven't taken into account. Would appreciate any help or guidance as I don't have many people to talk to about this. Thanks so much.",finance
personalfinance,TSP return calculation,"Hi All,

I just go a job with the Department of Veteran's affairs this past April. The Agency mandates employees contribute 3% to TSP, They'll match up to 5%, but they also give 1% as well. 

At orientation I signed papers to increase my contribution up to the 5% matching max, but they lost it. So my first check they took 3% from my paycheck and contributed their 4% 

I was on SSDI prior to getting this job  and I will receive it for 9 months plus a 3 month grace period for a total of a year. (I thought it was only 8-9 months) and since I needed to fill out the contributions again to increase it I decided to up my contributions to $500/pay period- so I'm essentially banking about 40% my paycheck a GS-4 making 30k, and living off SSDI for the time being. When it gets close to SSDI going away I'm going to drop my TSP contribution to 5% 

My page shows Employee contributions of 34.42, (got a 1.9% COLA for 2018 in 2nd paycheck) so $35.58 for paycheck 2. Then Employee contribution of $500 for paycheck 3. 

""Account balance by contribution""says I've contributed $563.25 with agency matching"" of $114.35 and their 1% contribution of 
$34.27 

but the ""Contributions summary"" page says I've contributed $568.80 with ""agency matching"" of $116.33 and their 1% contribution of $34.89. Is this adding in growth since April 1? 

This means with growth and Fed contributions my 568.80 has returned $151.22 which is 26% since April 1 (Yes I'm aware that the Feds are adding 6% but that's still a 20% gain in 6 weeks) That seems crazy, is my math wrong?",finance

personalfinance,Parent PLUS Loan with PSLF not working out due to too-high ICR plan,"So here we go- My mom is struggling to understand/deal with Parent PLUS repayment with PSLF &amp; I've practically paid off my loans. I need to help her immediately.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR:** Mom started process to get PSLF (consolidated &amp; granted ICR plan), went into forbearance twice &amp; has paid nothing for PSLF because her given ICR is too high for her to actually pay. Even if she did pay this ICR for 10 years, her loan will be practically paid off &amp; there will be nothing to really forgive anyways. I want to refinance this in either one of our names to get the lowest interest rate possible &amp; then work together to pay off ASAP. However, my formerly-salaried income is now project-based (but still guaranteed consistent) &amp; I don't know what to claim my income as when shopping refinancing rates in my name.

&amp;#x200B;

**The whole backstory:** I will be paying off the last bit of my $16,000 student loan debt in the next week or 2 &amp; would now like to put my focus towards my mom's Parent PLUS loans she took out for me. I graduated May 2017.

**My Navient sub/unsub loans:**

$16,250 total- fixed interest rates between 3.510-4.660%.

$2,500 left that I will pay off in the next week or 2.

Never consolidated/refinanced/entered forbearance, just obsessively gave any dollar I had to Navient to get this over with asap

&amp;#x200B;

**My mom's FedLoan Parent PLUS loan:**

\~$81,000 principal, \~1,000 interest- 6.75% interest rate

Entire $82,000 amount still needed to be paid, currently in 2nd forbearance. She has not paid anything since consolidating

She works for the government &amp; she proceeded with PSLF rules, but it's now clear to me she really didn't know what she was doing &amp; she just realized she is getting screwed by her ICR amount. This was what she did: Consolidated Nov 2018 (I graduated May 2017, says she made some payments under the initial loan servicers but I have no idea how much), requested/approved forbearance immediately Nov 2018, requested/accepted forbearance again Feb 2019, requested/approved ICR April 2019. Her first payment under ICR will be made June 2019 &amp; this will be her first payment after consolidation. She did not pay any interest from the forbearance &amp; it all capitalized.

&amp;#x200B;

**So the problem:** Her loan servicers have her under the ICR plan with a monthly payment of $845, which she has continually said is too high for her to possibly make each month. She says she makes $60,000 but I don't know her actual discretionary income. Plus, I've roughly used a loan payoff calculator for this $845, &amp; even if she did pay this ICR amount (which automatically raises every year, next would be $925), she will have basically already ***paid off*** her loans with major \~$30,000 interest by the time she can apply for Public Service Loan Forgiveness anyways. When I told her this, she said that she had called her loan servicers and the woman on the phone basically told her this same thing, that such a meaningless amount was going to be forgiven.

&amp;#x200B;

**What I think we need to do:** Forget trying for the PSLF because I don't believe it's the best way for her or I to save money on these loans. Plus, with how I've seen her go about trying to get the PSLF started I fear she will miss payments toward the 120 &amp; just overall will get screwed in the end by not having submitted some form or something. I think the best thing we should do now is try to refinance in either her name or refinance the loan to me in my name now, based on whoever can get the lower interest rate &amp; from there we both split the monthly payment as needed, paying together but under whoever's name ends up with it. My mom is adamant that she wants to pay this off asap as I did with my loans &amp; she does not want this loan in my name because she does not want that burden on me, however I want this loan gone &amp; I think if the difference in interest rate between us is significant, I have no problem taking it on on paper.

&amp;#x200B;

***I just think it would be better to refinance for as low as possible &amp; then bust our asses together to pay it off asap, rather than struggling each month to pay her ICR plan for 10 years &amp; hoping for the best to benefit us with PSLF. She will pay $30,000 of interest under her ICR for PSLF, but with refinancing we could potentially save $15,000 of interest over the same 10 year time.***

&amp;#x200B;

**The 2nd issue:** I don't know how to go about getting estimates for a refinance in my name, due to my differing income. I have a steady career &amp; was employed for a company with full benefits until recently when I took on a different project within the company &amp; am no longer technically an employee of that company for the next few months while I do this separate project. So while my income was $45,000 in January, I am now not salaried &amp; am paid $1,500 weekly &amp; this will continue for at least the next 25 weeks, to which I will then return as a salaried employee with benefits, likely at my $45,000. Because of this switch, I just don't know what to tell the refinancers what my income number is? Do I just say $45,000, or do I calculate how much I will make from my $45,000 &amp; then add all my weeks at $1,500? This is an unusual circumstance for me, &amp; let's assume it won't happen in any other years.

&amp;#x200B;

**Questions:**

* Can we even refinance the loan at this point &amp; stop moving forward with the PSLF even though she has already consolidated the loan, had 2 forbearances, &amp; was granted an IDR plan (the Income-Contingent Repayment Plan one)?
* Do you believe getting off the consolidated plan for PSLF is the best thing to do since she can't pay her monthly ICR (Income-Contingent Repayment plan amount)?
* Why do you think her ICR is too high for her to pay? Is it being based off an incorrect number somewhere? From what I see online an ICR plan should only be up to 20% of her discretionary income, so to me if this number *is* correct, she should be able to pay it, though she has continually said it is impossible for her to pay.
* Why would her PSLF even set her up to have her pay an extra $30,000 interest &amp; virtually nothing forgiven? I feel like her ICR numbers are wrong somewhere, but is it just a case of it being common that PSLF if going to screw over people?

personalfinance,1000/ month saving - how to handle,"Hi, 

I read the wiki but couldn't find any specific advice for my situation.

I'm 24, female and will be able to save 1000 dollars a month for at least the next year. Next year I will start graduate school which will cost me about 8k per year (I will be going part time for four years). I will be getting 17k (spaced out over the 4 years) from my parents to help with the graduate school expenses (34k). Should I just save the 1k per month in a normal account or would it be wiser to invest it and pay graduate school with the 17k my parents are calculating with and take out a loan (2% interest rate) for the other half of graduate school expenses? 


I don't have an emergency fund but as my parent's would be able to loan me money in an emergency I don't see the need for one atm. 

Thankfull for any ideas!",finance
personalfinance,Did I make a bad car buying/financial decision?,"So I bought a used 2016 V6 Dodge Challenger back in October of 2017 that is currently worth $17,500 and gets 18 MPG. Recently, my driving habits have changed because I work part-time for a food delivery service (Waitr), and now drive over  1,600 miles a month, which could potentially be close to 20,000 miles a year. My payoff amount for my loan on the Challenger was $24,000, which means I would be rolling over close to $7,000 on the purchase of a new car.

&amp;#x200B;

I decided that I wanted to look at a new 2019 Honda Civic which gets around 30MPG, for $20,000. My new loan amount would go from $24,000 to $27,000(not including interest), but I would be saving about $120 dollars in gas a month and $40 a month on insurance, and my monthly car payment would stay the same($450). So in my mind, I would be saving close to $2000 a year on gas and insurance, which I could save for other expenses or pay down my debts faster.  I would basically recoup the $3000 that rolled over to my new loan in about 1 and a half years, and if I decided to run the Honda into the ground, I would continue to save money on gas 5-10 years down the line, which I could more quickly pay the debt and hopefully decrease my interest as low as possible. I ultimately decided to make the trade but a part of me regrets it because I might get killed on the interest rate if I'm not able to refinance at some point. Another factor that I weighed on was that the cost of repairs for the Honda would be a lot less than than the Dodge, as Dodge is less reliable when they start to hit the 100K mile mark. Did I make a bad financial decision or do you think I will reap benefits in the long term?",finance

personalfinance,1 month job in the film biz nets 10k instead of my usual 2k. What should I do with the extra money?,"I work in the film business. After taxes, my pay would usually come out to 600-700 a week. I have been a Production Assistant for 5 years and it is pretty exhausting, but I've been grinding away at it because my goal was to join the DGA (the Directors Guild of America) as an Assistant Director. Recently I just got my first job doing so, and the pay increased dramatically. Due to the gig nature of my line of work, there's no telling when my next AD job will be, but hopefully it will be soon.

In 4 weeks of working hours similar to what I was working as a Production Assistant, I netted about $10k. I already spent $2400 of this money paying down credit cards, but I wanted to check with you guys before I continue down this path.  I also sent my mom 1k for Mother's Day.  It's a tradition in my culture to send the first paycheck (in my case, I waited until I was making more than 1k a week), to one's parents.  I decided to split that and send my Mom and Dad 1k each for Mother's day and Father's day respectively.

**Here's my financial situation:**

Chase Freedom Visa Credit Card:

$2900 / $3700 with a 21.49% APR

Chase Slate Credit Card:

$3050 / $4200 with a 17.24% APR

Bank of America Credit Card:

$1200 / $2000 with a 0 Percent promotional APR until April 2020

Student Loan Debt:

$5000 left of student loan debt.  The website is down for maintenance at the moment, but the interest rate is low and I'm not worried about this debt immediately.

More Info: I just moved so I'm going to have about 1k in moving expenses all things considered.  I'm getting rid of some things and need a new bed, so I'm getting a cheap-ish 350 dollar Nod from Tuft + Needle.

So Here's where I'm at:

10,000 (net monthly gain)

\- 2400 (CC Payments)

\- 1000 (Moving expenses)

\- 2000 (Mom and Dad gifts)

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

4600 Remains.  Am I doing this right?

Oh, and here are my monthly expenses:

* 200 (Groceries - They feed us at work so I don't buy much)
* 700 (Rent)
* 150 (Utilities)
* 200 (Gas for my Car - Car is paid off)
* 130 (Cel Phone bill)
* 65 (Monthly Student Loan Payment)
* 50 (Subscription boxes)
* 20 (Streaming Services)
* 200-300 Misc purchases.  Clothes, alcohol, etc.

1750-1850

I suppose I should cut down on my monthly expenses.  My excuse for the little luxuries was always that I was working so much, being fed at work decreased my need to shop for food or eat at restaurants.  Also that being at work all the time decreased opportunities to spend money.

I am going back to being a Production Assistant for one movie next month, so I will be making enough to break even but not quite enough to pay down any more debt after the next job.  After that movie is done, there's a job in Los Angeles that is offering my 150K a Year (which feels too good to be true, but then again, so did this 10k windfall).  I don't want to bank on that offer because I don't consider it a sure thing until my deal is signed, but they'd be hiring me contractually for a full year and I'd know after my next film is complete.

CryptoCurrency,"The Legal BitConnect That Cannot Fail: The US Monetary Policy. And How Crypto Will Free The Masses From This Scam That Is Called ""Treasury Bonds""","# Treasury Bonds and Inflation: a Ponzi backed by Tax Payers

If you want to see how perverse the US monetary policy really is, look up treasury bonds. The idea is basically putting debt into an asset and selling it on the market with the promise of paying it back with interest. The US government is a giant Ponzi Scheme, a machinery that keeps financing itself through this cycle. It works because of inflation that allows the fed to pay interest.

Once you get behind the naive thought that all this debt is supposed to ever be paid back, you realize how fucked up this really is. The fed can keep accumulating an ever-growing debt forever. They don't effectively pay it back. It's a continues differential process, not an open balance sheet waiting for settlement.

Not only the fed bit also bond holders are making a massive profit because they are paid interest. And pure finance (that is not producing any actual goods) is a zero sum game: Every win to someone is a loss to  somebody else. So who is losing in this game? Basically everyone else. Treasury bonds are the official government version of BitConnect. More and more money is allocated into treasuries. Tax payers unknowingly provide the security cover to prevent the Ponzi from collapsing. Taxes are what gives treasury holders their confidence to loan the fed.

On top of that, the government is taking full advantage of it's power position right next to the money drain. They sit on oil. That oil is called inflation and it's actually less of a liquid and more of thin air they use to print money.

This Ponzi won't fail because its victims, average tax payers, don't know about how inflation is ultimately ripping them off while enriching the government and treasury holders.

# The Organized Cash Grab: Rule #0 of the Power Game

***Now here's a shower thought for you that should give you chills once you get to the core***\*: Those few smart people who do find out how this giant machinery works, are allowed to become part of that money grab by buying treasuries that gives them a profit above the inflation rate at the expense of the clueless masses.\*

***The unspoken rule #0 of this power game:*** *Once you find out the single purpose of all rules in this game is to make everybody else lose so that the winners can win by playing against these very rules, there is no reason to call the winners out for cheating because now you are invited to play against the rules as well and ascend to a winner yourself.*

***This keeps the game going forever because everybody who realizes these dirty tricks, has no real reason to complain but can become a cheater to take profits themselves.***

# The Role of Crypto

Crypto is giving the sovereignty over this game back to the people. It is enforcing a monetary policy where no central entity in power can inflate the supply. Crypto is not taking loans, it is not handing out treasury bonds and most importantly it is not selling its community to the few individuals that can see behind the curtain of a machinery that is kept just abstract enough to prevent the masses from seeing through it.

personalfinance,Give me investment options/ideas,"Also posting this on r/investing but thought I would also post here for more opinions.

&amp;#x200B;

Little info about myself and my current financial situation:

Currently a 23 y/o Air Force Officer stationed in Florida with 2 months in service.  My yearly salary is roughly 65k and I am pretty efficient at saving since I have a good roomate that I split rent with as well as carpool to work with.  After all expenses have been paid or accounted for(rent, insurance, food, leisure, etc)/federal tax money taken out/and 20% of my base pay going towards a TSP, I currently have about $1400 a month in extra savings that I am wondering how I should invest it in.

I currently have 2k in a checkings account, 5k in a HYS account, and no debt or student loans.

I was wondering what you all think would be a good way to get decent return on it? I am open to low-medium risk investment ideas. I have been toying with the idea of getting a financial advisor/roboadvisor but haven't yet since I am not sure what they charge for fees and if $1400 a month is even enough for that. I have also been thinking about maybe putting it into a good 6-10% return mutual fund.",finance
personalfinance,Mother passed away - my plan for the inheritance,"I am recently going to come into a large sum of money due to my mum passing away recently and I am wondering what would be the best way to go about things. SOrry about the formatting and everything this is my first time posting on Reddit. Some background first; this is all based in Victoria, Australia and I have 1 sister whom I will be sharing everything with and the will states to split everything 50/50. So, lets begin:

  
I have about 50K in savings, make 50K per year and have no debt. My girlfriend and I live together and are paying $280/wk for rent and we split all expenses 50/50. We are planning to buy our own house to live in the next few years. We don't mind delaying this process by 1-3yrs but don't want to rent much longer than that. I have done some quick calculations and think this would work out but I believe I am missing some key details which I hope you all can help me with.   
My mum had 2 houses, House A) is brand new and worth \~500K and another old run down house worth \~200K (probably more though) she also had about 60K in savings, super and assets.

I have only just recently thought about buying House A as an investment property (I do not want to live there due that being the place mum passed away in) and rent it out:  
Since I technically own half of House A, I should only need a loan of 250K to buy my sister out of her share. I believe with the savings I currently have I should be able to get this loan and have mortgage repayments around $270-310/wk depending on the interest rate (going for a typically 30 yr loan, just to keep repayments low but would be making extra payments). The area House A is in, I would be able to easily rent it out for $400/wk. I believe I would be able to pay it off within \~10 years just by putting the rent money straight into the repayments and being a new house it won't need ongoing repairs.

Then in about a years time when we are finally able to sell House B and divide the other assets of my mums, my half would be \~130K. I would then use this 130K to put down a down payment on a house for my girlfriend and I to move into.  So we would be working to pay off that new house and the investment property would be paying itself off.

&amp;#x200B;

What I am concern about it, is that this all seems to be too good to be true. Essentially I could own 2 properties within the next 2-4 years. With one of them being self-sustaining. I am just wondering if I have missed anything? Like taxes, i.e. do I get taxed on the large sum of money that I will inherit from mum's will? Would I have to pay capital gains tax for the House A or is it just transferring the name of the property to me?

&amp;#x200B;

I hope that all makes sense, please free feel to ask any questions if it doesnt make sense.

personalfinance,My husband lent over 65K using credit cards to a friend's business and hid it from me.,"My husband (M36) lent 65K using credit cards to a friend's business and hid it from me for two years. I (F41) found out when he wrote the debt down in a workbook we were using for a personal finance course. At first my husband kept insisting that the debt was going to be repaid. However as a former banker, I could see it was a bed debt based on answers to my questions:

* What business was his friend doing (vague businesses, selling expensive niche perfume and real estate)
* Had he shared a business plan with my husband? (No he had not)
* Did they have a contract? (His friend signed IOUs)
* Was the interest rate reasonable? (An exorbitant 50% interest rate)
* Had any money been repaid? (Many times his friend had defaulted and instead of paying asked to borrow even more money.)

After arguing with my husband and not convincing him to call the loan in, I called both our parents and let them know. They both agreed with me that this was a bad loan, a foolish idea, and not likely to be repaid. I also told our pastors and they sat with us and counselled us, and let my husband know that the best solution is to start repaying the debt as quickly as possible.

After many arguments and me being bitter, hurt and angry, we somewhat settled. Our parents gifted us cash to help reduce the loan and clear his credit cards, and he got a second job to pay them back.

His parents joined us to read the 21 IOUs his friend signed promising to pay back the loan. They also had a conference with my husband's friend's parents (my husband and his friend are childhood friends. His friend's parents confirmed the loan and said their son is adamant that he will repay. However 5 months have passed since I discovered the loan and no additional money paid back. $6K paid back so far over the 2 years the money was being lent out.)

So to sum it up, with the help of our parents, the debt was reduced to 40k, the credit cards have now been closed, and my husband is repaying the sum advanced by his parents. He took a second job to help pay off the debt, which is now 28k.

He has promised to never do this again, however I am not sure if I should trust him again. I am taking the following steps to safeguard myself:

1. Leaving majority of my assets to my children in my will and also my life insurance. Because I cannot trust him to make financially sound decisions.
2. Checking his accounts via [personalcapital.com](https://personalcapital.com/) every month.
3. Looking at the budget we have on a monthly basis and tracking our spending.
4. Checking his credit on [annualcreditreport.com](https://annualcreditreport.com/)
5. I am concerned that his dad says my husband should put the money he has saved so far to repay the 40k loan in a savings account. His dad won't take the repayment unless my husband's friend pays back. I would like the debt repaid as quickly as possible and I don't have faith in my husband's friend repaying the sums. Therefore I am thinking of having access to the money saved up to pay his dad, so I can see it and know it isn't touched. We could also put the money in a fixed deposit.

I live in Washington State, and my kids are 11,4 and 2. Top priorities now are growing wealth, retirement savings and college savings for the kids.

I have some money saved up for retirement, a little money in the kids college funds (not enough though, and a good job that earns enough to  pay half the expenses of the home (which I do), and continue to save for my retirement.)

I would like to know if there are any other steps I could be taking to safeguard wealth and my children's financial future.

Please point out any flaws in my education plan.","I will be attending Clemson University (#23 rated public school in the country) and majoring in Accounting or finance. I come from a poor household but I have learned from their mistakes. I did 1.5 years at CC and stayed debt free. My goal is to get my bachelors with only $20k-30k max in federal loans. I was able to save $23k over 2 years but paid $5k for my first car and spent $3k on school, so I’m left with $15k as of right now. Ideally I’d like to keep $5k as an emergency fund, leaving me with $10k of disposable money for this year. I will be living off campus at Clemson, which is roughly 4 hours from home (in-state). Tuition and fees will be roughly $16.5k per year. Rent+ utilities will be roughly $500/month. My mom will be able to help with half my rent/utilities as well as car insurance. So far I have qualified for pell grant and Stafford loan worth roughly 12k per year combined. This leaves me having to come up with about $5k out of pocket per year for tuition. I should hopefully be left with enough to cover this first year. I will obviously have to continue working through college. I will be applying for scholarships and grants until I leave for school but those aren’t guaranteed. Parent plus loans are not an option and I refuse to take out private loans under any circumstance. I have estimated my living expenses to be as followed for the 10 months I’m at school: 

Rent+utilities- $250/month
Groceries- $320/month
Gas- $160/month
Car fund/maintenance(preventative)- $100/month
Dog food and vet bills- $100/month

personalfinance,40-yr experiment: 401(k) vs taxed contributions w/ compounding interest,"Help me please. I'm reading opinions about 401(k)s. Some say unless you get an employee match, it's no better than a personally-managed brokerage account, and probably worse. Some say it's a necessary vehicle to retire. 

  
I'd like help on how I think about taking withdrawals from a 401(k) at retirement age and the compounded earning potential of deferred-tax earnings. Especially my assumptions.

&amp;#x200B;

Compare 401(k) account balance to taxed-contribution account balance in 40 years...

&amp;#x200B;

Assume total average income tax rate over 40 years is 30%. Assume no company match. Assume no increased contribution limit. Ignore inflation. 7% interest rate. Assume I only invest in the same S&amp;P 500 index fund with the 401(k) and post-tax account. Assume max contribution of $19,000 (I do this now).

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

a) Tax (@30%) $19,000 and you get $13,300 \* 40 years = $532,000 principal. 

Apply moderate average compounding at 7% annual w/ $1,108 semi monthly payments over 40 years = **$2,908,000**

**Total Interest earned: $2,376,000**

Growth: Ending Balance/Principal = 2,908,000/532,000 = 5.466165

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

b) Deferred tax $19,000 and you get $19,000 \* 40 years = $760,000 principal.

Apply moderate average compounding at 7% annual w/ $1,583 semi monthly payments over 40 years = **$4,155,000**

**Total Interest earned: $3,395,000**

Growth: Ending Balance/Principal = 4,155,000/760,000 = 5.467105

&amp;#x200B;

Growth was the same, yes. BUT! Now I have over $1,000,000 extra because I let pre-tax dollars grow. That's leverage.

&amp;#x200B;

**Aren't you better letting tax-deferred money grow with compounding interest?** Yes you'll have to pay (higher?) taxes when it's time to withdrawal for retirement, but again, I'll have A MILLION MORE DOLLARS. Fine. Tax that million. **I'll still have more $$$$ after taxes, right?**

&amp;#x200B;

Now add in that sweet employee match and that gap widens. A lot. Fine, tax those gains too. 

&amp;#x200B;

And then  reinvest that huge remaining chunk to further widen the gap?

&amp;#x200B;

Wouldn't you rather pay higher tax on the higher earnings than lower tax on the lower earnings?

&amp;#x200B;

It seems to me that you'll simply have more money no matter what (in this vacuum scenario) because tax-deferred principal was larger than taxed principal. 

&amp;#x200B;

Am I missing something? This seems like a no brainer to me. Therefore, I must be missing something.

Thanks for the help.",finance

financialindependence,Wealth Building Tips &amp; Tricks,"This post is tips &amp; tricks on how to increase your wealth. Extra tips commented here will be added to the list and a more comprehensive post will follow later on. 

It is more about the obscure tips that not many people will know but can make a big difference. The target audience is people who frequent this and other related subs and already know the basics. For example I won’t add things like ‘budget’ and ‘invest early for compounding’ as this is basic advice. I’m no expert and this is only what I know from my limited knowledge but I hope it can help. 

Here is the list so far:

1. Swap jobs every 2 years: Unless your job has great career opportunities, in which case ask for raises of at least 2% per year to offset inflation, or 2%+ for a ‘real’ increase. 

a. A more tactful approach here would be to ask for raises at periodic years that equate for 2% per year, as asking for a raise every year could annoy the employer. For example asking for a raise of 6% every 3 years sounds better than asking for a raise of 2% every year for 3 years in a row.

b. Ask for these raises after lunch on a Friday: It has been scientifically proven that you are more likely to get what you want when the other person is happy (Friday) and not hungry (after lunch). There are many other psychological methods you can use, e.g. Benjamin Franklin Effect. Too many to list all of them. 

2. Write a book on how to do your job: The important thing here is not the sales of the book, but rather the increase in salary that saying you are an author will get you. An added benefit is speaking and networking opportunities to boost yourself further. You overall become more ‘validated’ in your field of work. 

3. Build your credit score: This is becoming more important as employers are beginning to check FICO score, not just mortgage lenders anymore. Added benefit of lower interest rates and therefore saving money. 

4. Improve your tax efficiency: Seeing a tax expert will save more money than any other professional advice in most situations. Most of the time a CFA etc. can’t do anything more than you are already able to do however tax advisors can knock large percentages off. 

5. Buy quality over quantity: Where appropriate (if you are using the item a lot) it is usually better to buy expensive, high quality items than cheap, low quality items in the long run. See: r/BuyItForLife

6. When buying a car, research its depreciation curve: Cars have very predictable depreciation curves which can save a lot of money (or sometimes make money) when it comes to reselling.

7. When trading, negotiate with brokers: A lot of the time you can get very large discounts on trading fees, all you have to do is ask. 

8. If starting a business, set up a redirector from your nearest big city for your phone number and business address to look more professional. For example if I started a business in California, I can set my business address to LA to increase its professionalism and ‘validity’. There are dedicated companies that offer this service for cheap and it works anywhere in the world. (Works better for business cities such as London \[I’m from UK\] and New York). It can give your business that slight advantage over others that could make the difference. 

9. If you are setting up an online company or doing any online business at all, Search Engine Optimisation (SEO) is a top priority for you. Doing this will increase your internet traffic and needs to be done if you’re ever going to be seen online. 

I hope this helps at least one person, if anyone has other tips to add please comment them and I will add them for a bigger and more comprehensive post in the future. I am posting this on both r/personalfinance and r/financialindependence to get as much return as I can. It can be about anything as long as it increases your wealth. This includes, increasing income, running a business, investing, saving, psychology of getting what you want, worthwhile side hustles (notice ‘worthwhile’ e.g. not surveys) and anything else. 

Again, this is for tips that are not obvious (e.g. Budget) and not trivial (e.g. recycling, which is very important but not going to make you much richer!). Thanks.",finance
computers,Requesting Assistance for the Purchase of a Video Card,"Greetings, I'll try to be brief.   


Basically, I don't know shit when it comes to choosing parts for a desktop. The extent of my knowledge for the hardware is how to take it apart and put it back together, but when it comes to part compatibility I really am unsure.   


I purchased a pre-built computer some time ago, for obvious reasons but as well because my budget was low and I just wanted something that would do the job and it has. *I will link the computer specs below.*  


The computer was intended for general use and mainly playing the game World of Warcraft. After getting fed up with Blizzard about six months ago I stopped playing, but a friend had convinced me to give ESO, or Elder Scrolls Online, a try despite my adamant attitude toward investing any of my time in any other MMO. Naturally I fell in love with the game and I spend enough time playing ESO that FPS decline has become noticeably a factor in my individual performance in the game and I would like to have a steady and consistent performance when playing to game to enjoy my time more. With my current computer, the game is playable in every situation, maintaining as high as 60 FPS, but during hectic moments where a lot of particles and textures, addons using memory etc are present my frames may get as low as 10-11 per second and I am rather fed up with it, especially when it can be resolved.  


So here I am, I don't know shit about video cards, and I need someone's help in purchasing one, possibly a brief explanation in how to install them as well. As my computer currently uses an on-board graphics system, I'm not sure if that changes the installation of a video card - I know how to screw it in and get it physically connected, but if there are any extra steps when making this conversion I would really appreciate the know-how.

I would much rather go lower on a video card that will be sufficient and do the job with my settings essentially all on *minimum.*

I would like to get as low as possible on the price, without sacrificing too much on the product that is needed, but my budget is up to $500 comfortably.

btc,My Biggest Regret,"To get a general overview of why I switched to BCH, read here: https://pokkst.xyz/bch

My biggest regret however, is spending several years working on BTC developing various apps for that chain. I kept going though, hoping one day that maybe... just maybe they'd *actually* increase the block size limit (even if just a tiny bit).

A sunk cost fallacy, if you will. I regret waiting, and waiting. I regret waiting for the Lightning Network to be polished. Waiting for something to happen where it would just get better. 

""Just use Segwit"" people would say. Using Segwit didn't help the fee situation literally at all. I was still paying so much money for every transaction. I'm a broke college student, so the fees for every transaction added up and I would lose money quickly when trying to by anything with BTC. 

""Just use Lightning Network"" they would then say. So I'd have to still pay exceptionally high fees just to get my coins onto the Lightning Network. Then when using a non-custodial wallet for the Lightning Network it was such a pain in the fucking ass that it was just too much of a burden. I even used a custodial solution for a bit, but even then that was still a pain in the ass. Payments wouldn't route, so I'd have to try several fucking times to get my coins to go anywhere. The UX is broken on a core level. No cold storage for the Lightning Network either.

""Just use a credit card"" they said. So what's the point of BTC then? You want me to ""hodl"" my coins, but when I want to spend them, I'm supposed to use Segwit, then the Lightning Network. I'd lose vast amounts of money trying to open channels, only to find out that barely anything accepts Lightning Network payments.

I kept seeing the same chants over-and-over. ""hodl"", ""it's a store-of-value"", ""use a credit card"", ""why would you spend your btc?""

For several months into 2019, I grew fed up with the bullshit. I wanted out of this ""cult"". I had several friends from the BTC camp, and a few in the BCH camp. In private I talked to them about my dilemma. Eventually I made the tweet announcing my move to BCH, with the article linked (the same one I linked above).

I've been much happier. Everyone here is much nicer. There's no ""hodl"" memes and chants, no ""store-of-value"" chants, no ""use a credit card"" bullshit. I lost several friends after I announced my switch. I was attacked (and I still am attacked by various people, but I'm not going to name them), reported, and blocked by various people and some of them I considered close friends. There are a few who stayed by my side, and those are the ones I cherish.

I want to say thank you to this community for being so welcoming. I mostly wrote this as a reflection/post-mortem as just recently marked two months since the announcement/switch.

business,Need Reporter,"I run a small internet retail business. In the beginning of April my product went viral on Reddit and I got over 100k visitors to my site and my product quickly sold out. While I was waiting for more inventory to arrive a slew of Chinese counterfeiters cloned my website, stole my product photos and starting selling goods that resembled mine on very similar domain names. Most of these sellers took weeks and months to ship their product, and when they did it was completely inferior to mine. Obviously these customers got upset and mistakingly began sending angry emails MY website and Facebook demanding their product or a refund because the product looked nothing like the photos.

I graduated from a state college with a computer science degree and no debt. My tuition was covered by a scholarship. For housing/books, I worked part time as a TA and tutor to make some money on the side and my parents also pitched in an amount. (graduated in 3 years which also helped on the cost, ty AP classes)

Moved to the west coast (seattle) after college for first job at a large tech company. Starting salary was $110k/year + $40k stock/4 years + 30k signing bonus.
As soon as I could, I bought a 2 bedroom condo in seattle because the housing market was booming and I thought it would be a good investment. I super messed up here and got a 15 year mortgage instead of 30 year because the interest rate was lower and I didn't know any better at the time.

About a year and a half into the job, I got laid off in a big company cut. This was a pretty stressful time since I had such a big liability. I was able to land a new job in a month and a half which meant I actually made money on the severance package.

The new job was in SFO area for one of the FAANG. New comp = $150k/year + $300k stock/4years + 50k signing bonus. This move also included a promotion. I was able to negotiate my salary for this position really well because I had a lot of different offers that gave me leverage. At the time, I had offers from Microsoft, Amazon, Facebook, Google, and multiple startups. It's crazy how much leverage you have when you are in that kind of situation. 

Now, I rent out my seattle condo. It doesn't cash flow at all, but it has appreciated like crazy since I got it. The condo accounts for about half my net worth.

Asset alloc  
rental property - 210k - (value) 400k - (principal) 190k  
401k - 70k  
company RSUs - 70k  
ira - 13k  
hsa - 8k  
checking account - 60k  
SP500 - 8.5k  
VEA - 1.8k  (developed markets etf)
VWO - 1.8k  (emerging markets etf)
VTI - 8.6k  (total market etf)
Actively invested - 18.4k (mostly google, amazon, fb, apple)  

total NW - 470k  

One thing to note is that I am holding extra cash in my checking account on purpose right now because my property is actually vacant after my tenant broke the lease. He's still on the hook for rent until I find a new tenant, but I'm having trouble with replacing him right now. The cash is just for extra security.

In terms of FI progress, I'm targeting 1.5M as my goal. I probably won't retire, but rather quit the corporate job and go into startups.

Obviously, I've had quite a bit of luck so far. I'm interested in any questions or comments people might have.

edit: I've realized this post comes off like a humble brag, but its fine, take from it what you will.",finance
personalfinance,Might be getting a chunk of money now. Wondering whether I should pay down my mortgage or invest?,"Hey all,

My grandma passed away recently and I might be coming into an inheritance. I was just wondering whether financially it would be better for me to pay down my mortgage (interest rate of 2.95%) or invest it into index funds? I am not sure which would make the most sense. I can pay down a chunk of my mortgage in September without incurring any fees and all the money goes to the principal.

business,Getting a small business loan without security in Mumbai,"It is an exciting time to be an entrepreneur. Why? Indian banks, [**new-age financial institutions**](https://www.tribe3.com/?utm_source=reddit) and NBFCs are making it easier to get [**quick business loans**](https://www.tribe3.com/business-loan-products?utm_source=reddit). Typically, there are two types of [**business loans in India**](https://www.tribe3.com/business-loan-products?utm_source=reddit) available for a small business owner– secured and unsecured business loans. There will be occasions when a business owner wants a loan without security. Unsecured business loans or loans without security do not require any collateral – as they tend to be smaller. If you want to [**apply for a business loan**](https://www.tribe3.com/apply-for-business-loan-online?utm_source=reddit) in Mumbai, here are some things you should know.

Factors that influence an [**unsecured business loan**](https://www.tribe3.com/business-loan-products?utm_source=reddit) application:

Since finances are the backbone of any venture, financial institutions make it easy to get collateral free loans. Applicants usually are required to meet the following criteria, to get a [**business loan in Mumbai**](https://www.tribe3.com/business-loan-products?utm_source=reddit):

* The applicant must be between 23 -65 years old
* The business should have been operational for a minimum of 1 year and tax returns should have been filed.
* The applicant must have a good credit score.
* The applicant must have a good business growth plan with revenue generation.
* The applicant must have chalked out a clear repayment plan

If the business meets the above conditions, the applicant needs to fill in an online business loan application form on the lending company’s website or mobile application. A loan officer will consider the above factors before disbursing the required funds. [**Collateral free loans**](https://www.tribe3.com/business-loan-products?utm_source=reddit) carry higher interest rates as the lender’s risk is higher. The term for an unsecured loan is also shorter.

Other factors, which influence the business loan process:

Stage: If you are a new business, it may be more difficult to get a loan from a bank and in such cases, private business loans are an option to consider.

If your business has been operating for 1 or more years, it is easier to get that loan as there is a performance track record that can be considered, before a loan is offered.

Product/service competitiveness: Lenders consider this aspect before they sign off on a business loan in Mumbai or any other location in India. If your company has been doing well in its niche or is on par with companies in a similar field, then unsecured loans are easier to come by.

Amount of business loan: The amount requested plays a big role in the sanctioning, especially in the case of collateral free loans. Modest amounts are easier to get if your company’s financials are strong. Before applying, you should run all the possible numbers and be very sure of your ability to repay.

Whom to approach: It is always easier to approach an institution you have done business with in the past. Talk to your [**digital lending company**](https://www.tribe3.com/?utm_source=reddit) or NBFC about getting a collateral free loan, as he/she is familiar with your business and its operations. Having a good credit score and a solid repayment history will facilitate getting business capital loans, when you need them most.

Essential tips to note:

* Find out more about the terms and conditions for unsecured business loans being offered by different institutions.
* Eligibility criteria can vary for each institution, as well as the formalities required for easy small business loans.
* Keep in mind that you will have to pay higher [**interest rates for unsecured business loans**](https://www.tribe3.com/apply-for-business-loan-online?utm_source=reddit) as compared to secured business loans.
* Your credit scores (CIBIL) must be good to get a collateral free business loan.
* There will be a service charge levied to get a loan.
* Loan limits vary for each institution – so do your homework and apply only for the amount that you need.
* Loan processing usually takes 4 to 5 working days after the required documents have been submitted and reviewed by the lender.
* Loan pre-payment is a good idea – check out this option and the charges you will incur for early repayment of the loan.

Unsecured business loans are a great resource for the growth of a small business. While secured loans are essential to establish and keep a business running, [**short-term unsecured loans**](https://www.tribe3.com/business-loan-products?utm_source=reddit) play an important role.  These loans are critical as they help a business to tide over difficult times.",finance
personalfinance,Recovering from Debt After Husband's Addiction,"Hello,

My husband and I have fallen into debt while dealing with his addiction and trying to figure out the best way to get our finances back in order. 

Background: Hubby was struggling with Heroin for the past 2.5 years, I took out credit cards when absolutely needed to stay afloat. There have been a few events, including jail, that finally helped get him clean and clear minded enough to want to actually get in recovery. He is currently in Drug Court and cannot work for, most likely, the next 6 months due to their schedule for him. 

While going through this I made decisions that I knew were not correct financially but did what I needed to so we didn't lose our apartment/so we could eat/ etc. 

I budget at least once a week and at this point I can usually make the payments but if any unexpected expense occurs it throws off everything and takes a few months to get back on track creating late payments and hits to my credit. 

We paid a $10,000 Bail earlier this year on a payment plan as well. 

Debt and Monthly Payments:

S900 - Am Ex - Monthly Payment = $75 
Projected Pay Off = August 2020

$6200 - Discover - Monthly Payment $96 (on payment plan) 
Projected Pay Off = 5 years (this will change when amount paid changes)

$2500 - Wells Fargo - Monthly Payment $150
Projected Pay Off = December 2021

$11790 - Car Note - Monthly Payment = $465
Projected Pay Off = July 2021

$5410 - Bail - Monthly Payment = $524
Projected Pay Off = March 2020

$900 - Federal Loan (School debt) Monthly Payment = $50
Projected Pay off = November 2020

Total Per Month = 1350
Total Yearly Gross = 54,000 to 56,000

After the $1350, there is still all of our living expenses, food, car, maintenance for car, etc.. Those total around $1250 per month.

I am currently projecting everything with no second income because I don't know exactly when he will be able/allowed to work. Once he can work, it would start at an additional $500 extra per month by my estimation and go up to $2000 once he can start metal working again. 

In March of next year, the bail will be paid in full and then I can accelerate other payments which I projected would change the following:

- Fed Loan paid by April 2020 instead of November
- Am Ex paid by May 2020 instead of August
- Wells paid by October 2020 instead of December 2021
- Car Note paid by May 2021 instead of July 2021
- Discover paid by October 2021 instead of 2024


Aside from debt, we do not have rent currently because I did in the end let go of the apartment while he was in jail and we now split our time between our families homes. 

My current paychecks are biweekly and range from $1450 to $1600 after taxes and benefits. 

My credit score took a huge dive dealing with everything and is in the low 500's. 

Does anyone have any ideas as far as options? I am basically looking for breathing room until March of next year and then paying off everything as fast as possible while still being able to live without the stress of just scraping by and falling behind to meet the payments. 

I am not illiterate financially, have looked into debt consolidation but due to my credit score, believe that is not an option. 

Any ideas? Or am I just stuck until either March or we have a second income?

Thanks in advance for any thoughts!",finance

personalfinance,"Two brand spanking new Attending physicians, with student loan debt of 660K, debating whether to buy first home now or delay? Please Help us out Reddit!","I need some impartial advice guys. My fiance and I are about to finish training and move to Atlanta where the rent for a decent and safe 2bd/2br apartment is about $2300-2800 a month (yeah..that's alot, but keep in mind the apartment is very convenient to work, virtually eliminates Atlanta traffic issues and is in a very safe area).
He'll be renting this upcoming year while I finish fellowship training for one more year in another city. 

Our issue is when to buy our first house. I would like to buy something next year (2020) so we can move into it as soon as I finish my fellowship. To get a decent starter home in the area we want will cost 400-700K. We have about 660K in student loans with interest rates under 7% that we're planning to pay off within the next 3-5 years. He'll have a practice buy-in of 250K broken into 3 payments each year starting in 2021. I'll also have a practice buy-in of 200K starting in 2022 with 50K due initially then the other 150K to be taken out of my pay interest free over the next 3 years. He believes that we should rent for 2-3 years while we save for a 20% down payment. I want to use a physician loan to purchase a home with 0% down (I used one before to buy my house during residency and had no issues when buying or selling my home). My reasoning is that we'd spend over 25K a year each of those years on rent and our monthly mortgage/interest/taxes/insurance in our area would likely be 2.7-4.8K a month. We'll already be paying 3.5K a month in combined rent this upcoming year while he's making 250-300K as an attending and I'm making about 75K as a moonlighting fellow. We will gross over 700K once I start working in 2020 and would be paying $2500 in rent at that time. We're in our early 30s..very early. We plan to get married in the next year. No kids yet but plan to start a family in 3-5 yrs.



TLDR: We owe 660K in loans that we'd like to pay off in 3-5 years, will make 700K+, have upcoming practice buy-ins of 500K in 2-3 years that we'll pay off over 3 years. I want to buy a 400-600K house (2.7-4.8K monthly with no down payment), he wants to rent at 2.5-2.8K monthly for 2-3 years, and save for down payment, then buy. What makes more financial sense? Thanks!

Edit:  I'm thinking of decreasing house range to something more reasonable 400-600k Max limit. Thanks so much for the responses so far! Keep em coming! Also my monthly cost of owning calculation already includes mortgage interest/taxes/insurance in our area",finance
finance,"Please, Can We Put An End To The Laws Governing Sunday Trading?","This is a subject that boils my blood! In England and Wales, shops over 280 m2 can only open a maximum of six hours between 10 am and 6 pm on Sundays. This is the result of the 1994 Sunday Trading Act, which was at least a step ahead of the 1950s Shops Act, which banned Sunday Trading altogether. The restrictions are applied because of the concerns of a religious minority and to protect retailers from the obligation to work on Sunday, but I do not believe that either of the lobbies has a case.

**Preserve the Sabbath**

For starters, I find it odious that Christians can dictate to the rest of what we do with our time and our business. No one is forced to shop on a Sunday. If you want to preserve the Sabbath, you can simply decide not to shop. Why should a minority be able to impose its point of view on the rest of us? I can not imagine and I really do not understand why the government is so eager to appease the church. It is an anachronistic institution that exploits fear and guilt and most people have long abandoned it.

**multicultural**

We now live in a multicultural society in which many people are followers of religions for whom Sunday is not the Sabbath. I'm sure there would be an uproar if purchases were also limited on Fridays and Saturdays. It is high time that a largely secular society is not controlled by those with religious beliefs.

**Sunday workers**

I do not buy arguments about worker protection either. It's a simple question to deal with. It is enough to maintain the current regulation that retail workers can not be forced to work on Sundays. After all, unemployment is widespread and an army of students is trying to finance their studies. I imagine, then, that there would be plenty of people happy to take their time. I was working in a theme park that was naturally open on the weekends. A large number of full-time workers chose not to participate in the programs on Saturday, Sunday or both, but many students and retirees jumped at the opportunity to take their place. No one was forced to work on weekends and yet there was never a staffing problem and I do not think he would have one in the retail sector either.

**Unfair**

The laws in force are also rather unfair to department stores. If you have a small shop selling children's clothing or gifts, you can open as long as you want, but department stores can not. I know you might argue that it helps small stores, but it is not. Because department stores are closed outside authorized hours, people do not usually start shopping until they are open, so no one wins.

**Choices**

For many people, Sunday is the most convenient day for shopping or the only day they have and so it seems unfair that they have limited hours. It is also curious that the disappearance of the main street is constantly in mourning and yet we are happy to aggravate the situation by preventing people from shopping the day they are most likely to do so. The situation is only pushing more people to buy online and I am one of them. I work on Saturdays so I have to go shopping on Sundays, but I'm fed up with overcrowded stores and the effort of traveling when I have little time to get to my destination.

It's time to change. Religious groups will have to accept that those who are not of their religion are allowed to choose for themselves what they do with their weekends and I guess Sunday work will not be a problem. Please let 2014 be the year when common sense prevails.

tech,TikTok parent Bytedance is reportedly working on its own smartphone,"It’s been a busy couple of months for Bytedance, one of the world’s [most valuable startups](https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/26/chinas-bytedance-leapfrogs-uber-to-becomes-worlds-most-valuable-startup/) and the operator of globally popular video app TikTok. The Beijing-based company has continued to grow its list of apps to include the likes of work collaboration tool [Lark,](https://blog.larksuite.com/) an instant messenger called [Feiliao](https://techcrunch.com/?p=1829663&amp;preview=true) as well as a [music streaming app](https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/21/tiktok-bytedance-music-app/), and now it appears to be taking a bold step into the hardware realm.

Bytedance is planning to develop its own smartphone, the Financial Times [reported](https://www.ft.com/content/ea4a2be4-7dca-11e9-81d2-f785092ab560) (paywalled) citing two sources. A spokesperson from Bytedance declined to comment on the matter, but the rumor is hardly a surprise as smartphone pre-installs have long been a popular way for Chinese internet companies to ramp up user sizes.

There’s also urgency from Bytedance to carve out more user acquisition channels. After a few years of frantic growth, Bytedance failed to hit its revenue target for the first time last year amid slowing ad spending in China, according to a [report](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-01-15/bytedance-is-said-to-hit-lower-end-of-sales-goal-amid-slowdown) by Bloomberg.

Some of Bytedance’s predecessors include selfie app maker [Meitu,](https://crunchbase.com/organization/meitu) which builds smartphones pre-loaded with its suite of photo editors and recently [sold this segment to Xiaomi](https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/19/xiaomi-gobbles-up-selfie-phone-brand-meitu-as-revenue-jumps-49/) as the latter tries to capture more female users and newcomers, including Snow-owned camera app B612 and Bytedance’s Faceu, close on Meitu’s heels.

Others have taken a less asset-heavy approach in the early days of the Chinese internet. Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent — known collectively as the BAT for their supremacy in China’s tech world — all worked on their own [custom Android ROMs,](https://technode.com/2015/01/20/android-rom-trend-back-in-china-tencent-os-launch/) which come with extra features compared to a stock ROM pre-installed by a phone manufacturer.

Alibaba’s ambition also manifested in a [$590 million investment in Meizu](https://techcrunch.com/2015/02/08/alibaba-meizu/) in 2016 that saw the eommerce giant take up the challenge to develop a tailored operating system for the handset maker. More recently in March, WeChat owner Tencent [teamed up](https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/21/razer-tencent/) with gaming smartphone maker Razor on a number of initiatives that cover hardware.

[ByteDance, TikTok’s parent company, plans to launch a free music streaming app](https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/21/tiktok-bytedance-music-app/)

There were early clues to Bytedance’s smartphone endeavor. The company [confirmed](https://www.scmp.com/tech/apps-social/article/2183281/bytedance-company-behind-tiktok-video-app-looks-beyond) in January that it has acquired certain patents and some employees from phone maker Smartisan, although it said at the time the deal was done to “explore the education business.” That was a curious statement as Smartisan’s business has little to do with education. At the very least, the tie-up confers hardware development capability on the mobile internet upstart.

Indeed, a source told the Financial Times that Bytedance founder Zhang Yiming “has long dreamt of a phone with Bytedance apps pre-installed.” Nonetheless, this is tipped to be an uphill battle, at least in China where smartphone sales are [cooling](https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prAP44865419) and competition intensifies between entrenched players like Huawei, Vivo, Oppo, Xiaomi and Apple.

Bytedance has built a leg up away from home, thanks to its empire of mobile apps. The company is one of the few — and many would argue the first — Chinese internet startups that manage to gain a meaningful foothold globally. [TikTok](https://crunchbase.com/organization/tiktok) has consistently [topped the worldwide app ranking](https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/16/tiktok-tops-the-ios-app-store-in-q1-for-the-fifth-quarter-in-a-row/) in the last handful of months, though it’s also encountered a few stumbling blocks in some of its larger markets.

In the United States, the Federal Trade Commission [imposed a fined](https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/28/daily-crunch-tiktok-fine/) on TikTok for violating children’s privacy protection law. The government of India, which has driven much of TikTok’s [recent growth](https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/29/its-time-to-pay-serious-attention-to-tiktok/), also took issue with the app to temporarily [ban](https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/16/tiktok-india/) it on account of illegal content.

While the US market may be difficult to penetrate given Washington’s concerns around the security threat that Chinese companies may present, India is now crowded with Chinese brands. A research done by [Counterpoint](https://www.counterpointresearch.com/chinese-brands-capture-record-66-indian-smartphone-market-q1-2019/) found that in the first quarter, Chinese manufacturers led by Xiaomi controlled a whopping 66 percent of India’s smartphone market. That means Bytedance, alongside its potential ally Smartisan, is not only up against local rivals in India but also the familiar faces from its home market.

business,START YOUR COMPANY FOR LESS THAN $20,"May 26, 2019, Atlanta, Georgia — What’s crazy is if I would have said “Internet business” you may not have considered this as newsworthy. But an “Internet business” is an “Internet company,” which means that you can actually launch your own company for as low as $10. How? That’s simple. All that you need is $10 or $20 dollars on a bank debit or credit card, a cool name that you can brand, and an Internet connection. Then with a little time and creativity, you can actually launch your own business in minutes. This is how easily we tend to miss opportunities that are right at our fingertips.

You’ve thought of a “millennial” name for your website right?! By the way, this is also referred to as a domain name. You are 99% positive that what you would offer would go through the roof. So instead of continuing to procrastinate, go to GoDaddy.com or 1and1.com – 2 companies that I recommend for start-ups in the early phase of the business because of the low cost – and sign up for one of their basic web hosting plans. Typically, you are looking for a plan that offers (1) web hosting space – a place where you can build and showcase your website; (2) at least one domain name – the “www.dot.name” where people will locate your site; and (3) email addresses. Each one of these companies offers package deals starting between $9.99 and $12.99 for the first year. That’s right! That’s for the entire year.

If you have never developed a website, don’t freak out. Most web hosting companies, ISPs or CDNs, offer templates for FREE – a word that EVERYONE loves to hear. A template is simply a collection of pre-developed web pages that make website development as easy as writing a book report or term paper in Microsoft Word or Google Docs. In fact, by using the templates you can actually have an iteration of your business up and running in minutes. Once this is done, you have successfully launched your own Internet company. It’s just that easy!

Yes, there are other things that may be required in order to operate the business – i.e. incorporation, establishing a federal and/or state tax ID, business license, bank account, etc. But by simply taking a few minutes to purchase and set up your basic web hosting plan, you have taken your first major step towards launching your very own company, and it was done for the cost and in less time than it takes you to have lunch at Five Guys – an awesome burger place by the way.

Other web hosting companies to consider are iPage.com and BlueHost.com. Aside from that, there are probably billions to choose from. But if it is your objective to do this today, allow me to be the first to congratulate you, and to welcome you to the wonderful world of entrepreneurship.

business,Using debt as an advantage.,"Can anyone give a detailed explanation of how one may use debt as a advantage in order to gain profit? I have seen this books but I have never quite understood how it works. 

I know that you use the debt from the bank and use it as a capital to invest in housing or rental property for example to charge a higher interest rate /rent rate to cover the costs of repaying the debt as well as putting money in your pocket. 

How does this work specifically work financially, and does it actually work?",finance

The same day i learnt of his existence was the same day i learnt that he wants to leave everything in his will to my daughter cause he some how found out she has the same name as his mom.

personalfinance,Paying back loan asap or invest?,"Hi,

This is the first time I post here but I have been reading this sub for awhile. Me &amp; my family we got only 1 loan in our name (mortgage), but we also want to start investing for our future (kids, relocation if needed, rental property, etc). My question is: 

At the moment we have our interest rate at 1.5% &amp; the interest cap is 2.5% for the next few years. So we know for certain fact that the interest can’t rise higher than that. Before we used to save for the downpayment, so now after paying the bank, we have some extra every month. Should we invest the extra or should we pay back the loan ASAP? 

- If investing, what should we invest in? Downpayment for another property? Stocks? 

Thank you all for your comments &amp; advice.",finance
personalfinance,Just Got Married! Wife has about 100k (and growing) in student loans. Seeking advice!,"Howdy everyone!

&amp;#x200B;

I got married over the weekend and I wanted to get a jump on trying to figure out our financial future. Here is some background info.

&amp;#x200B;

I am currently a second year resident making \~58k a year. In about 4-5 more years, I'll be making physician level salary (200-300k). I was exceptionally lucky and ended up with nearly no student loan debts to deal with. My wife is half way (2/4) years through veterinary school. Through her education, she has now about 100k and growing worth of student loan debts (Federal, un-subsidized) . Her interest rate is about 6%. She currently has no income. Kids are in the future, but likely 3-4 years from now. We live in apartments at the moment and a house will not be considered until about 3-4 years as well. Aside from the loans, we aren't doing terribly. 

&amp;#x200B;

My questions revolve paying down her debts. Since I am making money now, should I start making some monthly payments on her principals while she is still in school? If so, should it be more minimal or bigger payments? Should we wait until she finishes and invest the money elsewhere until then? I asked her about loan forgiveness, and she says that there isn't many options aside from government work. Thank you all for reading! Also, we live in Texas if it matters.",finance

investing,Lump Sum or Dollar Cost Averaging in 2019,"Hello All, 

I've recently taken voluntary redundancy and as a result, received a redundancy package. I currently have a S&amp;S ISA, predominantly made up of index funds (looking to simplify), and a 80/20 Equity/Bond split, in addition to this I also have a cash ISA, which I'd like to invest. I have an emergency fund of 6 months, put aside in a low interest rate savings account. 

&amp;#x200B;

To simplify my portfolio, I'm likely to invest in Vanguard Global Cap (Acc)  (I was going for the LS80 however, with Brexit etc don't necessarily want the UK bias) and Vanguard Global Bond Index Fund, looking to retain 80/20 split. 

&amp;#x200B;

Given the markets are at an all time high, with some indications that this could turn in the next year, but no guarantee (I understand you can't time the markets, and this bull run could continue), I have a couple of questions:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Should I invest a lump sum, as time out the market, means I could miss the best days? Or is it logical to dollar cost average? (I've seen an article from Vanguard stating there's little difference, and even lump sum may do better) 
2. Linked to the above, if I did lump sum invest, is it logical to have an 'opportunity fund' also perhaps, held in cash ISA, to take advantage and invest in the case of a market correction/recession? Where do you keep your opportunity fund, if you have one? 

&amp;#x200B;

This money is for the long term 15-20+ years, so I expect and accept volatility with the investments. However, anticipate some regret should I make one of the largest investments of my life and we're hit by a bear market soon after. 

&amp;#x200B;

Any comments, pointers or discussion would be greatly appreciated!",finance
personalfinance,Still struggling after bankruptcy.,"Hi All, just looking for some advice on our finances. Due to circumstances both in and out of our control we filed bankruptcy that wiped out our consumer debt. We were financially okay before that(free childcare,lower rent,in-school deferment on student loans certainly helped), but life has thrown us a few punches. 

We are struggling on what I would consider a healthy net income of $5500/month. I included all of our expenses below. Looking for suggestions on our budget (I use YNAB) as we are starting to feel hopeless.

**Income: $5500/month**

* Rent:  $1200
* Water, Sewer, Trash: $125 
* Electric: $150 
* Childcare: $1200 
* Car Insurance: $150 
* Renter's Insurance: $30  
* Car 1: $250 
* Car 2: $225 
* Cell Phone: $120 
* Internet: $70 
* Subscriptions: (Spotify, Netflix, LastPass,YNAB,): $32 
* Life Insurance: $60 
* Private Student Loans: $365 
* Federal Student Loan 1: $200 
* Federal Student Loan 2: $275 
* Child Costs: $300 (diapers, wipes,  special dietary needs) 
* Groceries/Dining Out: $400 (rarely eat out, once a month maybe twice, and always inexpensive)
* Transportation costs: $300 average 
* Spending Money: $50 
* Job Expenses: $50 

** Total Expenses: $5552**

As you can see we are spending more than we earn. I understand that we can make changes that would bring us below our monthly income(continue to reduce our groceries, child costs, daycare etc). 

Even reducing those costs as low as possible I don't see how we can save an emergency fund or save money period with out increasing our income. I do have the possibility of decent income growth potential once I get some more experience.

Thanks.

edit: Thanks for all of the suggestions. Most of it I was aware of, but wanted to make sure I wasn't missing anything.

edit: To summarize the advice I have received:

Option 1 -

* Save $50 on cell plan. Cheapest option - $70 does not include phone.

* Save either $32 or $12 on subscriptions.

* Save $100 on groceries.

* Public transportation. Move closer. Buy car with no payments with no money.

* Increase Income $1000 - Part Time Job

personalfinance,"Social Media ""Pizza Plugs"" are an obvious scam that no one should ever be involved with.","Within the last few years there have been large amounts of social media accounts (Twitter/instagram/etc.) advertising themselves as “Pizza Plugs^1”, “Chipotle Plugs”, “Doordash Plugs” or similar. These are scammers that are using stolen credit cards to place orders on these services. 

The scammers ascertain stolen credit card numbers from traditional illegal sources and are using the cards to place orders for these food delivery services in an effort to turn these stolen card numbers into cash. The scammers advertise on social media deep discounts with these food delivery services and social media users send the scammers their order and then send money via hard to trace methods like cash app, venmo, paypal, gift cards, etc. These scammers are likely in other countries making catching them difficult. However social media users using these “plugs” are absolutely breaking federal law, using stolen credit cards to ascertain goods.

Really I can’t believe that instagram/twitter/etc. allow these tags as this is an obvious fencing scheme. I know that most r/personalfinance readers are smart enough to stay away from an obvious scam like this, but given their popularity it is something to watch out for with friends and family.

economy,Trade War: Foreign investment in China is still growing at a solid rate,"Every day we hear that America is crushing China with Trump's tariffs and the rest of the measures taken concerning the trade war.

personalfinance,"Help my mother choose a secure investment, please","Okay, let's try this again...

My mother is looking for a relatively safe way to invest $20,000 to $30,000. For over a decade, she has had a savings account at POPULAR bank. She has never had any other type of account at any other bank in this country.

She realizes that she is pretty much not making anything year after year from this money sitting in the Savings account. She is considering buying one or two CDs (and wouldn't have any issues letting them sit for 5 years). I also was reading a little bit on here and it was saying that Ally Bank might be offering a good interest rate as well. 

Would it be safe for me to suggest to her that she can put 70% of this money into the bank CD (or even 2 bank CDs), and then put the other 30% into an Ally Bank savings account?

She is way too scared to consider investing in the stock market and does not even know a thing about credit unions, other than that they would be risky for her (in her opinion). She is nearly 70 and has worked hard for her money, so of course she is hesitant.

Any sort of suggestions or advice would be appreciated. Thank you.",finance

&amp;#x200B;

*Side note: I also have a Perkins loan with a balance of $5,700 with a 5.00% interest rate - fixed.* 

&amp;#x200B;

What do you think is the best strategy for paying this off as quickly as possible while avoiding the most amount of interest as possible? Should I pay off the 6.8% interest rate loans first? And just work my way through paying off the higher interest rates first? 

&amp;#x200B;

Or should I consolidate? Or I could pay off the higher interest rate loans first and then consolidate so that the higher interest rates are not part of the average making up my new interest rate when I consolidate? Without the two 6.8% loans and the two smaller balances of $503.09 and $856.92, my average interest rate for the remaining eight loans would be 4%. I'm fine with paying more each month if I consolidate.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm kind of new to this world. I follow Mr. Money Mustache. I like his philosophy. I'm frugal. My spouse and I live below our means and combined we make around $67K each year. We're thinking about living on my income and throwing all of my spouse's income at these loans - so maybe throwing $20,000-$30,0000 at these loans this year.

* Should I keep all of my loans the way they are with Great Lakes and continue to pay them?

I was going to ask the bank if the program allowed additional payments, so I could possibly have only ~$5,000 left going into the 3rd year, which would allow for a very small monthly payment over the last year, which would be tolerable.

personalfinance,How to find the break-point between paying off low-interest debt or investing?,"I've seen discussions where it's suggested that if your interest rate is very low, you should just keep the debt and make the minimum payments. This definition of ""low interest"" shifts though. I've seen as high as 6% be considered ""low enough to keep."" How do I make this determination? Is it market dependent or more tailored to the individual?

More specifics for my scenario:

________________________________________

4,300 = Monthly gross income  
3,350 = Monthly net income (incl. 3% 401k contribution)  
2,000 = Monthly expenses

Debts:

19,300 = student loans (10,700 @ 3.61%, 8,600 @ 3.15%) - 200/mo minimum  
14,000 = auto loan (4.99%) - 290/mo minimum

Current assets:

14,100 = checking and savings less credit card (current period, no balance carried)

---------------------------------------------------------------------

I purchased the car intending to pay off about $4500 right away, but it looks like that only saves me about $500 in interest over the 54 months of the loan. Cutting into my current assets to save fewer than $10/mo hardly seems worth it. Am I thinking about this wrong?",finance
gaming,Rage 2: The Open World That Anthem Needed but Rage Didn’t,"I bought Rage 2 the day it came out and I’ve put in a decent amount of time playing it (though admittedly, not all that much). Two things have stuck with me during my entire experience: the action is great, the open world backdrop is not. 

Arguably the biggest upside to Rage 2, which I’d say is an overall mediocre game, is that the action sequences are usually a ton of fun. The Doom (2016) influence isn’t just blatant, it’s incredibly welcome. The manic gunfights are almost always entertaining, no matter how repetitive they can feel, and the shotgun is just super enjoyable to use. 

The second thing that has stuck with me is the pointlessness of Rage 2’s open world. I’m not opposed to open world games, quite the opposite actually. But it doesn’t feel like the open world is even remotely necessary. It’s a singleplayer game with little in the way of side stories or interesting side quests. Traveling around the map is fun…for about 30 minutes. Having to travel to certain areas are mind-numbingly boring. Fast travel is painfully limited to very few areas. Areas that are nowhere near the important mission areas you’ll have to visit several times. For example, last night I had to return to one of the 3 primary mission givers in the game. The time spent with this particular character was incredibly short with the travel time getting to him being at least 4 to 5 times longer than the time spent with him. That’s unacceptable. The open world is so pointless that they stuffed it full of needless minigames and discoverable areas that add nothing to the overall enjoyment of the game.

The funniest thing I have found myself thinking while playing Rage 2 is that its open world is terrible for Rage 2 but would’ve been perfect for Anthem. Anyone who played Anthem when it launched (not that things have improved that greatly since then) were met with an empty, lifeless open world with no waypoints to get around and a total lack of content. For a game that was meant to rival Destiny, it missed the mark entirely. Whereas Rage 2’s open world feels pointless within its own game, it would have been perfect for Anthem. The side quests and annoying minigames would be much more interesting and fun in a game like Anthem where it’s 4 friends running around grinding for loot. Doom (2016) was able to accomplish the same sort of leveling mechanics without using pointless open world grinding (the presence of the open world almost surely is the reason why there are way too many types of upgrade currencies). Rage 2 would’ve benefitted greatly from not being open world (or at least a pared down version of it) while Anthem would’ve benefitted greatly from having Rage 2’s style of open world environment.

Tl;dr: Rage 2 didn’t need a giant open world full of pointless content, Anthem did. Just because a game can have an open world environment doesn’t mean it should.",technology

I’m new to the world of not being an idiot. I recently got real with my finances and paid off 18k in credit card debt by living below my means and getting a part time job side hustle.

I've always known that I need to save, and have been quite good at it, but financial literacy beyond saving has never been a strong point. Long story short, I have amassed about $160k in traditional savings with a low interest rate (33 years old). A 6-month emergency fund for me would be \~$18k and a full-year emergency fund would be \~36k, but beyond that I need to move much of this money into something that will make me more money. My go-to idea is a HYSA thanks to all of the reading I've done on here (Ally seems like the best bet, even if their rates are a bit lower than others?). Additionally, would it actually pay to put some of this into a CD to earn a bit more interest, or should I be looking at something else, perhaps Vanguard-related? Not especially into risk with this money, mostly want it to grow and produce something more for me than it currently is in the local credit union. I intend to keep some money there in a money market account with higher interest, but not much of it.

### National (USA or any nation) monetary policy : 

### The fact is, in 1933 the U.S.A.  GAVE UP IT'S SOVEREIGNTY, and became a debter nation with the NATIONAL BANKING ACT OF 1933, AS SUCH....  FDR... found an unconstitutional way to force all the people(emergency war powers)... to become subject to pay that debt to creditors who then own our nation as collateral.     The problem now being that we owe the debt for not only the 200 Billion a year, plus the commonly known 19 Trillion dollars, but also we would need to re-value all DOLLARS in circulation or risk their devaluation which can add up to 100-200 maybe 300 Trillion dollars.   And so, the problem is, we..  like most nations do not have the gold. we already paid all our gold as interest payments and have run out, and as such, our government has enslaved our people to pay excess taxation to pay the debt to our creditors who NOW RULE OUR NATION, AND WORLD.      WE ALL GOT ROBBED....  and I propose a fix... NORMALLY we could not pay off the debt because THAT would require a vault of gold to pay it off, and WE HAVE NO GOLD...   but...   we do have vast land...   with vast mining potential, and if we, say by A constitutional amendment allowed our Federal Government to run vast mining sites using prison labor, then we as a NATION...  could..  have the viable..  realistic...  predictable...  credit potential.. to pay off all our nation's debts.. and revalue our currency to a stable, non-inflationary value, and so end the endless drain which has been the national debt.      I CAN MAKE IT HAPPEN.SEE --- &gt;   [http://caliphofgod.org/SOVEREIGN-NATIONAL-ECONOMICS/](http://caliphofgod.org/SOVEREIGN-NATIONAL-ECONOMICS/)

I have just inherited 50 thousand dollars. as the title says. I have never had this much money ever, and would really like second opinions on what to do with it.

I’m 19.
Full time student, part time jobs (earn around 15k/year).
No student loans, up to bachelors degree covered (Starting Junior year in the fall). If I decide to get a masters it is unknown if it will be covered (calculated at $35k). As of right now I will be aiming to get my masters.
No debt.
Own a car.
Live with parents.

Here’s what I was planning on doing.
Take 10k and split it amongst my Roth IRA, Traditional IRA, and brokerage accounts. 
Take 10k every 3 months and put it into a 1 year CD. The goal would be to create a rolling CD effect so A) I get the best interest rates and B) I will have access to my money every 3 months if I need to pay for my masters or something.

Before the money goes anywhere it will hang out in my Discover savings at 2.1%APY.

If I get 1,000 dollars I would feel much more comfortable putting it somewhere. This is such a large, life changing amount, I would really like to do the right thing. Any advice would be appreciated really!

Thank you!

personalfinance,"31 yr old just graduated with MA. $84, 615 in debt. Debating Should I invest in IRAs or pay off my debt?","Hey all,

I am debating what is best for my situation. I am a 31 year old and have not yet invested or anything. I have some credit debt, but plan on paying it off in the next 6 months ($652). I'm going into education and i'll start work in August. I would begin making salary. I haven't signed a contract, but I am expecting to make between 65-85k my first year (gross). Being that it is in education, I'll be paying in to CALstrs. This is a retirement fund. I want to begin investing as soon as possible. 

&amp;#x200B;

My main debt is school, $84, 615 (all fed) at an interest rate of 5.6%. It feels high compared to my income. I want to eventually refinance to decrease the interest rate. Im expecting my fixed bills to be around 600-650. I am considering moving back to where Im from (rather than a large metropolitan area) to lower my rent price. Where I am living now, the average rent for a room is $1400-$1800 vs moving to my hometown where I could share an apartment and pay $600 on rent. 

&amp;#x200B;

When I looked at budgeting, everything added up and the debt seems overwhelming. I'm going to need to pay $775 a month to pay it off in 10 years. This seems like a bad position to be in considering my age. I'd like to retire at a good age and be comfortable. However, I feel like i'm starting too late.

&amp;#x200B;

Should I aggressively pay off my loan to shave off time and interest then invest? I know that it is suggested to pay debt off first, but I wonder if that is best for someone at my age? I was hoping others had advice on my situation.

personalfinance,401K Interest/Payoff Question,"Hello! I’m going to try to make a long story short... I am currently a 21 year old college student, and my car just went out. I need reliable transportation, but lack the credit history needed to obtain a reasonable car loan. My mother is comfortable with taking out a 401K loan for a 5 year duration. The loan is in the amount of $8,800. The payments (I am unsure of the exact interest rate) are $174, meaning if I take the full duration to pay the loan, I will pay $10,440. My goal is to pay as little interest as possible (trying to pay off within a year). 
I understand that you often have to pay the loan in full (cannot pay a little extra each month), and plan to set aside a savings account with money. When I have enough, I will pay the loan in full. My question is... if I pay the remainder of the loan in one year, will I still pay the full $10,440? Or, will I only have to pay the remaining principal at that point, thus saving myself four years of interest?
I understand that each situation is unique and that I should get a guaranteed answer through my mother and her 401K plan - I am looking just for a general idea. It is a unique scenario, as the interest I pay will not benefit myself.

personalfinance,Pay off mortgage or keep payments?,"Hi all,

I am an expat and I have the option to take out a loan to pay off my (weird l, awful) mortgage in one go. I would love to read some opinions on whether I should take the loan to pay the mortgage off or not. The conditions are:

- My mortgage is not in amount of currency owned, but ""units"" that vary year to year. So every year since I took it out, they've risen about 5%. This means I now owe more than I originally took out.

- I've paid for about 4 full years now. The payments are rather small for my current salary, but I'd be obligated to pay for another 26 years, ending up paying about double what I currently owe. After 30 years of payment I am clear, even if the account is not fully paid.

- If I take out the loan, it'll be a 48mo, ~8% yearly. The mortgage itself has a 6% yearly interest rate (on top of the whole ""increasing unit"" thing).

- The loan would put me in a limited but not awful financial position. I live simply as it is, I wouldn't be able to save but hey, debts first right?

- Taxes are not an issue here, either with the loan or with the paying off.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions

The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

personalfinance,Selling our home and purchasing a new one. Should we take some of the money from the sale and erase a few debts?,"Good morning, r/personalfinance!

I’m going to keep this as fact oriented and concise as possible. 

Age matters. We’re in our mid 30’s. 

We have our current home paid off to where we have 78% equity. We have lived there for 8 years. It is a 3 hour round trip, 5 days a week to my work, equaling 60 miles per day.
I drive a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle paid for by my business. It gets about 100mpg when factoring electric only and fuel use combined.
My wife’s car is an SUV for hauling our 3 kids around. We owe 85% of the financed amount on her car.

Our new home is located 1 mile from my work, effectively eliminating the need for fuel for me, and lowering it significantly for my wife when she comes in to work.

With the cash left over from the sale of our current home, we should be able to put 50% of the new home’s cost as a down payment, keeping our monthly mortgage within budget on a 30 year.

My thought is to keep enough cash out (around 12%) to pay off some small debts, pay off her car (at 5% interest rate) and give us a comfortable rainy day fund to build off of. This would essentially reset our lives to be more manageable.

My wife agrees, with one concern.

Her worry is that we would be paying off a car over a 30 year period. My counter to that is that only happens when you take out a HELOC or similar to consolidate debt.

We both see where the other could be right. 

So now we leave it to you geniuses (meant sincerely, not sarcastically).

Given what you know about our finances from this post, what would you suggest we do?

If you need more information, please let me know. We would prefer not to give exact numbers and instead use percentages. If that is a problem, we can give real numbers.

EDIT 1: Our new mortgage should be right at 4% over 30 years.",finance

personalfinance,Refinancing an Auto Loan - Could use some perspective on what to do,"**tl;dr This ended up longer that I intended, probably for no good reason.  Simple question is longer loan/lower payment + extra towards principle or shorter loan + lower interest**

Hey folks - quick backstory, I've been very slowly digging myself out of a poor credit hole from my college years.  It's going up little by little, and next paycheck I'll have all of my collections paid off finally, and only have School Loans and a small CC(w/ 100% on time and full monthly payments) left as well as this auto loan.

The loan itself required I had a co-signer, which was my mother's SO who has great credit himself, and yet they still stuck me with a 10% interest.  At the time, it was my literal only option because I had to roll my current car into it, which I'm sure was the biggest reason for the higher interest.

I'm coming up on a year of owning it(2014 Mazda CX-5) and 100% on-time payments.  I still owe just under 18k, and my monthly payments are about $380.

I'm comfortable paying $380, and we're trying to save up some money to get a home loan next year.  We were approved for FHA as long as we had the down payment, so giving ourselves a year to save and have our wedding + gift money, we figure is better than rushing into it now.

Since that's not until next year, I am looking at what I can do with this auto loan.  I'd like to get it just under my name if possible, but my family member isn't pushing to get his name off it or anything, I just want to be more responsible for my own.  They said he would have to appear first on the loan at the time, not sure if that matters at all, it's still showing on my credit as well.

I'd like to ultimately get the interest down, 10% is insane, I haven't called around yet but when I do here's the 2 things I'm not sure which way to go

1.)  Extend the loan out with lower monthly payments and lower interest, but continue paying $380 month so even if I get it down to $300, I'm paying a bit extra towards the principle
2.) Shorten the loan/keep it at it's current length and just see about getting a lower interest rate while maintaining about the same monthly payment
3.) Other options??

When meeting with the mortage lady, at the time she had mentioned bringing my debt to income ratio down by lowering the monthly car payment.  While that doesn't matter so much right this moment since we're putting it off for a year, is it still a good way to go? or was that her trying to get me into a loan?

Apologies for the length.  I've never really had good credit and this past year is the first time I've started buckling down and getting my shit together.  I'm very unfamiliar with refinancing and loans in general, so if some of this seems like common sense, I'm just trying to learn.

personalfinance,Mid-Career Planning - 20 years from retirement?,"Been casually following this sub and was hoping to get some advice. Unfortunately we got a bit of a late start, but think we are getting on track now.  

***Situation***:  Married in our late 30’s with no children living in a HCOL with a combined income of ~$215k.

***Goal***:  Health insurance will likely be a big factor in our decision, but hoping to retire early around 55-58 (20 years) if it makes sense. We will likely move to a LCOL possibly with no state taxes, but too early to tell. We would like to travel some and it’s possible we could continue to bring in a little income on the side or switch to part-time.  

***Savings***: Definitely a weak area in constant flux anywhere from $5k-$15k depending on what is going on at that time. We took a few trips and got stuck with an unexpected tax bill plus penalties this year which have us down a bit now, but will get it back up.

***Retirement***:  Spouse is a FERS employee hired pre 2013 so still 0.8% I believe. Also contributes 10% to TSP (plus 5% match) with a ~$100k balance in a targeted date fund (2038). I have a traditional 401(k) I’m maxing out (plus 8% company match) with a ~$125k balance.  My mix is currently very aggressive which does concern me, but I’ve seen 20% or better returns 4 of the last 5 years (knock on wood) so have been letting it ride.  

***Debt***:  Not horrible, but not great either. Spouse struggled with credit cards early on which was compounded by some unexpected health issues in the family, but have had that under control for a few years now.  

Home = ~$285k @ 4.75% - Close to 20% equity which would remove PMI.  
Auto = ~$7k @ 3.71% - Has ~46k miles, probably upgrade before warranty runs out at 100k.  
Student = ~$70k @ 6% - Interest rate varies because we have 3 different federal loans, but that looks like about the average.  Spouse is eligible for student loan forgiveness and believe we should receive $10k in the fall which will help.  
Other = $3k @ 0% - Home upgrades at 18 months no APR if paid in full and on track.  Might utilize this again in the winter.  

***My optimistic outlook***:  Assuming nothing happens to my spouse’s pension, I feel like we are in pretty good shape. If that were to get cut, they could move to private sector fairly easy and get an immediate increase in base pay plus probably some short-term incentives. If we do move to a LCOL area, could probably sell our house and buy something for a fraction of the cost or go back to renting which would help.  

***Next steps***:  With the market possibly turning I’ve been debating changing my 401(k) mix to something more conservative or even reduce my contributions so we can pay more towards our debt. Recently it was recommended we max my spouses TSP out, but I’ve never thought it was a particularly good investment choice. Alternatively I’ve been debating starting a Roth-IRA for each of us which would help bridge the gap to our current retirement, but need to get our savings back up and probably should be doing more to reduce our debt.",finance
personalfinance,Rent vs. Buy: Accept financial slavery or risk financial ruin?,"Hey /r/personalfinance! I would love your help in processing my options for housing. 

I recently moved to a gentrifying city, and am having a hard time with the cost of housing. For reference:

* I am an engineer making 65k, 

* 4.5k in savings, 

* 4.5k credit card debt (to my shame)

* One car, which is paid off. 

* My wife is pregnant with our second child, and is looking to work from home as a grant writer, with no luck yet. 

Scenario 1: Accept Financial Slavery

Right now, we are renting for $1,250/month, but our lease is ending on June 12, at which point we MUST move out, and our rent rises to $1,500 for any decent 3-bedroom apartment. Unfortunately, with the state of our student loans and other finances, that level of rent leaves us with very little savings each month, if any. Our present savings would go towards first month’s/last month’s rent + deposit. With the city’s pace of growth, rent will only continue to increase, and my salary will likely stagnate for a few years (I started at 45k at this company 10 months ago), until we are priced out of the city altogether. I call this scenario Financial Slavery, because it will drain all our resources just to stay afloat, with no gain in savings or equity in a home. 

Scenario 2: Risk Financial Ruin

Once Scenario 1 became clear, my wife began looking into purchasing a home, out of a desperate hope that we can escape the escalation of rent with a fixed-rate mortgage. We got pre-approved for a 30-year mortgage, 3.6% fixed interest rate, up to $200k with 3% down. 

Such a small down payment means that we would be required to have mortgage insurance. All told, between principal, interest, property taxes, homeowners’ insurance, and mortgage insurance, our monthly payment on a 200k mortgage would be $1,233, which lets us (slowly) save for inevitable household expenses. There are some decent 10-year-old 3-bedroom homes for sale in our area for ~$180k, but they are generally posted on Thursday and sold by that Sunday. We’ve seen a few gems come and go already. 

The problem is that we had prepared for a new round of renting, and don’t have enough for a down payment, let alone closing costs and move-in costs. The only way that I can see us paying for those is by taking out a separate $8k loan or putting them on a credit card. I call this scenario: Financial Ruin. 

Because of the rent increases, we don’t think we could save enough for a down payment if we waited a year. More likely, our savings would dwindle to nothing. It feels like a do-or-die situation.

personalfinance,Are private student loans a bad idea?,"I will be graduating next spring with approximately $25,000 in federal student loans. I'm planning to go into data analysis, lab management, or something similar so I anticipate that I will be able to find a decently paying job right out of school. My family currently pays the rest of my tuition that my loans don't cover, but I'm on my own for living expenses. Last semester I struggled with food insecurity and was so stressed about not having enough money to cover my expenses, even while working multiple jobs, that it absolutely tanked my grades and I'm now on academic suspension. I can bring myself up from suspension with summer classes thankfully, but unfortunately that means I can't afford to work full time and also take summer classes, so I won't be able to save up as much money as I hoped to. I really need to focus on school next year since I will be taking much harder classes. 

My mom has told me that private student loans are predatory and that I should NEVER EVER take one. But I can't handle having to skip meals again and have breakdowns over not knowing how I'm going to afford my bills. I don't want to use a credit card but I've had them before so I know my credit score is decent.

personalfinance,Seeking 401K investment allocation advice,"Hello,

Some background information on me: I have little personal investment experience, and what I know I have researched myself so please excuse my lack of knowledge. I am 31 years old and my salary is currently 61,500. I am married (as of December 29, 2019), and have approximately 18,000 in my Roth IRA (and have also opened a Roth IRA for my wife and funded it with 6,000). I fund the Roth IRAs with a mutual fund account (part of an inheritance from my grandmother) which currently contains about 35,000. I also have a 401k, which is the subject of this post, which contains approximately 18,000. 

Recently, my employer switched from MassMutual to Fidelity as the company responsible for handling my 401k. The company matches 4% if I contribute 5%, and there is an additional 4% profit sharing on top (so they really match 8% for my 5%). As I am not actively contributing to my Roth IRA currently (because my mutual funds are feeding my and my wife's Roths), I have upped the contributions to my 401k to 7% (and I might assess increasing this amount depending on the impact it has to my lifestyle, if any). 

My question is, how should I allocate my investments? BlackRock Target Funds are offered, but it seems as though I may be able to avoid some of the expense ratio by selecting my own investments, but I'm not sure if it is worth it or not. I am also wondering if it is necessary to periodically reallocate my investments/what I need to do as far as management of my 401k going forward. Here are the funds my 401k allows for investment:

solar,Clarity on the Federal Tax Credit/ITC,"I've seen a couple of IRS forms completed (5695) for the 2018 tax year. I wasn't paying that close attention, but I remember seeing notes that unused credit could be applied to the 2019 return. It was very clear to me that the form ONLY specifically mentioned 2019, however it didn't explicitly say it could or could not be carried over for multiple years.

Someone noted to me that the Energy Sage website claims that the rolling forward is not limited at all. I've often found mistakes on that site, so I'm curious what the real IRS ruling has been recently. Searching around today I haven't found either a definitive writing from a tax attorney, or an article addressing that ruling specifically (if there has been one). Nor do I find any other website including SEIA that even covers that issue in any granular detail.

personalfinance,Starting to feel burnt out from aggressive debt pay-off. Does my plan look okay?,"Really brief synopsis of my (27F) situation: I make 54k pre-tax at my full-time job and side hustle as a waitress. This usually provides me with an additional $600+ a month post-tax. I am contributing to the state retirement system which is currently 6.6% of my pre-tax income and is then matched at 100%. I have a 15k emergency fund. 

Over the past two years of side hustling I've been able to build the big emergency fund and pay off my car. Now, I want to aggressively pay down my student loan debt of 28k with a 5% interest rate. However, with a big vacation and a potential future wedding coming up, I still am contributing to savings. I put $800 a month into my Ally savings and $1000 towards students loan. Once I get the student loan balance to less than 20k and my savings to above 20k, I'm considering totally wiping out loans and being left with a 1k emergency fund.

How does this plan sound? Wanted to do a quick check-in. Thank you!",finance
personalfinance,Pay off student loans or open high yield savings account?,"Hi all,  
  
I've been very frugal over the past few years, and in conjunction with a windfall in a wage dispute with a former employer last year, I currently have about $40k in my CHECKING account (stupid I know, but I just don't know what I want to do with it yet). I have a Roth IRA that I opened last year, to which I contributed the max $5500.    
  
Background on me -- I'm late 20s, with ~$13k in student loans ($211/month payment). I'm a freelancer, so my income per month fluctuates, but I usually pull in about $4k net. My nut for rent/food/entertainment/monthly student loan payment is about $2k so I am usually able to sock away cash even when I have a slower month freelancing.  
  
My goal for the next year or so is to buy a home. I live in a major US city, where starter homes are about $400-500k, so I have a ways to go on getting a down payment together. For this reason, I'm reluctant to put my money into a CD for fear of losing it/not having access to it.  
  
My student loan principal is $13k, average interest rate of about %5, and I should be done paying it off in 5 years. Should I just knock this thing out now, or does it make more sense to drop my nest egg into a high interest savings account and continue paying the $211/month on the student loans?  
  
Sidenote, I have excellent credit (784), but I assume closing the student loan account would hurt that?  
  
Thank you all!",finance
personalfinance,Should I pay off my student loans in full?,"I currently have various student loans with a payoff balance of just under $50,000. The interest rate on the loans are 6.55%. I am paying $312 per month as part of an income-based repayment plan. About $100 goes towards the principal balance each month and the rest goes to interest.

I am currently on a Public Loan Service Forgiveness program. I have seven years of payments left before I am eligible to have the full balance of my loans forgiven.

I currently have the funds to pay off my loans in full from my wife’s life insurance policy payout. After paying for the loans I would have $17,000 left in my savings. I have no other debt outside of my student loans.

I currently bring home $3,800 monthly after taxes and my two young children receive Social Security benefits from my wife in the amount of $1,050 monthly (for a total of $2,100). I have monthly expenses of $3,000 so I am saving an average of $2,900 each month.

I am also currently renting my home but would like to be able to purchase a home eventually.

So my question is should I pay off the loans in full in order to clear this debt or should I ride it out hoping that this program will remain in place for seven more years? My worry is that the program is dissolved before I am eligible for forgiveness and then I am left with all this additional interest that has built up over the years.

personalfinance,I don’t like any of the higher education savings options but need to start something for my daughter. Is there a decent option I’m missing?,"I’m looking into 529, UTMA, and ESA (Coverdell). We have $15,000 to put in now (she was born this year) and plan to put in about $3000 per year from now on. 

529 and UTMA are subject to gift limit of $15,000 annually. Our annual income is $185k gross. 

**UTMA:**

Big drawback of UTMA is that they are seen as child’s assets and can negatively impact child’s federal financial aid. You as parents are the custodian on the account until child turns 18. The child would be given access and control at 18 and they could not be ready to use it wisely. 


**529:**

Big drawback of 529 is that it must be used on educational expenses. If it’s not used for educational expenses, the amount you withdraw must include the earnings of the distribution as taxable income and pay an extra 10% penalty on earnings. 
I.e. Withdraw $10k non-qualified distribution — $8k is contributions and $2k is earnings. $2k goes to taxable income, and you pay a $200 penalty (10%).


**ESA:**

ESA (Coverdell) phases out at $190k-$220 joint and you can contribute up to $2,000 per year. You make financial decisions on this account, but are not the custodian of the account when child is a minor; bank is the custodian. $2,000 is the max for everyone who contributes to an ESA for the child. So, parents and grandparents cannot contribute $2,000 each - that’s a breach of the limit. The financial aid angle is seen similar to the 529.

**Dilemma:** 

I don’t like any of them. UTMA is least restrictive but puts a lot of money in the hands of a young adult who may not be ready for it. 529/ESA — it’s so hard to know what college will be like in 18 years. Will it be free? $150,000 a year? Will trade schools be more common? What if she starts her own business instead of college?",finance

investing,Morgan Stanley says economy is on ‘recession watch’ as bond market flashes warning,"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/28/morgan-stanley-says-economy-on-recession-watch-amid-bond-warning.html

&gt; That usual upward slope can change, however, when investors think economic output growth is likely to fall. That occurred earlier this year, when the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield first fell below that of the 3-month Treasury bill, a sign many on Wall Street read as a recessionary signal.

&gt; The curve flattened further Tuesday as the 3-month bill yielded 2.356% and the 10-year note yielded 2.269%.

&gt; Some investors wrote it off, saying “it’s different this time” thanks to the Federal Reserve’s lingering quantitative easing or by how quickly the curve appeared to correct to a steeper shape. But Morgan Stanley’s deeper dive into the data — controlling for the Fed’s tinkering — reveals a “much different picture.”

&gt; Morgan Stanley’s analysis shows the adjusted yield curve first inverted in November and has remained in negative territory ever since.

&gt; “The adjusted yield curve inverted last November and has remained in negative territory ever since, surpassing the minimum time required for a valid meaningful economic slowdown signal,” Wilson wrote. “It also suggests the ‘shot clock’ started 6 months ago, putting us ‘in the zone’ for a recession watch.”",finance

personalfinance,"Best places to store for long-term purchases (car, house)","Hello!

I'm currently married with two kids.

My job currently provides me with housing. We don't pay rent, we don't have a mortgage, we have a place to live and pay taxes on that benefit.

The downside to this we're also not gaining any equity, so it's up to us to save as much as possible to make up for this. There's also a possibility that a job location change will require us to rent or buy a home, so I need to be ready for that possibility. But there's also a possibility that I will not need to buy a home until retirement (~30 years from now).

We own both of our cars outright, but we currently make car payments to ourselves to ideally pay cash for a new (or new-to-us) car when the time comes.

That's a lot of introduction to get to my main questions. Where should I be storing the savings for both the potential home purchase and a future car purchase?

My current plan is that we have our car savings in a Discover savings account. It brings in about 2% interest and is as liquid as can be. This account is also used for car repairs and other expenses (tires, registrations, etc.). I've thought about tucking a chunk of this away in a CD, but the truth is that the interest rate boost you get doesn't seem worth it for the lack of liquidity. Is there a better place to put that that has better return but also is rather liquid?

We have two retirement accounts setup, a Roth IRA and another account. The latter can't be touched until retirement, but I've been view contributions to the Roth IRA has future house payments since I can withdraw what I've contributed without penalty or tax implications. If we need it for a down payment it's there, but as long as we don't need it, it's growing like a standard retirement fund. If we don't need it until we retire, then we are it'll just continue to grow.

Do these choices make sense? Are there better options I should consider? Thanks!

tl;dr: Saving for a future car in a Discover savings at 2% interest. Saving for a home (that may or may not need to be purchased before retirement) in a Roth IRA, with the idea of using the principle for a down payment. Better ideas?",finance
personalfinance,Fixed vs Variable home loans,"Hi there! New to the club. 

My partner and I are about to take the plunge and get into our first mortgage. For context we live in Australia where interest rates are expected to go down in the near future. We also plan to live in our property for at least the next 5 years.

We are leaning towards a 100% variable home loan starting at 3.55% interest rate (We thought about a 50/50 split variable and fixed but it just ended up working out the same as a 100% fixed rate).

I wanted to hear how the people of reddit who also chose to do a 100% variable rate have faired. Have you had any difficulties? Any triumphs?

I understand the risks of a variable rate as well as the rewards but I don’t know anything from people who have actually gone ahead and done the 100% variable rate. Our fall back is if interest rates start to go up and we get worried we can always change to a fixed rate. Is this a solid plan?",finance
personalfinance,Can cosigning for spouse's med school loan be bad for the household?,"Hi, the question may be too specific but I would appreciate some input from anyone with experience/expertise. I'll be on my 3rd year of med school in US and I'm about to take out another substantial loan for this year as I have been doing for the past 2. 

I got married b/w 2nd and 3rd year so I wanted to put my wife as a cosigner, but she is concerned that 

1. It will hurt our credits and income/dept balance that we may get a worse deal on a mortgage in the future when we try to buy a home. 
2. Off-chance something happens to me that she'll be responsible for a mountain of dept that I have if I'm gone. 

Is the first point true? I've heard from my peers that it would be relatively easy for me to get a mortgage once I get my degree and start practicing because doctors are a safe investment for banks. I have no idea if this is based on any fact/experience of other doctors.

For the second point, I read online of taking out a life-insurance just in case.

I kinda agree w/ my wife's points as I have no idea how much having a cosigner will decrease my interest rate, if any, so the downsides (if they're true) would outweigh the benefits (lower interest rate?). I would appreciate some advise on these matters. Thank you!",finance
personalfinance,Calculating state withholding taxes,"Hi guys, I recently got a credit card to build my credit score slowly.

personalfinance,Break even point of purchasing a home?,"I'm in my early-mid 30s and I just moved to LA a month ago from San Diego for my fed govt job. I've been all over California for the last 10 years but I should be settling down in LA with my wife. We were thinking of buying a home in the near future but we were also considering of moving out of California someday because it is overcrowded and too expensive. We have put that thought on hold and I will stay in LA at least a few years to grow in my career field. I just got promoted per my contract so I am making $71k/yr and a year from now it will be $85k/yr then the raises slow down to about $2,500/yr if you understand the GS payscale and step increases.

&amp;#x200B;

Our current rent is $1,900/mo with utilities for a 1 bedroom apartment and we were looking to buy a 2-3 bedroom house. Since housing sucks in SoCal, a cheap home is about $500k which looks like $2,300/mo since I don't have to deal with PMI since I have the VA loan. Currently, $1,900 is my take home pay every 2 weeks after taxes, retirement, and health insurance for both of us.

&amp;#x200B;

We were looking to buy a home in LA 1 year from now and live here for at least the next 3 years. We would only move away if I can find a higher grade job in the future which would be a GS-13 which is \~$100k but would be less in most other areas since lower cost of living which is acceptable but most likely the alternative is Washington DC where my family is at and cost of living is equitable to here. If we bought a home and sold it within 4 years, could I be putting myself at huge risk? I have never purchased a home but I figure, the equity of 4 years of payment towards the mortgage is better than paying 4 years in rent to someone else but I don't know what the closing costs and fees would be like to purchase a home valued at about $500k. Home values could tank, especially in California since they are terribly inflated but even if they remain stagnant, would it be good to purchase to get equity into a property? I was thinking of renting out the other room(s) or my wife would start a home childcare or elderly care facility since she has experience in both and has her CNA cert. I don't think it would be possible to do that in condos since HOAs would go against that.

&amp;#x200B;

The other part is purchasing a home quite too expensive for my current salary since the rule seems to be to make 3x your mortgage and a mortgage of $2,300 would require $6,900/mo which I should make close to next year

&amp;#x200B;

My wife has a degree from another country and has just moved here a year ago so she is just working part time gigs until she can find a good job and is currently taking courses to get into a nursing program.

We have no debts, no CC payments, both cars paid off. I have perfect credit, $40k in stocks, $18k in retirement, $8k savings. I know I should have more in retirement for my age and should have about 6-9 months in savings.. still working on that. It has been hard to build it up since I have been supporting my wife the last 2 years.

personalfinance,"As part of a new job, I have to divest from specific assets. Is there any way for me to avoid tax penalty, considering I have a retirement account that holds these assets?","Context: I start a new job with the government in a regulatory agency. A condition of the job is to divest from any direct or indirect holdings in securities of banks, savings associations, and their affiliates. 

My issue: I have a Roth IRA account through USAA that is composed of mutual funds. I'm concerned that my money is (most likely) being used to invest in securities of banks, etc which would be prohibited as part of the ethics guidelines. Considering that USAA is also a federal savings association that is regulated, I'm not sure if I need to remove those funds from USAA to transfer to a different retirement account approved by my agency.

The problem I have is that while I don't get taxed on the nominal amount (since it's already been taxed), I will still receive a 10% tax on earnings due to being an early withdrawal. 

Is there anything I can **legally** do to prevent that early penalty if I *must* remove my funds? Worst case scenario I bite the bullet and pay the penalty. Much appreciated for any guidance!",finance

personalfinance,I checked my Credit Score for the first time in years and my Equifax report says I've missed 6 payments from my University I can't find and I have an outstanding collection that I've already paid twice.,"I graduated college in the US 2 years ago with around 30k in student loans. I pay my loans through FedLoan servicing and I pay minimum payment on all the loans and over pay on the highest interest loans. I have always paid on time. 

So I was very surprised to see on my credit report that it said I had missed 6 payments from my University. All my other loans are listed under FedLoan but the one I've missed payments is listed under my University. 

I logged into my student account and it said I had everything paid and I had no outstanding balance. It actually said I was completely paid up. So I am very confused about where this loan is. The loan is also not even listed on my TransAmerica report, just the Equifax report.

Also there is an outstanding collection listed from an emergency room visit in 2013 of $105. In 2013 I got calls from collection agencies, so I paid it. A year later I got harrassing calls from 2014-2015 for the same amount and I got tired of it so I paid it. Then in 2016 I started receiving calls again and I told them I've already paid twice. Then I moved far away and got a new number. But it still shows up on my Equifax as outstanding. And again this does not show up on my TransAmerica report.

I am not quite sure what to do to get these off of my credit report. If the University loan is actually legitimate I want to pay it off. I just dont know where to find it. If it's not legitimate I want to get it off my report. Same with the $105 collection, except I know I've paid that. Twice.",finance

solar,5 quotes for 5 completely different solar installations in South Florida,"I've met and/or spoken with 5 different solar installation companies and have more questions than when before I started researching. I broke apart the areas of my questions and I hope someone here has experience regarding these questions I have. I live in South Florida and have a concrete barrel tile roof that is the original when the house was built in 2001, so 18 years old. No leaks. Tilt is 24°, if that matters for this discussion.

&amp;#x200B;

Different Solar Panel Manufactures:

Every one is using a different solar panel manufacture and everyone is saying theirs is the best and they are the only installation company authorized to sell and install ""their"" type. A few said their solar panels are more durable even if they took a hit and showed me samples of the ""competition"" that crumbled in to pieces once I gave the slightest pressure. The solar cell they used cracked under the same pressure, but didn't fall apart. They also claim their panels would still generate electricity even if it was cracked where as all the others would fail.

&amp;#x200B;

Micro Inverters vs 1 Inverter:

Some companies are using micro inverters installed on each panels and others are saying micro inverters are inefficient and one single inverted mounted on the side of the house is better. They said with micro inverters, if one goes down, the rest will still work where as with a single inverter, you have a point of failure and the whole system will be down without it. 

The companies quoting inverters seem to all be quoting the same exact model, SolarEdge, SE7600H-US and say micro inverters are inefficient. One company also says if the inverter goes down, they will pay me back for the lost power I could have been generating until it is fixed by them through their 25 year warranty.

&amp;#x200B;

One company only looked at my monthly Electric bill and quoted me a 16.6 kW system with 44 Mission Solar Energy panels which puts me a Tier 2 and requires a million dollar insurance policy for an extra $250 a year cost which they then said I wouldn't have to renew next year. Another company is saying a 9.96 kW system with 31 panels using Hanwah Q Cells.( with Hybrid HW heater and more insulation)

&amp;#x200B;

Hybrid Hot Water Heater vs standard:

Others told me I needed to blow more insulation in to my attic for a 20% reduction on my electric bill and also upgrade my 5 month old Hot Water heater to a Hybrid Hot Water heater to gain another 10% savings. With this, I would only need a 9 kW Solar install using less panels and close to $10,000 less overall cost before the Fed Tax credit. 

&amp;#x200B;

One company about 2 years ago that quoted me offered to install heat ducts against the plywood under my roof to channel the heat away from my attic which would also reduce the heat in my attic.

&amp;#x200B;

Everyone is saying I have a good Southern exposure and can do solar, however only one company suggested I cut down a really tall palm tree in from of my house as it could cause some shade in the late afternoon.

&amp;#x200B;

Roof

One company said due to the age of my roof, 18 years old, they should replace it along with installing Solar panels and some of the roof install ""might"" qualify for the solar credit. I was thinking I could stretch another 10 years with my existing roof, but if there is a chance of getting a discount on the roof cost, I am leaning towards that option.

&amp;#x200B;

Is there a way to compare which solar panels are more efficient? Either with or without a micro inverter?

Is there a study or comparison of micro inverters on each panel vs 1 single inverter?

More than one company is using SolarEdge, however one company said they are the only authorized seller of SolarEdge which are made in Israel.(?) maybe I mixed up the country of origin.

&amp;#x200B;

Has anyone gone with a Hybrid Hot Water Heater and noticed any results?

I was also thinking of replacing one of my AC units which is 18 years old. I have two. The other unit is about 3 years old and 16 seer so it should be fine. Would I or should I reduce the number of panels to lower my initial cost expecting my kW usage to be lower?

personalfinance,"$30k debt in student loans, looking to buy a home in 2-3 years. Is it better to aggressively pay of the loans or save the cash?","Hi!

As the title says, I'm looking at buying my first home in the next 2-3 years. I expect the cheapest I will buy at is between $300-400k (in the DMV).

I have about $30k in student debt that is not at a fixed rate and the interest rates are currently between 5 and 5.5%. 

I currently have about $8k in savings and another $6k in an IRA which I began before starting my current job which has great retirement benefits. I haven't put anything into my IRA since starting.

Other than my student debt, I am debt free. A full half my income goes towards rent and the other half is discretionary.

Finally, I am eligible for a VA loan, so a lower down payment is possible. 

Would it be better to get my loans paid down and improve my debt-to-income ratio, or should I pay the minimums and save all that I can for a larger down payment plus fees and other expenses associated with buying?

personalfinance,What would you do: live at home or move closer to work?,"Hi all! I am looking for advice as to what you would do in my current situation.

&amp;#x200B;

I live with my parents but work in another city. I currently commute a total of roughly 500 miles a week with a car that has 135000 miles. I have found an apartment that meets all the criteria I am looking for (location, bike/walk commute to work, downtown, etc) that is $840 a month for 740sqft (cheapest I will find for this size in this location). I estimate it to be roughly **$950** a month which includes electricity and internet. Those are the only utilities or other expenses outside of rent

&amp;#x200B;

My current monthly budget is as follows:

&amp;#x200B;

|Student Loan 1|*71.03* |**Current Amount: $2632 @ 11.500%**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Student Loan 2**|*61.04*|**Current Amount: $4962.57 @ 5%**|
|**Student Loan 3** |*87.98*|**Current Amount: $29270 @ varying interest rates since it is a collection of loans as one**|
|**Car Payment**|*200*|**Current Amount: $7000 @ 5%**|
|**Mother Payment**|*180*|**Includes parent plus loan and cell phone**|

|**Crunchy Roll**|*5.99*||
|**Total:** |*1060.82*||
|**Monthly savings after expenses**|*1166.35*||

I am salaried and paid on a monthly basis. Unfortunately, I only have $2900 in my account as I had to pay for 5k car repair out of pocket. I currently have a credit card with a 9k limit with 0% APR until May 2020.

personalfinance,"I have a pretty low interest rate on my $30k of student loans - should I pay them off as fast as I can, or invest?","Details: I graduated college in 2017, currently making $65k a year and have been paying $500/month on a 20 year plan with a $277/month minimum. The interest rate is 4.125% and I currently have around $30k left to pay.

I'm trying to decide if it makes more sense to just pay the minimum every month and put the difference towards investing (which I know isn't a ton but still).

I was planning on doing 15y loan for two reasons  first, the interest rate of the 15y is lower and after the 15y, then I would be free and clear.  This would allow for me to invest the old “payment” funds into something else.

In the other thread, someone mentioned that a 30y loan would be a better option because even though the interest rate is slightly higher, it is still “cheap” money which will let you use the cheap money for a longer period of time.

I would like some input on this.  
Basic numbers just for assumptions:

$650k 
30y 4.25%
15y 3.8%

personalfinance,Alliant is calculating interest incorrectly,"I did some math recently and found that Alliant CU appears to be calculating interest on my savings account using the formula for simple interest rather than compound interest. This is the formula multiple reps have told me by email they use to calculate my interest:

&gt;Average daily balance x rate (2.080%) divided by 365 x number of days in the month. That will give the interest amount for that month.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The formula used to calculate interest is Average daily balance x rate (2.080%) divided by 365 x number of days in the month.

&amp;#x200B;

Their [website](https://www.alliantcreditunion.org/money-mentor/how-does-annual-percentage-yield-apy-work) says they compound monthly, so by that logic, the formula used to calculate my end of month balance should be A = P (1 + r / n)^(nt)

&amp;#x200B;

Where:

* A = the end of month balance, including interest
* P = the principal amount (in this case the starting balance/avg daily balance, since I make no new deposits to this account)
* r = the annual interest rate as a decimal
* n = the number of times that interest is compounded per unit t (i.e. 12)
* t = the amount of time for which the interest is compounded, expressed in years

As the title says i'm in my mid 20's and I desperately need some guidance on my financial situation. For context I am married with a son, single income, make about $75k a year. 

I recently had some hospital bills come in while I was between jobs and my previous employer never offered cobra insurance to me, however when I contacted them about the hospital visit they wanted me to pay them $4000 just for the coverage and they would date it back. The hospital bills are roughly $3000. 

I'm starting to fall behind with payments on credit cards and vehicles, and I made very poor financial decisions in my life, but I really want to turn them around for my family. I  have about $10k in credit card debts. My vehicles I have a SUV which is 0.6% interest I got when I had good credit, $590/mo. I want to refinance so bad, but I will never get this interest rate today. I also have a truck which is $630/mo which was a terrible impulse buy. 

I really want to get rid of the truck to lessen the burden there with monthly payments, but I don't know how to go forward. I'm falling behind on my payments and getting really stressed with my money situation, I'm about 2 payments behind on each vehicle and trying to catch up before anything worse happens. 

My credit score has tanked to about 530 on experian, and I really want to improve it. I'm looking for any kind of advice about my situation and what I can do to better it. I've tried budgeting before but I have such a hard time doing the excel sheets and keeping up with editing them. Maybe there is a better way? 

I want my 5 year plan to be debt free and financially stable, but I need some advice and help getting there. The truck loan is only a year and a half old and I really don't have a need for the vehicle since it guzzles gasoline down, I used it when I first got it tons, but those needs have since passed and I would be much better off with a small car.

personalfinance,"I opened a Citi Savings Account, and I think I need a new savings account.","TL;DR: Citi Savings has been a big, heaping mess for me, and I don't trust them with my money. Is there a bank that I can trust AND get good interest?

&amp;#x200B;

I have the Citi through Costco and have had really fantastic interactions with customer service.

&amp;#x200B;

One time, I called the price rewind line to tell them I got a full refund on an item that I also got an $80 rewind on and they had me mail a check. They returned it saying I didn't write it correctly (I wrote it to instructions of the call center). When I called them again, they told me to forget it then and keep the $80 rewind as a thank you for being their customer. *Every* interaction I've had with the credit card side of things has been like this, where they take care of me, no questions asked.

&amp;#x200B;

So, when I saw Citi had 2.36% on savings in my state (Colorado), I figured I'd open an account and move my savings getting \~1% over. Of course, to open the account you set up an initial transfer, and, to set-up your online account *and* the transfer, you verify the external account. I did.

The funds weren't transferring after a couple of weeks, so I contacted Citi. They told me the transfer didn't exist and my CU must have rejected it (!?). They also told me the account I added to set up the transfer isn't added permanently and I'd need to add it, verify it, and set up the transfer once more.

&amp;#x200B;

uh, ok.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, that's around the time I discovered the transfer was, indeed, there, but pending. I'm patient and flaky, I can wait.

&amp;#x200B;

Today, I finally bothered to log in and verify my CU *again*. The transfer is *still* pending. I have no way to cancel it or interact with it at all. It's a huge pain, too, because the site is really weird and the links don't always link to the same page...? I called and the T2 I was transferred to even admitted the site does this.

&amp;#x200B;

The transfer is showing it's pending and was initiated 4/10. It does not react to his script, there is no ""selecting"" it, and it is not a future transfer either.

&amp;#x200B;

He can't figure out what's going on, so we wait 20 minutes on hold to get to an ""online account specialist."" She does *not* speak English. She's trying her damndest, but she just sounds condescending.

&amp;#x200B;

I tried to explain why I had to verify my CU twice and she keeps pausing with an ""MMMMMM. No. You do not need to verify again. Do not verify again. Stop verifying it."" I eventually gave up and said OK.

&amp;#x200B;

After putting me on hold twice, she concludes the system had asked me to verify my account again (!?), that's why, because of a security issue, so now that I have verified it again, it will go through in 24-48 hours. She also mentioned some gibberish about how I need to initiate it through my CU or something. I don't know. But she has concluded this has all happened for my security.

&amp;#x200B;

I had a bad feeling about this the second I originally verified my account and tried to use their awful website, and now I'm feeling like I've been let off easy. I'm planning to cancel the account shortly.

&amp;#x200B;

I originally wanted to set up a Marcus by Goldman Sachs account, but I saw a lot of reviews from people struggling to transfer money out.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm wondering if anyone has any suggestions for me. I'd love to go to a local CU, but they obviously don't have great interest rates and I already filled up those sweet PMCU money markets.

tron,Why does Quorra say reintegration with CLU would be something Flynn would never survive??,"So I’ve watched Tron: Legacy yet again and I still have absolutely no idea why reintegration with CLU would be something Flynn would “never survive”. I’ve never understood that concept and nowhere on the Internet is it fully explained why. It just seems to be a movie plot point that is never explained. 

Are Flynn and CLU both two parts of one whole and because CLU grew so powerful that being rejoined with Flynn would upset the balance of the two once they’re recombined?  Or is Flynn too old and frail to survive such an event?  The guy might well be a god (CLU refers to him as a “false deity” in his invasion speech) on the Grid for all we’ve seen so if this is the case, why would reintegration price fatal??

Also, Quorra says that CLU “fed on [Flynn’s] resistance” so what exactly does that mean?  Did CLU actually gain more power by defeating Flynn’s forces and/or by killing the ISOs?

I put myself into this situation by losing a few grand trying to start up an eCommerce business, and also mostly due to gambling, which I have now realized I had a problem, realized the terrible financial situation I put myself in due to gambling, and not even going near it for a very long time.

# Monthly Dues

* $310/month for my car loan ($16,899 remaining, 5.69% interest rate, last refinanced July 2018, current FICO is 742, current loan is through Navy Federal CU)
* $293/month for car insurance (shopping for cheaper at end of premium).

* $21.98/month for OS Runescape membership (I know this can go, but it helps ease my anxiety and I'd prefer my mental health being greater than financial health currently.)
* $6.57/month for Amazon prime subscription
* **Total: $642.49/month**

# Income

For my income, I do Shipt which is basically Uber Eats but for grocery stores and I shop and deliver a customers groceries. I make my own hours which I try to be on schedule for 40-50 hours a week, however with summer coming up (slowest time for us) and also recent mass hirings they've done, my income has dropped from what it used to be. So far this year, on average, **I make $502/week untaxed**. Get around half the orders I used to, when I would make $750-$1,100 a week. This is also due to me only shopping one zone now compared to me doing a total of 5 zones, but now with this financial spot I'm in, I went back to a total of 4 zones. Just wanted you guys to understand my job, however if there is any other side jobs that pay well that I can do online/similar to Shipt where I make my own schedule, I'm highly interested for a temporary larger income.

# Credit Cards w/ Debt

I believe I did the right thing a few weeks back and opened an AMEX EveryDay Card for a balance transfer card, got a $7,500 CL on it with a $5,000 balance transfer maximum (AMEX rules), put $5,000 on it from other card and then made $2,200 in purchases (Advertisement spend for eCommerce business).

* **Card 1**: *NFCU GoRewards Visa:* $3,000 CL | Due on 12th of every month | $2,185.75 current balance | 13.24% APR
* **Card 2:** *NFCU CashRewards Visa:* $25,000 CL | Due on 21st of every month | $3,957.12 current balance | 13.24% APR
* **Card 3:** *AMEX Everyday:* $7,500 CL | Due on 18th of every month | $7,304.03 current balance | 0% APR until Aug 2020 | With this card I plan on just paying minimum payments until the APR kicks in in August 24, 2020 which is a whopping 24.24%, then going to pay in full.

# Conclusion

I realize the mistakes I made, mostly with gambling, and woke up and I've stopped. Gambling money you don't have was an absolute terrible mistake and I'm glad I was able to come to the realization to stop, albeit too late. I owe around $450 in estimated tax for the 2nd quarter of 2019 on June 17 (Can probably skip and take late fees) for my 1099 for my job, **however don't know if that money is better towards the debt for interest fees vs late fees for tax**. I'm still trying to make my eCommerce business work, but I am going to be giving it one final shot before shutting it down and causing myself to be going more into debt.

# Plan

After 60 days of my AMEX card being open, I can apply for a CL increase. I will do that as soon as I can, and if I get accepted, make all purchases up until the CL hit on the AMEX EveryDay card due to 0% APR until August 24, 2020. Either way if I get denied/accepted, I will pay off in bits and pieces when possible on the NFCU cards, then not pay anything off other then minimum payments on the AMEX card until August 2020, then pay it off in full so I don't have to deal with the insane APR.

**Now my questions to you all is this:**

* Am I doing this right? Is there anything I'm missing and I am accepting any and all advice in how to get out of this debt.
* Is it better taking out a personal loan to pay off the debt? Also is the app ""Tally"" worth trying or is that a huge scam.
* Finally, is it better to skip the June 17, September 16, and January 15 due dates for my 1099 of EST tax, or is that going to be a larger late fee penalty then the interest I accrue from my credit cards.

# TLDR

$13,149 in CC debt due to eCommerce business and gambling, $642 in monthly dues because I still live at home, average around $500/week in income (Pay varies as I make my own schedule and each hour I'm on, not guaranteed orders.) $7,300 of it is in a 0% APR balance transfer card and the rest on 2 cards, both with 13.24% APR. Not sure if there is any other ways of tackling this debt faster when it comes to loans or anything, and need any help and advice I can get.

investing,Cyclical v Non-Cyclical stocks (software?),"Cyclical Stocks 

Cyclical stocks follow an upward turn in the business cycle when businesses and consumers are spending money.  Automobile companies are classic cyclical stocks. When the economy is good, and people are working, car sales do well. However, if there are layoffs and uncertainty or high-interest rates, people may decide to hold on to their car another year.  Businesses expand during good times. They buy new equipment and build new facilities, so equipment sales and construction are cyclical stocks.  When the economy cools, businesses run down inventory, put off expansions, and delay purchases. Cyclical stocks such as steel manufacturing and sales suffer when business slows down. 

&amp;#x200B;

Non-Cyclical Stocks

Non-Cyclical Stocks or defensive stocks do well in economic downturns since demand for their products and services continues regardless of the economy.  The classic example of non-cyclical stocks is utilities. Everyone from consumers to businesses needs water, gas, and electricity. When the economy is growing, these stocks tend to lag behind, however during economic downturns; their steady returns may look good.  Another classic example of non-cyclical stocks is household non-durable goods, such as toothpaste, toilet paper, cleaning materials.

cybersecurity,Government vs Private Sector,"Hey everyone, I'm looking for some advice as I'll be approaching the start of my senior year of college.  I'm currently interning at a large utilities company for the summer, and I informally received a full-time offer from them as a SOC analyst for when I graduate.  I should point out that this company is within commuting distance from my house, so I'd be able to live at home for a couple of years and pay off my student loans without much issue.  I recognize that I am pretty lucky to be given an entry-level offer because from what I've seen, it's pretty tough without prior experience (and I have none).  However, my goal has always been to work in the federal government, specifically the Intelligence Community (IC).  Due to some more luck, I have two conditional job offers (D.C. area) from two separate agencies in the IC, which are dependent on me getting my security clearance.  I have a pretty clean background with no foreign travel/contacts, so I should be fine with getting the clearance, but you really never know for sure.  Here are where my thoughts currently are:

**Government**

* Better retirement benefits
* Slightly better starting salary (though I'd be living in D.C.)
* Top secret clearance/experience would open the door for a multitude of opportunities down the line
* Has been my goal of mine for past several years to be involved with national security

**Utilities Company**

* Close to home
* More ""comfortable"" since I'm working there this summer
* Save money living at home for a few years
* Guaranteed, whereas with government, it is dependent on a security clearance

I've been told that an IC cyber job with a top secret security clearance would pretty much set me up going forward and that I'd be able to go almost anywhere if I'm looking to move into the private sector.  Is this accurate?  Or am I overvaluing a government job?  What advice do you have for me as I'm weighing these options?

Longtime lurker, first time posting.

Simply wondering if anyone has been in a similar position or any other options I may have. I filed my taxes on the above date with a family member who uses TurboTax. I provided them with all documents from W2, pension plan, student loan interests, and for the first time this year I claimed my daughter (born October 2018). I also claimed the health tax credit, which I then needed to mail in a form to the IRS (confirmed received).

I’d been doing my taxes myself for a while, but the addition of claiming a dependent and pension plan this year made me want to seek someone with a bit more experience. Needless to say, I’ve YET to receive my federal return three-plus months later. My state return was received last week. 

I have called and spoken to a live agent 3 times and each time they have said everything looks good. Last week, the agent said it was a system error that needed to be rectified and that I should see my tax return in 2-3 weeks— except the time before that the agent said the same thing sans the system error part (that time it was the health tax credit form that needed to be received). I am reportedly not missing any documentation.

I am at a loss. I haven’t owed taxes, ever. Any ideas, suggestions? Is it possible I just never see this return? Thanks a ton in advance!

personalfinance,New (likely) for 529 plans: student loan payments. Consider making a contribution to maximize state tax benefits.,"As part of lawmakers’ attempts to reform retirement tax provisions, the House of Representatives overwhelmingly (417-3) passed the SECURE Act last week. Included in that bill, which now goes to the Senate for deliberations, is a provision that amends the use of 529 tuition plans.

The new bill allows each individual beneficiary to use from their 529 account a lifetime total of $10,000 toward qualified student loan payments. 

**Why this matters**

Ignoring any federal tax benefits of 529 plans (non-taxed investment gains), contributions to a 529 plan are often tax deductible for state income tax purposes. For example, my home state of Michigan provides a max $5,000 deduction for a contribution, equal to a $212.50 tax reduction (4.25% tax rate) per year, or $425 total for a full $10,000 amount.

Because of the SECURE Act, individuals with student loans will be able to use 529 amounts to pay off student loans, making the contributions very useful for state tax purposes.

Using New York as another example, the state offers a max $5,000 deduction per year, and assuming a 6.33% tax rate, the tax benefit for two years ($5,000 each year, $10,000 max) is $633.

**Pitfalls**

According to the new provision, any amount of money used to pay off student loans from a 529 account must reduce dollar-for-dollar the deduction for student loan interest. Depending on the type of loan you have (federal subsidized, unsubsidized, etc.), you may be making payments toward a significant amount of interest, and the deduction for student loan interest may, subject to various limitations, be better to take on your federal tax return rather than getting a state tax benefit for the contribution and subsequently withdrawing the money to pay off your student loan.

You will want to evaluate your particular tax and loan situation and determine which option is more tax beneficial for you. Additionally, you will want to research whether your state *even permits* a deduction for 529 plan contributions. Either way, you want to maximize the tax benefit you receive from paying off your student loans!",finance

worldpolitics,Another dead lock of Japan,"Looking back at the United States, Japan joined the sanctions against Russia, in spite of the connections developed over the years in the economic, industrial and cultural sectors. The sanctions imposed against Russia had a strong effect on the cooperation of Russian and Japanese politicians, and the business.

However, the Japanese leadership notes that the country depends on the United States for security issues, and the country's government has to rely on American military support due to tensions with China, North Korea and South Korea. In this regard, Japan was forced to impose sanctions against Russia.

Japan is forgetting that Russia now is trying hard to gain trust between the two countries by taking a step forward and creating conditions for visiting historical burial sites in the Kuril Islands. Russian President Vladimir Putin agrees to sign a peace treaty with Japan on the conditions that will be acceptable to both parties. However, at the same time, Japan joins American sanctions against the Russian Federation, which, of course, does not fit into the understanding of the formation of a qualitatively new level of relations, which Prime Minister S. Abe is talking about.

It is worth recalling that in response to the proposal to conclude the peace treaty between the two countries, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said that he considered that unacceptable for his country without solving the territorial problem, and would like to sign it on his own terms, i.e. after the Russian Kuril Islands were annexed to Japan. But Japan has already joined the sanctions, declaring its disagreement with Russian policy towards Ukraine, with the annexation of the Crimea. It is unlikely that these actions of the Japanese leadership will contribute to the development of good-neighborly relations between the two countries and the signing of the peace treaty, especially on the conditions of the Japanese side. 

As for the sanctions, it is undoubtedly a double-edged weapon, it causes discomfort to the Russian Federation, but it also damages the countries that play these sanctions games, including Japan. This is the Japanese economy suffering from sanctions, for example, the automotive industry, which is faced with a lack of supplies of Russian aluminum. And this is the natural unwillingness of the Russian authorities to sign the peace treaty on Japanese terms to solve territorial problems. 

Therefore, the use of such sanctions will inevitably entail negative consequences not only for Russia. The policy of «silent consent» of Shinzo Abe in relations with the United States, as a result of which Japan joined the anti-Russian sanctions regime, led to the actual loss for Japan of the prospect of solving Japan’s territorial contradictions with Russia based on Japanese positions. Thus, by introducing anti-Russian sanctions, in the wake of the United States, Japan itself is driving itself to a dead lock.",finance
personalfinance,PSA: The annual interest rate for a loan is often NOT the ''return'' you get for repaying that loan early.,[removed],finance
personalfinance,The annual interest rate for a loan is NOT the same thing as the ''return'' you get for repaying that loan early (math inside).,"Hi there -- let's do some loan math!

#Introduction

While browsing the many posts asking advice about loan repayment, I've noticed a number of comments appearing to **assume** (implicitly or explicitly) that the **return** the borrower would achieve by paying off a loan is **the same** as the loan's annual interest rate.  ***In general, this assumption is incorrect.***

##Goals

This post has two goals.

1. Provide several reasonable definitions of **return** in the context of loan repayment.

2. Provide concrete examples for which the above assumption fails for **every** definition.

##Simplifying Assumptions

Here are some simplifying assumptions in the background of this discussion.

* Only costs due to payments are considered (ie, we are ignoring fees, credit score and tax implications, etc.).

* Each loan has a fixed annual interest rate, no outstanding interest, and is not eligible for forgiveness (a ""standard"" loan).

* The same, fixed payment is made each month (with the possible exception of the final month of repayment).

* I'll use the 30/360 rule for interest calculations, and round displayed currency values to the nearest dollar.

---

#Background definitions

Let's start with some background definitions.

&amp;nbsp;

####Monthly investment

* Your **monthly investment** is the amount you pay each month in excess of the minimum payment.

* If your minimum payment is $100, and you pay $250 towards the loan each month, your monthly investment is `$150 = $250 - $100`.

* This definition makes sense: that excess money is an investment because you're *choosing* to apply it toward loan repayment, with the hope of some long-term benefit (saving money on interest charges).

&amp;nbsp;

####Total lifetime investment

* Your **total lifetime investment** is the sum of your monthly investments, until the loan is repaid.

&amp;nbsp;

####Maximum total lifetime cost

* The **maximum total lifetime cost** of a loan is the cost of the loan when paying only the minimum payment each month.

&amp;nbsp;

####Total lifetime savings

* The **total lifetime savings** of your repayment method is the difference,

  &gt; ( lifetime cost using your repayment method ) - ( maximum total lifetime cost ).

* Notice that, in order to calculate these savings, you **must** specify the minimum monthly payment (otherwise, there is no comparison to be made, and no savings to be calculated).

---

#Possible definitions of ''return''

Below are some reasonable candidates that might serve to define the ''return'' from early loan repayment.

###Return on Investment (ROI)

* Expressed as a percent, the **ROI** of your repayment method is the quantity,

  &gt; 100% * ( total lifetime savings ) / ( total lifetime investment ).

* Note that the ROI is defined this way because **the (absolute) return for loan repayment is the savings you achieve** by repaying early and avoiding interest charges.

&amp;nbsp;

###Rate of Return (ROR)

* Expressed as a percent per year, the average annual **ROR** of your repayment method is the quotient,

  &gt; ( ROI ) / ( number of years required to repay the loan ).


&amp;nbsp;

###Equivalent Compound Annual Growth Rate (ECAGR)

* The **ECAGR** of your repayment method is

  &gt; the year-over-year (that is, compounded), annual growth rate required to achieve absolute growth equal to your total lifetime savings, over the repayment term of the loan, using the same pattern of investment as your loan repayment.

* In other words, if, instead of investing in loan repayment, you invested the **same amount of money**, at the **same time**, in a fund getting a fixed, compounded annual growth rate equal to your repayment ECAGR, you'd end up **gaining** exactly as much as you **save** with loan repayment.

* In general, this quantity is not straightforward to calculate, as the investments in loan repayment are ''staggered'' in the sense that additional money is invested each month.  (But we'll take a look at a special case.)

&amp;nbsp;

I also define each of these quantities to be 0 when paying only the minimum monthly payment.

&amp;nbsp;


***If you think another definition better captures the concept of ''return'' in this context, please share it in a comment!***

---

#Examples

Let's look at some examples to see how different the ROI, ROR, and ECAGR can be from the loan's annual interest rate.  (All principals and annual interest rates were taken or approximated from recent posts right here on r/personalfinance.)

##Example 1

You borrow $30k with a 2% annual interest rate and a $150 minimum monthly payment.

&amp;nbsp;

Monthly Payment ($) | Savings ($) | Investment ($) | ROI (%) | ROR (% / year) | ECAGR (% / year)
--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:
150 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0
250 | 3,023 | 13,399 | 22.6 | 2.0 | 1.7
300 | 3,677 | 16,350 | 22.5 | 2.5 | 2.0
500 | 4,887 | 22,050 | 22.2 | 4.2 | 3.3
750 | 5,449 | 24,773 | 22.0 | 6.3 | 5.0
1,000 | 5,720 | 26,152 | 21.9 | 8.5 | 6.6
30,050 | 6,472 | 29,900 | 21.6 | 259.8 | 950.0

&amp;nbsp;

* Let's talk about the elephant in the room: the last row of the table.  **Surely there's a mistake there, right?**  ***Nope.***
  * The last row of the table corresponds to repaying the loan with a lump sum.  This means the loan is paid off in 1 month.
  * Since `( ROR ) = ( ROI ) / ( years to repay )`, and `( years to repay ) = ( 1 / 12 )` here, we have `( ROR ) = ( ROI ) * 12` for this row.
  * For the ECAGR, consider that **we've achieved about a 21.6% ROI in one month**.  That means we've multiplied our initial investment by `1.216` in a month.  If we were to do that for a full year, we'd multiply our initial investment by `( 1.216 )^( 12 ) = 10.45`.  This is a *growth* of about `9.45` times our initial investment, or `945%`, consistent with the table (some rounding has been done).
  * Due to the staggered investments when repayment is not done with a lump sum, the other rows of the ECAGR are more difficult to compute, but the same intuition applies.

##Example 2

You borrow $10k with a 7.5% annual interest rate and a $100 minimum monthly payment.

&amp;nbsp;

Monthly Payment ($) | Savings ($) | Investment ($) | ROI (%) | ROR (% / year) | ECAGR (% / year)
--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:
100 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0
150 | 2,766 | 4,300 | 64.3 | 8.9 | 6.3
500 | 5,026 | 8,516 | 59.0 | 32.2 | 24.9
1,000 | 5,383 | 9,259 | 58.1 | 63.4 | 64.9
10,063 | 5,680 | 9,963 | 57.0 | 684.2 | 22,349.0

&amp;nbsp;

* As before, all three definitions of **return** can be ***much*** higher than the loan's annual interest rate.
* Also, note that, without knowledge of **both** the *minimum monthly payment* **and** the monthly payment *actually applied* toward the loan, it's **impossible** to calculate these quantities.  (By definition, we must make a comparison between two different costs, one of which must come from the minimum monthly payment.)

##Example 3

You borrow $15k with an 18% annual interest rate and a $350 minimum monthly payment.

&amp;nbsp;

Monthly Payment ($) | Savings ($) | Investment ($) | ROI (%) | ROR (% / year) | ECAGR (% / year)
--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:
350 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0
500 | 4,128 | 6,000 | 68.8 | 20.1 | 13.7
750 | 6,238 | 9,567 | 65.2 | 32.6 | 27.2
1,000 | 7,084 | 11,050 | 64.1 | 42.7 | 26.8
15,225 | 8,980 | 14,875 | 60.4 | 724.4 | 28,831.2

&amp;nbsp;

* There's nothing new here: it would still be a mathematical crime to approximate most of these numbers with the debt's annual interest rate.

---

#Summary / TL;DR

1. Early loan repayment can result in a ''return'' ***much, much*** higher than the loan's annual interest rate.
2. When giving mathematical advice involving loan repayment, **always** take into account **both** the minimum monthly payment **and** the monthly payment *actually applied* toward the loan.  *Otherwise, make it clear that you're simply guessing!*
 * **Alternatively, consider giving conditional advice**, such as, ""I would only pay this off if you can get more than a Y% ECAGR, because that's what I'd expect you to get with the other investment you're considering; let's wait for someone to calculate the ECAGR for us.""

&amp;nbsp;

Of course, the analysis becomes more difficult with increasing complexity (such as multiple loans, outstanding interest, interest capitalization, and loan forgiveness), but that only makes it **more** important to sit down and do the math before making a recommendation.  (And yes, those cases can **all** be analyzed similarly!)

I'm planning to buy a car on an auto loan shortly. I plan to have the car in my and my spouse's name. I'm also tentatively thinking of buying home on a mortgage loan in next 6m. I needed advice on:

1. Should we get the car on loan co-signed by both me and my spouse, or just one of us? If it is one of us, should the one with higher credit score get the loan or lower? (both of us have good credit scores, my spouse has better than me, I have higher income)
2. Assuming that the mortgage would be needed to be signed by both me and my spouse together (given the potential high loan amount), how does the rate get decided? I understand our combined income matters, but do they look at the higher credit score or the lower credit score or the average?

My thinking is that if one of us can alone afford to take the auto loan (which will lead to a hard query), we should do it so that only of us gets a reduced credit score. Question is should the individual with lower credit score get it further lowered, or should the person with higher credit score get it lowered, in order to ultimately optimize for a lower interest rate for the home loan?

personalfinance,Supporting myself with a line of credit through medical school?,"Hello,

I currently live at home and I have never lived on my own before. I will be starting medical school in the fall and I am considering moving out. While I don’t have to move out in order to attend, I live very far from campus and I would be saving a massive amount of time if I lived in the city by campus.

As a medical student, with the exception of about 4 month (including christmas) over the next 4 years, I will not be able to work because of school. So if I were to move out, I would essentially have the money in my bank account and any other funding I manage to raise.

While looking into the options, I’ve come across medical student lines of credit. While the exact details differ between banks, all of the options are essentially the same:

- $300,000 credit limit

- annual interest rate of prime-0.25%

- interest-only payments until 2 years after graduation (or until after completion of residency with some banks).

I don’t have to worry about tuition, and assuming the prime rate doesn’t triple in the near future, I have enough money to cover interest payments. Also, as a medical resident in 4 years time, I will be guarenteed a salary of between 46,000 and 63,000, rising anually by 5,000-10,000 until the end of my residency. I am also able to apply for bursaries and scholarships at my university which can be used as additionally income if awarded to me, but they are not a certainty. Rent in my area is between 700-1200 for the type of apprentment I am looking for, ideally on the lower end.

I made some basic projections looking at different prime rates and monthly budgets, and to me it seems reasonable, but then again, I’ve never lived alone before, so I don’t really know. 

So, if you were in my situation, would you feel secure in opening that line of credit?

His reasoning is that I am taking too long to graduate. He has told me I am welcome to stay home rent free but I have to get a job. I am really set on going back to school as I fear that if I stay home it will become a permanent thing and I fear that I may never finish school. 

I have no idea what to do.

I currently have no money at all to my name. I have a job lined up for summer where housing and food is provided. I have already been hired and I would work about 7 weeks for a total of around $3000. The thing is the job is an 8 hour drive away and starts mid June. I don't have money to get down there and on top of that I have to spend about $100 to get CPR certified for the job. My girlfriend who lives only an hour away from the job site who also got the job is willing to come and get me and bring me back down just so I can work there. However she doesn't have money either and I would need to pay for gas. Currently my plan is to take out a credit card (I have really good credit as the rent, bills, and credit card statements of the past four years have been under my name even though my dad was the one paying for it) and pay for my way to the job and then pay off the card with my first paycheck. After that is done, then there's the matter of finding myself a place at the city of my school. Right now I am applying for FAFSA but have never been approved due to my dad's income being too high. I need some sort of aid to get me through this coming academic year. If I get denied for FAFSA again then I might go ahead and take out a loan to finish school. As of right now I have 3 semesters of school before I graduate. If I overload my schedule then I might be able to bring that down to 2 semesters but that would mean I absolutely could not work a part-time job. 

Honestly, I am open to any and all suggestions because I'm kind of lost.",finance

personalfinance,Are my calculations correct for student loan repayment? (UK-but more of a maths question),"So in the UK, we have a loan system where you borrow tuition and maintenance loans and there is a roughly 6% interest rate on the loan which starts the moment you get it, before you graduate.

Assuming most fees are £9250 a year and the maximum loan you can for maintenance is £8700,  totaling £17950, with interest goes up to £19027, and then add another set of loans for 2nd year and 3rd and with interest it goes to £60574.36 that one would come out of university with.

6% of that is £3634.46, and our loan repayment system is 9% of our income above £26,575. So I am correct in thinking, for you to actually be paying off the loan, you'd need to be earning an amount so that 9% of your salary is above the interest rate.

So in this scenario if someone is paying off £3634.46 a year of the loan, it would mean they are earning £40,382.89 above £26,575 which is £67139.89 for them to ever actually feasibly pay off the loan right, which is well above triple the average graduate starting salary, making this loan effectively impossible to pay off?",finance

personalfinance,"SEP IRA, 401k, reducing 1099 burden","I did one 1099 job earlier this year and earned 12k that was just paid.  
I have a salary job now that wasn't available then it offers a non-matching 401k (this may end up being matching in the future).  
I want to reduce the tax burden I pay on the 12k that was self-employment 1099 work. As I understand this, the tax burden is higher due to 1099 work (fica pays twice).  


Can contributing 25% to a SEP IRA later on this year reduce the base that I pay taxes on to 9k instead of 12k? Seems like at a 40% tax rate (combined, fed, state, and city is very close to this for me where I live) I would save 1200 this way.  


Could I contribute to my own 401k as well to reduce this tax burden?   


Could I also contribute to my company's 401k too?

Is the maximum for the SEP defined by my 1099 income (which was under myself, not a greater company) or by my 1099+personal income from the salary position?

personalfinance,Advice for Grad school loans/options vs. that given to me by financial advisor,"Throwaway for obvious reasons, I’m going to try to keep this short, sweet, and to the point. 

I’m a 29yr old grad student, 8 months into a 32-month full-time (year-round, not allowed to work during it) program. The first 8 months of my program is more “credit heavy” and bares 50% of the cost of the entire program, so I’ve made a good-sized dent in my savings. My question is pertaining to what my next step should be as my cash dwindles down. My expected graduation date is May 2021, and I can expect to make a minimum of $150k/year, more likely ~$170k/year out of school.

Current financials: $20k cash + $23k in Apple and Amazon stock + $34k of FAFSA money I will get paid out via $6,833 each semester (unsubsidized @ 6.6% interest) = $77k - $4k (15% capital gains tax on my stocks) = ~$73k total for the next 24 months of school.

I also have $43k in a 401k hosted via Fidelity from my former job.

Between school costs, and cost of living for next 24 months, I estimate that on the high end I will need an additional $40-50k on top of the ~$73k I currently have… so now to my current options/question…

Option 1: One my cash reserves get low, I can take out more loans through the government via Direct PLUS loans. These are guaranteed for whatever amount I would need, unsubsidized at a 7.6% interest rate. This is what other students in my program have done that I have spoken too, and is what the internet seems to tell me to do.

Option 2: My savings and stocks above are hosted via Ameriprise financial which is who my Moms financial advisor works for. My Moms financial advisor recommends that because of how high the Student PLUS interest rate is (7.6%), that I roll over my 401k into an IRA (hosted by Ameriprise), that I can then withdraw from as needed for school (I'm not 100% sure how this works). She states that taking from my retirement funds would be beneficial because of 1. The high interest rate on loans and 2. I will be able to max out my retirement funds once I graduate d/t my expected post-school salary (I voiced my concern as I have heard/read on the internet to not touch retirement funds).

Option 2.5: Roll over my 401k to an IRA… but still take out Direct PLUS loans.

Option 3: Take out private loans that may have a lower interest rate (my credit score is &gt;770). I have heard horror stories of students rates going up after X amount of time, and in general have anecdotally heard negative things about this route.

Option 4: Reddit?

personalfinance,Need work down on my parents house. Vendor does not accept credit. What are my options?,"Hello all,

My parents need some ""landscaping"" done. there is some water damage under the patio concrete and a brick wall is being loosely supported after a mudslide. The idea is to break up the concrete with proper drainage and build a retaining wall to help support the brick wall that is at risk of falling over.

Now my parents can't afford this as they just took out a loan to get the roof roofed (heh). I have no debt, and about $5k in savings. I did all the research and collected quotes and have one for $11k to do the leveling, concrete and wall work. The vendor asked for a check and I said I haven't used checks in awhile can I pay credit? He gave me his ""business"" chase debit card and I wrote down his info (with no idea what to do with it because it's not like zello or paypal but I figured it couldn't hurt)

If I can not pay it with my credit card like a invoice I am more accustomed to then I was thinking of a cash advance or a small personal loan of $11,000. What would be the best choice?

I make about $1,900 a paycheck, and have no credit card or student loan debt. Although this is partially cosmetic, if it does not get resolved soon, it could end up costing a lot more.

personalfinance,Figure out taxes on ESPP?,"I tried reading some threads but most of them are somewhat vague as to not wanting to pay taxes or less taxes.

My question is really about how I can get a rough estimate on how much tax I will need to pay.

About my plan:

- 15% discount locked in for 3 years (most recent lock in period started January 3rd, 2019)
- Buy happens every 6 months (is always 15% less the lock-in or current market value whichever is lower)

From my understanding there are 3 parts to all of this:

- Purchase from paycheck
- Benefit (what work pays for discount)
- Gain (extra money made at time of sale)

There are two basic scenarios in my head:

- I sell right away; pay normal income tax on all the money
- I hold for 2 years from start of each period; pay normal income tax on stock purchase/benefit but only pay 15% long term capital gains on profit

Am I thinking of this correctly?

Example (made up numbers):
Taxable income is $100,000 and $20,000 goes in to ESPP. It become $26,000 based on lock-in and discount. I sell right away and thus pay income tax on $126,000 or 24% to federal. I personally hold aside $1440 to cover the $6000 in stock profit/discount and work puts the full $100,000 (inclusive of the $20,000) on my W2.

Clarification if needed: My company stock has been on a steady climb so there is additional capital gain right out of the gate at each buy period since my 15% is based on an old lock-in date.",finance
personalfinance,401k... to cash out or not to cash out?,"Hello Reddit Family! 

My wife has a 401K from a job she had more than 10 years ago. It's just been sitting there.. no contributions made. She had a pretty good setup at this job and the company contributed very generously to it. Over the 6 years she worked there, she contributed about $5k and they laid her off back in 2007.

The 401K has been growing. It currently has a balance of about $55k. We accumulated some debt after some unforeseen expenses required for our home in the total amount of about $20k. This debt currently has an interest rate of around 6% for 10 years (HELOC current prime rate + .5%).

We are toying around with the idea of cashing out the 401K and paying off the debt. Our bank says that we would take home about $35k after fees and taxes (including income tax). For only contributing $5k, a $30k return on investment is pretty good in my opinion, however, I understand this would be more if we waited another 15 years to be ""of age"" to access the retirement funds in full. 

So, question is... are we better off paying the interest and continue paying about $500/mo towards the debt? Or cashing out the 401K, eliminating the debt, and putting that $500/mo towards our savings? (we would also net another $15k cash for reinvestment)

solar,Got a quote for Solar + Tesla Powerwalls. Looking for some guidance.,"Been wanting to get solar since I built my house but I always felt it was too expensive vs just buying electric. Been reading up on newer panel efficiency and decided to get a quote. 

&amp;#x200B;

First a little about my house. It is about 3000 square feet, I have an electric car and use about 73kWh per day (yearly average). I have also been looking into a whole home generator so this would be to replace that. I am in North East Florida. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was quoted 22 SunPower panels. The quote states that it would generate 68% of my electricity so I would still be buying from Electric company. I also added 2 Tesla Powerwalls providing 27 kWh of storage. Total was about $50K (before tax credit) and comes to $2.80/Watt after Federal Tax Credit (I assume this $2.80 includes the \~$14k for 2 powerwalls). Financing this and estimating what I would be paying per month to electric company, this system would cost me about $100 more then what I paying for electric now.

personalfinance,I want to retire early. Should I try to pay off my mortgage or invest a bunch of my income?,"Edit:  I've been playing piano for about 35 years and it's something that I do at a very serious level.  The piano I bought is absolutely top of the line (it's a Shigeru SK6 in case anyone knows about pianos) and is easily the finest instrument in its size category that I've ever played.  Given that it's very high-end and rather uncommon (more Lamborghinis are produced per year than Shigeru pianos) it is likely to hold its value pretty well for a long time.  Selling it is not an option.  


Current debt:mortgage: $225k @4.5%  
piano: $49k @\~8%

Current assets:  
retirement accounts: $\~250k  
brokerage accounts: $\~60k

I plan to refinance my home soon and roll my piano debt into my mortgage, hopefully with a lower interest rate on the mortgage as well.  At this point I make substantially more than I spend monthly so I should have at least $2k/month in surplus, quite possibly more depending on if I'm under what I budget each month for various things.  My budget includes the $6k and $19k per year limit for my retirement accounts so retirement contributions are maxed out.

I have two options that I can see:

1. I can pay off my house.  I believe that this will be possible to do within 7 years at the most but I \*think\* I can do it in 5 if I use a HELOC (I've written a python script that can do a monte carlo simulation on this as well as manage the complexity of handling it for me).  Please trust me that my math is correct based on the type of HELOC I can get through my credit union.
2. Take the $2k/month and invest it.  I'm way more aggressive than I should probably be with investing but I do pretty well with it and I like ETFs a lot.  With this strategy I'm still making extra payments against the principal of my mortgage (I'll have a reduced payment but I plan to pay the same as I currently do against my existing mortgage).

personalfinance,Business license and county taxes for small one person tutor?,"Posting for my friend who doesn't have Reddit and asked me to post. 

My friend lives in Florida. She started a small tutoring business last year. It's just herself and she travels to people's homes to tutor them. She made $3000 in a year. She was doing her taxes and declared the income on a schedule c alone with her write offs (mileage, home office deduction because she does the bulk of her work from there, etc). Someone told her she needed to get a business license from the county she lives in (orange) and needs to also pay state and county taxes. She thought it was just a little side business to make  extra income and she just had to pay federal taxes. She only did it for one year. So here are her questions:

1) if she starts tutoring again, does she really need a business license? 
2) does she owe county and state income back taxes? 
3) her primary job is paid cash by a company who doesn't want to have to pay taxes on it even though it really should be w2, because it's a secretary job. she declares the income as schedule c business because the company doesn't give her a 1099, and she can write off her depreciation expenses (like using her own laptop) which are not reimbursed. Will she have to register as a business even though it's not actually a business? Should this income be stated as a 1099 on tax forms instead even though she is not given a 1099?",finance
personalfinance,Should I wait to get a car till my loan is paid off or should I bite the bullet now?,"We currently have a 2013 Chrysler 200 that is reaching 100k miles and currently owe $3000 on the car with payments of $400 per month. When we got the car we had very bad credit and little to no history and got screwed over with an  18% interest rate. Since then my wife and I have built up our credit to the 650 range, and have never missed a car payment on our loan. Our 2013 is also draining a hole in our pocket when it comes to repairs in the last 6 months we have put 4k into it.  My question would be would it make for sense to finish off our loan or to go buy our new car now vs in 7 months when it has more mileage and potentially another problem to happen to it?",finance

personalfinance,Wife is salary but pay constantly fluctuates,"Hey everyone! I'm hoping anyone can shed some light on this situation my wife told me about today.

My wife works for a financial advisory group, funnily enough, and since she has been hired on, making a salary and NOT being paid hourly, and her paycheck has been completely different everytime she has gotten paid.

We got married in May of 2018 and we filed jointly. I set my allowance to 1 when we got married. When my wife started her job, she says she doesn't remember what she set her allowances to. She has been there for 4 months and has made the following amounts every 2 weeks:

&amp;#x200B;

|797.68|722.68|702.68|
|:-|:-|:-|
|697.68|757.68||

&amp;#x200B;

After her 3rd month of being there, she got a small raise and started making more:

&amp;#x200B;

|821.56|811.56|761.56|
|:-|:-|:-|


&amp;#x200B;

I myself am making a salary of \~50k and I get paid twice a month and it is the exact same amount every paycheck.

She talked to the guy that does payroll, the tax guy, and he says the reason behind the fluctuation is because of our tax bracket, 15%, and that the government is changing the withholdings on us, which I called BS on.

I googled this and, from what I could make sense of with the IRS' legalese, it seems, to me at least, that unless my wife is making the request of changes to her allowances/withholdings, the changes are illegal.

Anyone have an idea as to what could be going on?

I'm not putting it past the guy to try to pull a fast one on us.

Thanks everyone!

Interest rates(financing)via chase are not bad so I’m not opposed but I honestly do not know enough about wire transfers to know if it is normal or suspicious. Any input would be greatly appreciated.

# CALIPH FOR U.S. PRESIDENT IN 2020

### PRESENTED  HERE IS A DISCUSSION OF :  

###      Moshenian Economics IN THREE PARTS  -- National / Global / Expansion.

###      It presents simple plans for debt free currency systems that any and all nations can use to free themselves of outside influences and forces which have presently enslaved almost all nations to never ending personal and national debts which is MODERN DEBT SLAVERY and must be stopped.

&amp;#x200B;

\----------

### National (USA or any nation) monetary policy : 

### The fact is, in 1933 the U.S.A.  GAVE UP IT'S SOVEREIGNTY, and became a debter nation with the NATIONAL BANKING ACT OF 1933, AS SUCH....  FDR... found an unconstitutional way to force all the people(emergency war powers)... to become subject to pay that debt to creditors who then own our nation as collateral.     The problem now being that we owe the debt for not only the 200 Billion a year, plus the commonly known 19 Trillion dollars, but also we would need to re-value all DOLLARS in circulation or risk their devaluation which can add up to 100-200 maybe 300 Trillion dollars.   And so, the problem is, we..  like most nations do not have the gold. we already paid all our gold as interest payments and have run out, and as such, our government has enslaved our people to pay excess taxation to pay the debt to our creditors who NOW RULE OUR NATION, AND WORLD.      WE ALL GOT ROBBED....  and I propose a fix... NORMALLY we could not pay off the debt because THAT would require a vault of gold to pay it off, and WE HAVE NO GOLD...   but...   we do have vast land...   with vast mining potential, and if we, say by A constitutional amendment allowed our Federal Government to run vast mining sites using prison labor, then we as a NATION...  could..  have the viable..  realistic...  predictable...  credit potential.. to pay off all our nation's debts.. and revalue our currency to a stable, non-inflationary value, and so end the endless drain which has been the national debt.      I CAN MAKE IT HAPPEN.SEE --- &gt;   [http://caliphofgod.org/SOVEREIGN-NATIONAL-ECONOMICS/](http://caliphofgod.org/SOVEREIGN-NATIONAL-ECONOMICS/)

### --------------

### Global Monetary policy :  A GLOBAL CURRENCY  :

###    As should be clear, national debts could in many cases be difficult to pay off with the projected mining resources which may be gained if any nation maximized it's resource potentials on the surface,  short of deep shaft mining efforts., which is why each nation should support the GLOBAL EXPANSION EFFORTS, and the formation of a LIMITED world government, as such affords the credit and funding to allow all nations big and small to SHARE IN THE NEW INTEREST FREE CREDIT POTENTIAL GAINS predicted and fund their own national expansion efforts for GLOBALLY SHARED territory on the OCEANS BOTTOMS, ANTARTICA, THE MOON, MARS, AND THE ASTEROID BELT all built with this new interest free credit potential .  As such, each nation as investor STAKE HOLDERS IN THE WORLD GOVERNMENT they expect a return, and that return would be in preset % percentage solar system wide mining gains, and colonization, and populating the many Antartic cities, floating islands, under water cities, air floating cities, orbital space bases, lunar colonies, Mars colonies, and eventually nation based launch vehicles which we as a planet will soon send to all local star systems, where it does not matter if we find usable worlds.  WHAT MATTERS, is that we find usable asteroid belts of loose matter to collect, mine and process to build ever larger and more advanced space bases for our people to survive no matter what we find at any given star, IF THERE ARE NO PLANETS, THATS OK, for we can build our own space bases, or our own planets over time.      SEE -----  &gt;   [GLOBAL ECONOMICS](http://caliphofgod.org/A-GLOBAL-CURRENCY-SYSTEM/)

### ------------------

### ECONOMIC GOALS, PLANNING AND HOPE = A PROSPEROUS DESTINY UP INTO THE HEAVENS :

### THESE ECONOMIC POLICY PROPOSALS ARE BASED ON THREE SIMPLE STEPS :

### 1) NATIONAL SOVEREIGN CURRENCIES, based on future mining potentials of each nation. (Deep shaft mines can become clean energy generators once they reach depths of 2-10 kilometers.)

### 2) GLOBAL CURRENCY AND INVESTMENTS, based on international land values, Anartica, and the ocean floors. (The world should share the international lands and allow a world government force to mine it and distribute the resource gains.)

### 3)  A MASSIVE INVESTMENT POTENTIAL, created by the world recognition of our ownership of our solar system, and since we have the technology and means to begin accessing those resources, we can, with honesty create a FUTURES BASED SECURITY CERTIFICATE...   A FAITH NOTE...   BASED ON OUR BELIEF AND FAITH... that if we make the investments and build the machines.. that we WILL WITH ABSOLUTE CERTAINTY...  PRODUCE GAINS... profitable gains...  over time, and make it possible to pay off all the debt and investments which were made to start the ventures... and the doing of that...  FUNDS..  OUR EXPANSION INTO SPACE...    AN UNLIMITED EXPANSION...  where our species... can begin seeding the stars.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

personalfinance,Is it smarter to do a lower down payment on this house?,"Seeking opinions:

Currently buying my 2nd house.  Have a good profit from selling the 1st house.  We're under contract and I have the 20% down.  However, the credit union I'm going through DOESN'T charge PMI if you put less than 20% down.  What they do is raise the interest rate 0.5%.  I also have a sizable personal loan with almost 5 years left on paying it.  I'm playing with the idea of putting less than 20% down on the house to pay off the personal loan in full and take the hit of the higher interest rate.  Obviously this is foolish if we stay in the house for 30 years.....but we don't plan to (at this time) and are already doing a 5/1 ARM based on that fact.  The idea is that in 4-5 years we will sell the house or if we need to stay (especially if the market tanks), we can refinance at that time. (hopefully into a 15 yr fixed)   

The numbers:
House Purchase price:  $450,000
Savings planned for down payment:  $90,000  (20%)
5/1 ARM interest rate if 20% down:  3.875%
5/1 ARM interest rate if 10% down:  4.375%
5 year personal loan amount:  $30,000   
Personal loan interest rate:  10.75%

Option 1:
Put the full 20% down.  Get lower interest rate for first 5 years.
Monthly mortgage (P+I) pymt = $1,700
Monthly personal loan pymt =  $650  (for 5 years)
Total per month for 5 years:   $2,350  

Option 2:
Put less down and pay off the personal loan.  Pay 0.5% more interest to mortgage but ZERO interest to this personal loan.
Monthly mortgage (P+I) pymt = $1,950
Monthly personal loan pymt = $0
Total per month for 5 years:   $1,950 

The other con with Option 2 is that we have less equity in the house, but seems to me we have more cash flow each month to not get ourselves into debt trouble again.

stocks,Tesla Goof... Thoughts?,"I Done Goofed...

Tesla had been going back and forth between 300 and 330 for a few months it seemed, always staying within that range. I finally decided to buy in at around 300, thinking I could catch the upswing. 

Unfortunately, Tesla was struck with bad news a few days after my purchase (typical). Naturally, I assumed it was temporary and that they would bounce back as they had done so many times before. But alas, the bad news seemed to roll in more steadily as time went on. Now I’m stuck with Tesla sitting at \~$185 and left feeling like a total fool for trusting in them. 

At this point, what do I do? Do I hold and ride it out, hoping for any sort of gain above $200, or dump in the fear that they will continue to drop for the foreseeable future? I know the odds of me making back that $115 a share drop are impossibly slim right now, but if I could even get a sliver back I’d take it.

personalfinance,"First time contract/fee for service employee, can use clarity on some things!","Hi All,

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a licensed therapist and have always had a full time salaried position. For the first time, I am starting a **contract/fee for service** position so I have a couple of questions about how quarterly taxes work. I appreciate any and all feedback!

&amp;#x200B;

1)  When I get paid from my ""employer,"" how do I separate what I will owe for taxes? I don't want to just deposit my whole check into my bank account because a good % of that money isn't mine to spend! My accountant told me that for my taxes I will owe  **21%** for federal and **3.07%** for state. So I'm assuming I should take **24.07%** off of every check that I get, right? but then what? do I open another bank account just to store my ""tax money""?

&amp;#x200B;

2) I only have a personal bank account at the moment. Should I be depositing the rest of my check (what's left over after I pay taxes) into my personal account, or is there a benefit in opening a business account?

&amp;#x200B;

3) If I understand quarterly taxes correctly, I am estimating four times a year how much I will be making  each quarter, right? But what if I'm  due to be making significantly more next quarter and the estimated tax is more then I can afford at the moment? 

&amp;#x200B;

4) I took a look at the 1040es that helps estimate taxes but it literally looks like a different language to me! Are there any good websites or resources that can break this down for me!

&amp;#x200B;

5) If I have an independent business OUTSIDE of this contract position, do I file a separate 1040 for each business or is all of my income regardless of source put on one 1040 form,

Greetings Personal Finance!

After all of my bills are paid each month, I have an extra $1500-$2000 left over depending on utilities, insurance, or other small variables that month. I do have a few months of savings as well.

My question is, what account should I concentrate paying off? What order should I pay things off?

In my mind it seems that paying off the items with the highest interest rate (Motorcycle B) first would be best so I am not paying more in interest; but interest is so low on everything that perhaps paying off the account with the largest monthly payment (Car A) to free up some extra disposable income would be best (Snowball?).

My initial plan was to pay off card 3, then card 2, then card 1. While paying off card 3, the current payments I am making on the other two cards would stay in place, rather than just pay their minimums. 

Would the savings be substantial enough if I dropped card 1's payment to minimum and put that extra to the two higher interest cards (card 3, then card 2) to actually shorten my payoff window?

I went to school on a scholarship but my parents gave me the money they had saved for my college anyway, so between that and the second income for a few years we had a huge headstart. We're both frugal by nature and have had a SR over 50% for my entire career.

Wife still works one day a week and I do expect to have a little side income, but ignoring that the WR is a bit under 4%. We give a lot to charity, so I have some flexibility if the long-awaited crash actually materializes.

investing,Municipal Bonds 101:,"**Introduction:**

Municipal bonds are often though as tax-free debt instruments only appropriate for investors in the top tax brackets. On the contrary, municipal bonds offer advantages to investors in all tax brackets. Some of the benefits of munis are:

Low refinancing risk. Municipal debt is typically self-amortizing where periodic debt service payments consist of both principal and interest. This enables repayment of principal with less reliance on future market access.

High credit quality. Because they are issued by governments, they often have high credit ratings.

Low default rates. Again, compared to other fixed income asset classes, munis have had historically low default rates.

Attractive Yields. Municipal bond yields compare favorably to major other FI sectors, even exclusive of the tax advantage.

**History of municipal bonds:**

Municipal bonds have played a vital role in American history. Munis were a major source of financing for canals, roads, and railroads during the country’s westward expansion in the 1800s. Today, the proceeds from municipal debt continues to fund schools, hospitals, universities, airports, bridges, etc.

[https://imgur.com/a/02fyVa4](https://imgur.com/a/02fyVa4)

**What are municipal bonds?**

These are bonds issued by US state and local governments and eligible for non-profit organizations. When you buy a municipal bond, you’re lending money to the government to help fund projects such as building roads, fixing sewer systems, and to build schools.

Muni interest payments are exempt from federal income taxes and state income taxes for in-state residents. To determine the desirability of a given municipal issue, it is necessary to calculate the tax-equivalent yield and then compare it with its taxable counterpart.

**Tax-equivalent yield:**

Yields on munis are usually quoted in their tax-equivalent yield, which represents the yield on a fully-taxable bond. Because these are tax-exempt instruments, they typically offer a lower yield than their taxable counterparts.

The formula for tax-equivalent yield is: Tax-exempt yield / (1-marginal tax rate)

For example, an investor in the 40.80% marginal bracket federally holds a muni that yields 5%. This bond would need to yield 8.45% on a taxable investment to provide the equivalent amount of after-tax income.

An investor in the 35.8% marginal bracket would need to earn 7.79% on a taxable bond to earn the same as the 5% muni.

[https://imgur.com/a/VtfFxPS](https://imgur.com/a/VtfFxPS)

**There are two types of municipal bonds:**

In general, municipal bonds fall into one of two categories: General Obligation Bonds and Revenue Bonds.

*GO Bonds:*

* General obligation bonds at the state level are secured by the state government’s pledge to use all legally available resources to repay the bond. At the local government level, general obligation bonds are backed by an ad valorem pledge that can be limited or unlimited.

o Limited tax: Secured by a pledge to levy taxes annually “within the constitutional and statutory limitations provided by law”

o Unlimited tax: Secured by a pledge to levy taxes annually “without limitation as to rate or amount” to ensure sufficient revenues   
for debt service

*Revenue Bonds:*

* Revenue bonds are secured by a specific source of revenue earmarked for repayment of the revenue bond.

o Enterprise revenue bonds are typically issued by electric utilities, water and sewer plants, toll roads, etc

o Tax revenue bonds are backed by dedicated tax streams, such as sales tax, utility tax, or excise tax

[https://imgur.com/a/UlMETMh](https://imgur.com/a/UlMETMh)

**Size:**

The municipal bond market has $3.8tn outstanding debt versus the corporate and foreign bond markets which have $12tn. While the muni market is smaller in terms of debt issuance, there are far more municipal issuers than corporate and foreign bond issuers.

**Debt Structure:**

The typical municipal bond structure includes level debt service payments and annual principal amortization. These payments are relatively level from year to year, allowing an issuer to better align reoccurring revenue streams with annual debt service payments. This structure lowers refinancing risk, meaning municipal bondholders may be less concerned when systemic risk is elevated. In comparison, the typical corporate and sovereign bond structures include interest-only payments and a balloon principal payment at maturity. This structure is more vulnerable to refinancing risk if the issuer chooses to refinance the balloon payment.

When structuring a municipal debt offering, an issuer must take into account a broad range of legal, policy, and financial objectives. The majority of muni debt outstanding is backed by dedicated revenue pledges. Investors typically want assurance that pledged revenues will be sufficient for debt service payments, so as part of the structuring process a bond ordinance or trust indenture will explicitly outline provisions governing the flow of funds securing the debt and bond covenants.

Callable securities generally offer a stated maturity, but allow the issuer an option to redeem the bonds prior to maturity after an initial non-call period. The majority of longer-dated municipal bonds carry a 10-year call provision. When IRs fall, an issuer is more likely to exercise a call provision to retire what has become high-interest debt and reissue new debt at the prevailing lower rate.

**Credit quality:**

The majority of state and local governments are highly rated, whereas corporate credits tend to have lower ratings. 93% of municipal issuers rated by Moody’s are currently rated single-A or higher. By comparison, only 24% of global corporate issuers are rated single-A or higher.
