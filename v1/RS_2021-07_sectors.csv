personalfinance,Need some advice on house purchasing,"Hi All,

I and my GF are relocating to another city (in Texas) for work. Currently I own a house that's fully paid off, so here are my options:  
  
1. Get a mortgage first, and then pay off most of the loan after selling my current house. I think this is the preferred way since we can avoid needing a place to stay in between. However I'm not sure what is the best way to handle the mortgage: I assume since I can pay most of the mortgage off after selling my current home, the interest rate and APR is less of a concern for me? Should I just go with my bank since it's probably more reliable? And does it matter if I get a loan myself or get the loan together with my GF (we do plan to get married very soon)? Also I and my GF can contribute differently on the down payment, what is the best way to handle the title and deed?  
  
2. Another option would be selling my home first and hopefully buy a new home with cash. But we would need temporary housing which is not something we prefer. Is there any benefits for doing this (other than saving a few months worth of interest on the loan)?  
  
Is there another way that this can be handled? Please let me know, thanks!",finance

personalfinance,Keep current mortgage or refinance - Don’t see a big difference in changing from current mortgage to literally save $3,"The current balance on the home is $206,270. There is still 20 years left to pay. No PMI. Mortgage payment is $2301 per month. The Interest rate is 4.25%. This is an FHA loan. 

The refinance amount will include closing costs. The new loan amount will be $230,000. The term of the loan will remain the same, 20 years. Monthly payments will be $2298 (big fucking deal!) The new interest rate will be 2.75%. This will be a conventional loan. 

So the question is, refinancing adds $24K but less of an interest rate. But the payment will be 3 fucking dollars less. Is it worth it?",finance
personalfinance,Refinance Mortgage to 15 yr vs. Extra Payment on current 30 yr loan,"Hi all, looking for some advice on refinancing our mortgage.  

I am trying to gauge what makes best for my family at this point.  We just built and moved into a house last July so this coming July will be our first full year in the house.

The house was valued at 390k when we bought the house, might be worth more now that housing pricing have started to creep up.  We owe 310k and are locked into a 30 yr at 3.125%.  I'd like to pay off the house as fast as I can.  With both our income, we make around 312k.  My wife has med school loans she has to prioritize, but otherwise we are sitting on a lot of cash that is accruing and can afford a higher monthly rate if need be.  We both have excellent credit.  Our current monthly payment (principal and interest included) is 1373/month.  With taxes and insurance, this rounds up to 1751/month.  I started automating a roundup to 2000/month, putting in extra money towards the principal.

My question is, would it make sense to refinance at current interest rate lows at a 15 yr fixed rate, or just continue paying extra into our 30 yr fixed rate?  

Also, any recommendations on mortgage refinance banks would be appreciated.  I have already reached out to Quicken Loans and will be calling PenFed tomorrow morning when they open.  Thanks ahead of time!",finance

personalfinance,Need Advice for Online Banking!,"\[Tagged **Other** because I don't know which tag to use.\]

Good day, fellow finance enthusiasts!

I'm a college student in moderate financial standing, looking for suggestions for online banks. I feel like I have a lot of options and I just don't quite know what would be best for me. I currently bank with Chase and while I love their customer service, they have absolutely abysmal interest rates on their savings accounts (I'm currently earning 0.01% APY) and I'd love a little more bang for my buck, so to speak. I'm looking for a good online banking experience for both checking and savings accounts, with a decent APY and free overdraft protection (if I can get it). Another huge bonus would be lots of fee-free ATM locations, as I work in food service and bring home cash tips that I like to deposit. Honestly, I just want my meagre funds to be safe and sound, collecting some interest, while I try to add to them myself.

The banks I've looked at so far have been Ally Bank, Alliant Credit Union, Discover, and Capital One. Each has their pros and cons, and I am constantly aware of the lesson taught to me by my personal finance professor last year: *""If it sounds to good to be true, it probably is.""*    
I am wary of Ally because I feel as though it is a very new establishment and I'm not sure if that makes a difference in the trustworthiness of a bank, but its interest rates and lack of monthly and yearly fees look amazing.    
Alliant has the best APY I've seen so far, but because it's a credit union, I'm unsure about the requirements for joining. According to its website I need to become a member of their charity (I don't meet any other membership requirements), but I'm very unsure as to what that entails exactly and am very hesitant to jump in. This bank also has the most ATM locations, from what I can tell.    
Discover has a good-looking checking account, but I've not been able to find much about savings. I'm very enamored of its Cashback Debit card, but I don't spend all that much every month and I'm not sure if I want to use my debit card for every purchase I do make.    
Capital One also has nice-looking accounts (I looked at their 360 checking and savings), but the APY is a little lower than Ally's or Alliant's. However, I have more trust in Capital One because of family using it and because it's a familiar name.

So, here I am. I welcome any suggestions anyone has, and if anyone needs more information, please feel free to ask!",finance
cybersecurity,Announcing r/cybersecurity_help - the new home of personal cybersecurity support questions!,"**TL;DR:** The Personal Security Support Thread wasn't a universal win, so we're trying something new - r/techsupport for cybersecurity! If you're interested in helping individuals with cybersecurity questions, please join our new sister subreddit, r/cybersecurity_help!

For the past month, we've been working on a few changes to the r/cybersecurity subreddit, the biggest of which has been changing how personal support questions are handled. We posted a big writeup about the changes [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/o3j0h7/sub_update_reviewing_requesting_feedback_on/), but to be quick:

* **Big win**: The moderators save a ton of time.
* **Big win**: The community sees fewer unwanted posts.
* **Miss**: Engagement dropped on personal support questions.

The drop was quite substantial, even. &gt;90% questions in the Personal Security Support monthly thread were answered by only a handful of people, and a good chunk went unanswered. This isn't really sustainable, and was a bit confusing for us initially, since a lot of people would help out when the few unwanted posts would slip through when posted as ""Other!""

The reason for this is that it's a relatively small burden for people to see a post and then decide to help - this is why r/techsupport as a concept works, subscribing is easy and allows for self-selection, then helping out when something comes up that you know about is easy too. Having to go to a specific thread is harder, because you need to actually be motivated to end up there - Mentorship Monday works because people are *really* motivated to go there. Personal Security Support doesn't benefit from the same motivation. This is totally understandable - you'll notice that I dropped off after a few days in the PSSM thread too ;P

We weren't able to figure out a good option for keeping traffic going to the PSSM thread without a bit of self-spam on this subreddit, like weekly (?) or similar reminders to please lend a hand. This feels intrusive and unwanted, and therefore is not a reasonable solution.

So, how can we make sure that posts are seen? The obvious answer is get them to a well-staffed support subreddit, but there are a handful of problems with existing subreddits:

* r/techsupport doesn't allow malware samples or possibly-malicious links
* r/antivirus and r/phishing are specialized communities not oriented towards general security questions
* r/cybersecurity101 would be overwhelmed by our support volume
* etc.

Dissatisfied with those options, we're trying a riskier option - making our own support subreddit, r/cybersecurity_help. This allows members from our community (and other technical subs!) to help out with personal support questions, without compromising on the professional-forward nature of this subreddit. So if you are one of those people that likes to help out individuals, come join r/cybersecurity_help! This subreddit has techsupport-like rules, enforces that all questions should be well-titled and fully fleshed out with information, and has a few crafty bits of moderation built in to help enforce quality.

For the first month, we're going to gauge the popularity and response rate - but if it works, some of the later ideas we had for it are:

* Community-curated assistance content for helping out with specific questions
* Automatically replying to posts with the above solutions to reduce repetition on the subreddit
* Possible ties between professional subreddits to show custom flairs/signets/etc for extra helpful members
* And more!

As always, please let us know how you feel about this idea, and if there's anything we could do to improve it (or personal support in general) in the short or long term!",technology

personalfinance,Federal Withholding,"A bit of confusion in my workplace today. A coworker and I received our pay stubs today and compared them. We have the exact same hourly rate, same hours, and same deductions, besides federal withholding. He paid $40 more in federal withholding than I did, although I claim Single, 0 dependents and he says he does as well. This meant my take home pay was $40 higher than his, but we don’t understand why. So far this year I have grossed $38,000, while he has grossed $37,000, (I’ve worked some overtime) but I don’t see how this could have any effect on federal withholding. State taxes were the same down to the penny, so could anyone shed any light on what may have caused this difference? Side note, I entered in my situation into a tax calculator and it was much closer to what my pay stub looked like than his.",finance

personalfinance,Looking for student loan refinancing with bad credit payment history.,"Hello. I finished college this past December and I have started working this in April. To give you an idea, I make more than $5000 per month (gross) as a Data Engineer. I currently live with my parents but I am currently looking to move to Philadelphia as early as August.

Over 3 years ago, I had opened 3 credit cards. Long story short, I screwed up. I ran them up to their max and didn’t pay them off. They all went to collections at some point. From winter of 2019 to summer of 2020, I was able to pay off everything. One of the cards was also removed from my history. Since then, my credit score went from the low 500s to low 700s. I was able to responsibly build my credit back up opening some credit cards, using them, and paying them off with no issues.

I have enough student loan debt to be facing over $1300 per month in loan payments. My parents made enough money to not qualify for real federal aid but not enough to pay for college themselves. They went into repayment days ago and my first payment is in August. 

I’m running into a problem where I’m applying for refinancing and getting denied. The common reason given is because of my payment history. Despite perfect payments over the last year and how much my credit score went up, those delinquencies still show a history of several missed payments.

I just want advice on how to handle that. Is there a way to get refinancing despite my delinquencies and (preferably) without co-signers or will I have to wait until those delinquencies go away 3 years from now? I’m not worried about surviving since I make enough. However, I want to be able to save and invest as much as I can.

Thank you in advance!

EDIT:

Further details on the loans

In total, about $139,000. About $21,000 of that is Federal and $118,000 is private provided by Citizens Bank. 

There are 6 federal loans, half subsidized and half unsubsidized.

The first two private loans are variable; one is $31,000 at 6.09% and the other is $41,000 at 6.34%.

The last two private loans are fixed; one is 23,000 at 9.24% and the other is 23,000 at 9.64%.",finance

cardano,"Cardano Rumor Rundown July 1, 2021","Hey Everyone!

Let's go...

Newly covered today: 

1. The Mithril paper is out and will be publicly available soon. Fast bootstrapping here we come! [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1410277976730603526](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1410277976730603526)
2. Charles says it looks like we will hit Alonzo white on Monday. [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1410279529021648896](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1410279529021648896)

Previously Covered but still interesting:

1. Alonzo “Blue” Era Testnet (through mid June; &lt;50 user cohort) will include the basic functionality of the system for testing basic contracts . Initially the SPOs will be included, then some of the Plutus Pioneers will be allowed in, then a few of the outside development firms (Plutus Partners). The Plutus Partners will be working on specific areas including oracles, DEXs, stablecoins, NFTs, and DeFi. This will produce code and documentation that will be publicly available.
2. Alonzo “White” Era Testnet (mid June to mid July; &lt;500 user cohort) will add more Plutus Pioneers and more functionality. They will develop various dApps and there will be interaction on the user side of these dApps. They will do some benchmarking at this stage.
3. The Alonzo Hard Fork Combinator Event requires a lot of different pieces come together at the same time. But, this is not their first rodeo and they have a lot of experience with this from the ITN, Shelley, and etc.
4. Alonzo “Purple” Era Tesnet (mid July to mid August; fully public) will involve a full public network with all of the Plutus pioneers, the Rosetta Api to the exchanges, Daedalus, hardware wallets, graphQL, and full functionality. The purpose of this phase will be optimization.
5. Alonzo “Red” Era Tesnet (August; a very short phase) will involve a new network where they can test scalability and stability.
6. Alonzo “Black” Era Tesnet (August; a very short phase) will be the final public testnet where they will ensure they have their candidate mainnet releases ready to launch on the mainnet.
7. They are committed to making sure there is a very large group of people who are familiar with using the Alonzo testnet by the time the mainnet launches.
8. Alonzo Mainnet (August-September). It’s looking like Alonzo mainnet launch was positioned in very late August through September in the infographics. That makes me assume there is a chance of August, much better chance of September, and also some chance of October or later. This is blockchain development after all. Also, we’ve waited years. Why care about a few weeks?
9. There will be another Plutus Pioneers Cohort later this summer.
10. Marlowe Run will be a browser product that can run on mobile or desktop. It can be linked to your wallet and be used to run Cardano smart contracts simultaneously on a distributed basis across multiple user browsers. The user interface is light years ahead of anything we saw in Marlowe Meadow or the Marlowe Playground simulations. It will include a library of off-the-shelf contracts.
11. There will be a Marlowe Webinar on June 3. Register here: [https://webinar.marlowe-finance.io/](https://webinar.marlowe-finance.io/)
12. The ERC-20 converter was looking very intuitive and seamless in the new demo. It should be on the testnet in June.
13. Manuel Chakravarty gave a big update on Hydra (layer 2 scaling). Hydra will not require that the base layer be modified since it will be implemented via Plutus smart contracts. Hydra is actually a collection of protocols including Hydra Head and Hydra Tail. Hydra Head is a symmetric protocol where multiple participants will be online simultaneously for the whole period of the head exchanging messages. Hydra Tail is an asymmetric protocol involving a high performance server and many clients that may be mobile and could be offline for large portions of the tail’s existence. There will also be “inter head &amp; tail networking” which will allow for a network of heads and tails. They have a published research paper on Hydra Head. They are currently writing the Hydra Tail paper.
14. Hydra is distinguished from other layer 2 protocols by its isomorphic properties. This means you will be able to run any smart contract that works on the base layer in a Hydra Head! This is very special. We won’t need special purpose contracts built out just for layer 2. There are some big implications to this. Since a Hydra Head is essentially just a Plutus smart contract, this means you can run a Hydra Head inside another Hydra Head. It’s turtles all the way down, guys. It sounds like they can do this iteratively as much as they want.
15. Aggelos also gave a good presentation on the importance of “skin in the game” in resource based consensus protocols (both proof-of-work and proof-of-stake) and its effect on promotion or discouragement of centralization. He explained how Ouroboros has built-in safeguards to prevent centralization including the K parameter (currently at 500) which caps total rewards per pool and the alpha parameter (currently at 0.3) which splits rewards into a 77% piece and a 23% piece. A pool can take its share of the 77% piece based on the pool’s total stake and its share of the 23% piece based on the pledge of the SPO. A higher alpha parameter makes it less attractive for individual SPOs to proliferate multiple pools since they can’t be as leveraged on their available pledge and still get as big a share of the 23% piece. This also discourages Sybil Attacks. As Cardano on-chain governance progresses, these parameters will be controlled by the community.
16. There will be a Cardano Goguen Summit in September. It will be hybrid digital/in-person.
17. Charles is helping to bring the cryptographer who broke SHA-1 to the University of Wyoming. The Cardano funded blockchain lab there could be on the road to be a powerhouse.

20. Professor Aggelos Kiayias recently dropped a video explaining exactly how Mithril (apparently neckbeard dungeon master talk for elf armor) is going to allow for Perfect Cardano (ADA) wallets that combine the ease of use and convenience of light wallets with the trustlessness of full node wallets. We also learned exactly how Mithril is going to work. [https://youtu.be/LhepJFCyWRk](https://youtu.be/LhepJFCyWRk)
21. In proof-of-work, bootstrapping can be done with blockheaders. This won’t do in proof-of-stake since we need information about stakeholder distribution to confirm block validity.
22. Mithril fixes this by being a cryptographic construction that enables a population of stakeholders to issue a signature consistent with certain constraints.
23. For Mithril to work in proof-of-stake, it needs three crucial properties: 1) it needs to enforce a threshold ratio of stakeholders before the signature is issued; 2) the pre-signature fragments must be independently verified and subject to public aggregation; and 3) it must be efficient in the sense that the final signature is of constant size and is logarithmically dependent on the # of stakeholders.
24. Stakeholders will issue special Mithril keys along with the normal cryptographic key material. Then at regular intervals, full nodes will test whether they can produce a pre-signature fragment. Only a random subset of stakeholders will be eligible to produce a pre-signature fragment. When a sufficient # of pre-signature fragments have been issued by eligible stakeholders then it will be possible to aggregate the fragments into a final signature.
25. This will be a checkpoint that will be verifiable with respect to previous check points all the way back to the genesis block. Such checkpoints will be cryptographic commitments of the relevant UTXOs.
26. Since the checkpoints will be trustless, a light client (i.e. wallet) will only need to verify the sequence of checkpoints up to the current time to trustlessly bootstrap.

94. The June Cardano 360 was yesterday. It is currently available on Youtube. [https://youtu.be/al5m14299ww](https://youtu.be/al5m14299ww)
95. We saw segments on various newer partner entities like Nervos, Orion Protocol, and Revuto. Nervos is a UTXO proof-of-work blockchain which is building a cross-chain bridge with Cardano so that you can use your ADA on Nervos dApps and vice versa. Interoperability is a big theme for Nervos and they plan to have a working testnet within a month. Orion Protocol is building a terminal that will allow for decentralized non-custodial trading across centralized and decentralized exchanges. They say this would not require you to KYC or even have an account with any of these exchanges. Revuto is an online subscription management service that recently completed a $10MM token sale on Cardano.
96. It was also revealed that Wolfram Labs, COTI, and IOHK have a three-way partnership (a ménage à tech) to build an NFT auction site. The people from Wolfram were talking about very interesting things including live minting during streaming events and automated upload to IPFS. COTI will be building out auction and bidding mechanisms in ADAPay.
97. Professor Aggelos Kiayias gave us an update on research including that Ouroboros Chronos and Hydra papers have both been accepted into conferences/journals. Chronos will provide Cardano with a global concept of time that doesn’t rely on any outside timekeeper. Prof. Kiayias also pointed out that Hydra is distinguishable from other layer two protocols in that the scripting language is identical to that of the base layer in Cardano such that any dApp that can run on Cardano will run on the Hydra L2. This is a huge plus and superior to many other layer two solutions in other ecosystems where the base layer dApps will not run on layer two. Finally, the Mithril paper has been submitted for peer review. It will provide Cardano light wallets with Succinct Non-interactive Arguments of Knowledge that will give us the best of both worlds: no delays for syncing as in full node wallets while still preserving trustlessness.
98. Finally, the Goguen Summit will be in late September. Sign up now at [summit.cardano.org](http://summit.cardano.org/).
99. The Fed is once again STRONGLY signalling to us that they are going to regulate stablecoins. The Fed is also specifically calling out Tether for the first time.

100. People are starting to realize that the Stakehound private key loss in ETH may attract unwanted regulatory attention to Ethereum 2.0 while this problem could never have occurred in Cardano. Also, only a few days later another ETH stakepool (this time SharedStake...the sixth biggest ETH Stakepool) allegedly experiences a rugpull that some are valuing at over $30MM. This is another problem that could not happen in Cardano staking. It feels like we stepped into the ring, they rang the bell, and ETH just started punching itself in the head. Eventually it’s going to KO itself.

CryptoCurrency,What’s the Crypto Community’s take on the future of central banks?,"The question is pretty straight forward. Central banks are an integral part of the current financial system and two major instruments for adapting monetary policy are the interest rates and money supply.

Both are adjusted by people deciding on appropriate values based on economic reasoning - they have to factor in the current economic cycle, inflation, government debt, the state of the market, purchasing power and all kinds of political stuff in the background. 

By doing so, they can stimulate the economy, influence inflation, defend their currencies against others, finance debt etc. 

Even though this system produces dilemmas and has flaws, the possibility to adjust these factors “manually” and impact the economy is quite important and one could argue that it saved some societies in the past crises. 

What’s your take on the future of this system in a world with decentralized crypto currencies? Will there also be adjustment mechanisms? Will they be automated? Will they be completely unnecessary? Why?",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,25% interest rate on a used car lease?,"**Edited with new info**

My friend is about to sign for a car loan that charges a 25% interest rate.

At first she thought it was a lease-to-own, but after talking to her about it it's clearly not a lease but a loan, and I think she genuinely doesn't understand the difference. The fact that the people at the dealership haven't explained that to her make me think they're just pressuring her to sign whatever they put in front of her.

I know this is a terrible idea but she insists she wants to do it because it will ""help her credit"".

The car is a 2018 Nissan Sentra with 80k miles for $400 a month with 25% interest for 24 months.

Her credit score is in the 500s, and she doesn't currently own a different vehicle.

Can anyone help me with some resources or information that will help her understand how bad of an idea this is? I am not personally savvy enough to fully understand or explain to her the implications of what she's doing, but I really want to help her understand what she's getting into BEFORE she gets tens of thousands of dollars in debt for an overpriced car.",finance

I'm not really familiar with the US government structure but I guess special FU's need to be given to Ben BerMonkey,  Henry Paulson for allowing this to go right under their noses.

Also not to mention how alot of Economic/ business professors from Harvard and Columbia University were also involved in this scummy business so Here's a special FU list for those involved in the documentary:

Martin Feldstein - Professor of Economics, Harvard -  Director of AIG and AIGF ( 1998 - 2009 )

personalfinance,I am going to buy a vehicle in 6 months. I need analysis help,"I am in need of another vehicle and I am not sure what to do.

My wife and I currently own a Lexus SUV and we have $18,000 left on it with a 2.39% interest rate.  We have about $40,000 (including emergency fund) and we have almost a year old daughter.  Another vehicle is necessary in case of emergencies.

I am a member of a credit union offering 1.89% APR for up to 72 months for vehicles 10 years old or newer.  Its hard to beat that.

Used vehicle prices at the moment are heavily inflated.  While less expensive, its not as much as it should be making a new vehicle more attractive, potentially the new vehicle will last longer.

I use to love sedans but I am an SUV convert because I also bring along fido making a family of 5 (he takes up two seats) cramped and I live in MN.


What should I do?  I am toying with gap insurance too if its an inexpensive one time fee because it is a depreciating asset and the loan rate is low.  That seems like a crazy idea, right??

[Edit]
I am going to buy a second vehicle and it is going to be an SUV.  While you may hold strong feelings its not necessary (let alone an SUV), I am looking for help in analyzing which route to take in securing a second vehicle.

personalfinance,Inheriting an IRA. What should I do?,"Earlier this month my dad passed away due to cancer, he didn’t have a will but for a few of his accounts he did designate me and my sister as beneficiaries. One of the accounts being a traditional IRA with a little over $500,000 in it. Additionally, he had a 401k with $32,000 in it, what he didn’t designate to us is going to probate court and I believe it’s likely going to be valued at around $50,000 once split between me and my sister based on spreadsheets he left behind. He had other assets like cars and what not but me and my sister don’t plan to liquidate them. His house, I believe is worth ~$260,000 but that is a ROUGH estimate based on property tax not appraisal, also he still owed a mortgage (around $100,000) on it so we’re not sure if we want to sell or pay it off but we’re leaning towards sell.

My biggest concern is with the IRA and 401k. I have no idea what to do with that money, and honestly, it makes me sick even think I get that much money from my fathers death. I want to use the money responsibly to honor him and build the life he hoped I would have when he decided to pass that much money onto us. I have a lite plan based on my current financial situation but I want it to be fleshed out more. 

At the moment, I’m a 21yo college student starting his last year of undergrad in the fall, the only debt I have is $20,000 in federal student loans which I believe will add up too somewhere around +$27,000 by the time I graduate next year and then more if I decide to go to grad school (psychology major). My plan for student loans was to take the assumed $50,000 going through probate court and invest it in different index funds in a betterment account, hoping it can accumulate to cover my current student loans and any others I rack up. My next thought was to liquidate the 401k and use it as a basis for basic financial stability ($10,000 emergency fund, $2,000 short term savings, $500 daily spending, and put the rest in a brokerage account). For the IRA, like I said I have no idea, I’m aware of the 10-year rule but I’m unaware of how to withdrawal the money in a tax efficient manner. Additionally, I want the money to grow more, I want to change the portfolio from a retirement based one that was designed for my father to one that would be optimized for growth in the current market but I’m not sure if would be the smart thing to do considering how rebalancing a portfolio might do more to hurt it than help it especially one as entrenched in reinvested dividends as my fathers. With the money I withdrawal I plan to put in my own IRA account and place the rest in a brokerage account to beat inflation. As for the house whether we sell it or not I don’t think my plan will change, only the proportion of it. Despite, the extent of my fathers assets me and sister still grew up a middle middle class family with our mother so handling money like this is new to us. I want to learn more though, since it’ll do nothing but help us. This is my plan based on a bit of research since I found out what me and my sister would be coming into. I’m open to suggestions and resources that’ll help me better understand what to do. Thanks.

stocks,"DD: $WHR Whirlpool, a well Internationally-Diversified Appliance Stock","Background: I originally came across this stock studying it during a project for an International Business class, and learned about how Internationally Dominant the appliance brand is. 

Markets:

[https://www.whirlpoolcorp.com/global-locations/](https://www.whirlpoolcorp.com/global-locations/) 

HQ'd in Benton Harbor Michigan, North America: has 14 Headquarters for manufacturing/distribution in North America in US, Canada, Mexico. 

Europe, Middle East, Africa: 6 plants in Italy, 3 in Poland, 4 elsewhere in the region

Latin America: 1 plant in Guatemala, 11 in South America

Asia: 4 plants in India, 4 in China, 1 in Singapore 1 AUS plant

Whirlpool is one of the most internationally dominant companies I've ever researched. It's no wonder it came up in a case study of my international business class, and as a IB major, I believe that companies like these have a huge advantage. With massive supply chains, and integration into multiple markets, stocks like these are both flexible and capable of huge earnings growth, as their dominance in larger foreign markets allows them to slowly integrate into more specialized markets.

Their PE ratio reflects this as it is trading just over a ratio of 10, but earning around 17 in it's 5 year average. A ratio of 10 is generally reasonable regardless of industry, and it's also ahead of it's dividend yield average, currently yielding at 2.57% 

With this international diversity, risk of political barriers to earnings are lower when so much of its sales are driven by foreign markets. 

Their balance sheet is also balanced with the company having a current ratio of about 1, but no huge concerns with long term debt. The company is neither under nor overleveraged in my opinion, and still has time to take advantage of cheap fed interest rates in the US

investing,Emergency Funds with Dropping Interest Rates in Savings,"Hello everyone!

I’ve read through some previous posts on here about emergency funds but haven’t found quite what I’m looking for. I have a taxable account that I use for options and speculative plays, another for long term investment in growth stocks I select, a Roth IRA I max contributions to annually, and a savings account with about 6 months worth of salary in it. 

My question is this: back when the interest rate on my savings account was 2%+ I didn’t mind having so much money in it but now that rate has dropped to 0.5% and is not keeping up with inflation. What are the opinions on keeping a months salary in a savings account and putting the rest in a portfolio composed of 40% IVOL, 30% VTI, and 30% ICVT? I understand the risk of not remaining liquid in an emergency so ideally, it would be a margin account allowing my funds to clear immediately if I needed to liquidate. I could rely on lines of credit as well if I needed to wait for funds to clear and pay it off before interest starts accruing. This account would contain 3-6 months worth of living expenses and an additional 30% buffer. Unless this account were to drop in excess of 30%, my emergency fund would not take a hit.

personalfinance,"Calculating the benefit of mortgage refiancing, accounting for additional payments","My wife and I are starting to look at refinancing our mortgage, and I want to make sure we know how to calculate everything correctly. We also want to take a number of other factors into our consideration and are seeking some guidance.

Our current mortgage was a 30yr fixed rate at 3.375% for a total of $200k. We have been making additional payments every month (about $500 extra) for a year now and have gotten the balance down to $188,200. 

In just some early checks, it looks like I'm pre-qualified to drop the rate to 3.125% with no discount points. This will drop our monthly required payment by about $80. 

The most ""extreme"" method would allow us to get all the way down to an interest rate of 2.75% with an APR of 2.944% ($3,097.27 fee). The website claims it would break even in 84 months. This option would lower our required payment by $116.

So this is where it gets confusing for me. Before we have kids, we would like to continue at our current level of payment to get the mortgage done reasonably quickly. (Goal #1) Once we have kids, one of us will probably see a reduction in our working hours, so the smallest monthly payment possible would be great (Goal #2).

It seems like if we keep making these additional payments with a lower rate, it will take longer and longer for us to break even on the REFI because we're accumulating less interest. The lower monthly payment is nice, but IMO secondary to paying off the house. 

How do I try to calculate this? Would a middle option be most beneficial since we're trying to pay it off early? Open to suggestions and help with trying to calculate all of this!",finance

btc,Regarding Yesterdays Congressional Hearing that Coincenter's Peter Gave Testimony,"I feel like the single missing part of regulatory talk in the united states on crypto is that no one understands that a unified clearing exchange for digital asset commodities will have to be built and the Token taxonomy act, and Digital Commodity act passed. 

&amp;#x200B;

CME can't work with blockchain. LedgerX and coinbase built the full financial stack. Traditional finance does not do this. Trad fi uses common clearing exchanges, prime brokers etc. It's economically unfeasible and untenable to expect every crypto service to build a full stack.  

&amp;#x200B;

 The obsession crypto people have with the SEC is misplaced. Bitcoin is a commodity. There has to be common backends that allow systemic risk monitoring and public data. That's how tradfi works, and US gov won't allow any other way. This is nonnegotiable for having a domestic market that institutions use. Right now all major institutions do significant derivative related things offshore.

This can't and wont last based on what the DoJ wants. You may not like the direction things are going, but this is necessary to mainstream adoption. Crypto is overwhelmed with fraud as it is. It's a net detriment to long term adoption.  

Re-- the bch crowd. I don't \*like\* being hunted by fed agencies and having all my services and access banned. I don't enjoy this lol. But this is inevitable for most regulated money. The feds have a mile long list of tools to enforce KYC on the globe. If poor people can somehow move a few hundred around without KYC, I'm all for it. But for people who move money, traders, we're screwed. If I don't get a regulated system built I won't be trading in crypto, period. US citizens are screwed on this. The CFTC is openly telling us ""we're going to enforce against DeFi Derivatives, we're gonna get you"". 

They can. They will. They're going to black list every non compliant DeFi app the way they blacklist mixers. Go look at Cipher Trace Traveler that binance introduced. That's what we have to lookforward to. They're going to create a fungibility crisis. Global bifurcation. Do I like this? No. This is totalitarian, but right now US control over the Executive branch is paltry. Mcafee was right about it all.

What would be a good enough interest rate to justify taking a loan? Should I take a loan from the dealership or find other financing options if I do take out a loan?

Edit: Thank you for the insightful inputs from some of you. This is good for new people who found this post to see more than one sided arguments so they can make their own conclusions. To those rude unhelpful responses, grow the f up.

A lot of people seem to think I don’t know how to stake. I wanna clear up staking isn’t the problem here, it’s how unfair the game is to small investors. Current maximum amount of validators is 297. Right now you can bond to a different validator when one becomes oversubscribed but what happens when Polkadot goes mainstream and majority of the validators are full? You have to compete with the richest 256 nominators in each pool, so a total of 76k nominators (297*256) can earn rewards, all the others are just locking up their DOTs for nothing. It’s not a big problem yet as we’re still early but we’re talking the future of Polkadot here when all the richer nominators start piling in. And as I see it, [Referendum 26](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/referendum/26) failed to get any support (99.97% or ~$2million voted to keep max validators at 297). The reason the max slots of validators is voted to stay at 297 is  because the network would get more complex and use higher bandwidth thus it’d cost more to run a validator.. oh we can’t have that! Only the small nominators are allowed to get effed. But sure yea, it’s me who should go get “educated” smh. I hope the best for y’all.

I like and have had always claimed 2 allowances on federal, also file married joint. This setup has allowed us to get a small refund and much more money in my pocket per check vs waiting a year for a refund, which I prefer.

Now I notice this is not simplified as just putting 2 in the box anymore. Askimg me stuff that I have no clue how to calculate and figure out even after spending an hour researching it. Is there something I can write or put on the 4 section to equate/be equivalent to the old way of 2 federal allowances for less taxes?",finance
personalfinance,"Non-profit sent husband a 1099, never a W-2. But says he is an employee, not independent contractor AND pays less than minimum wage. How is this possible? Tax implications?","My questions:

1) Aren't all employees supposed to receive W-2's instead of 1099's? 

2) If he is an employee, doesn't he have to be paid at least minimum wage? 

3) What do we potentially need to fix with the IRS if we didn't know he had W-2 wages last year and/or the organization didn't report any wages and did no withholding for him?

4) How do we know if the organization is withholding everything they're supposed to be (social security, medicare, worker's comp)? 

5)How can we know if they've already paid the employer portion of taxes so we don't end up double paying them as though he was a self-employed person?

&amp;#x200B;

Details:

My husband works for a non-profit playing music and sound effects for their sporting events. We've determined that he shouldn't be considered an independent contractor at the federal tax or state level because he shows up only at a certain time to work with everyone else in audio/visual production, uses only the equipment the non-profit provides, and works under the supervision and direction of his boss and the people directing the production of the events. 

He is paid on a per-game basis. He's typically there for 4.5 hours, but games often run longer. When we do the math to figure out what it equates to per hour, he is being paid below minimum wage. 

I assumed the organization was classifying him as an independent contractor because of what they were paying (he has no formal employment paperwork) and because for tax year 2019 they sent a 1099-MISC with the total in box 7 for non-employee compensation. We paid the self-employment tax and because he had no expenses to deduct from that (because he was using their equipment and isn't really an independent contractor) it ate a huge chunk out of his already meager earnings.

For tax year 2020 there were only a few events before the pandemic hit and we didn't receive any tax documentation. I figured it was because the amount of income was below the $600 threshold to report it, so I did not include it on our taxes.

Now they want him to come back and work again. He loves it, so he's all excited, but I asked him to clarify if they considered him an independent contractor or a volunteer. I figured these were the only options since they pay him less than minimum wage. But they said that he was an employee, ""just like last year"". What?! How?! 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR, Non-profit husband works for pays less than minimum wage. We thought he was an independent contractor because of a 1099 from tax year 2019. Made less than $600 and got no tax paperwork for 2020. Asked them if he was considered an independent contractor or volunteer paid a stipend. They said he was an employee ""same as last year"". No 1099 or W-2 received for 2020 tax year. What are the tax implications, past and future? Can employees make less than minimum wage?",finance

stocks,Building a Growth at a Reasonable Price (GARP) Portfolio,"I've been struggling these past few months at settling on a portfolio that I was happy with. I am young (23), so I wanted my investments to take advantage of that by being more aggressive with growth. At the same time, I realize that the current market is overextended, and a lot of the companies I really like are trading with a lot of that growth priced in. So, I wanted to put together a portfolio that would satisfy my risk/reward tolerance without having to pay a hefty premium.

The two pieces of advice that I greatly resonate with are:

1. Invest in a great company at a good price &gt; good company at a great price
2. concentration builds wealth, diversification preserves it

So I wanted to keep the number of stocks low (&lt;10) and put my money in companies for which I have high conviction. I started out by first creating a list of sectors that I think are best set up for hyper-growth in the next 10-20 years. For me, those are:

* Tech &gt; Information &amp; Communications / AI, AR, and Automation / Cyber Security
* Financial Services &gt; FinTech
* Healthcare &gt; Health Tech &amp; Genomics
* Consumer Cyclicals &gt; Internet Retail / Gambling
* EVs

Obviously, that list is not exhaustive, but those are the areas I feel the most comfortable with and in which I can see the long-term potential. I used that list as a starting point to look into companies and solidify the ones that will make up my portfolio. Some of the positions are more speculative than others, but I have found to have a compelling enough business model for me to invest in. If you have any criticism or suggestions, please comment below! I'm always looking to learn and discover great companies!

# Portfolio Holdings:

**FB**

For me, this was a no-brainer. The fundamentals are absurdly strong; pretty much no debt with a boatload of free cash. Consistent share buybacks (although not much) and increase in revenue. Outside of the main platform, it owns Instagram and Whatsapp which are incredibly sticky apps. Not to mention all the other projects they have going on (Occulus, FB Watch, etc.). What appealed to me the most was the fact that their ROIC is one of the best compared to the other FAANG stocks. There's also still room for ARPU to grow, especially on the international level. Instagram is also getting reworked to increase monetization. This stock is still undervalued/fairly valued and has, in my opinion, a lot more growth compared to some of the other FAANG companies.

&amp;#x200B;

**SOFI**

I wanted a piece of the fintech space, but the industry leaders PYPL and SQ are way too expensive for me to justify starting a position now. Comparatively, SOFI is trading way below their multiples and there's a lot to like about this company. With SPACs, a lot of the time the fundamentals do not match up to the hype they receive. However, SOFI's Q1 report showed tremendous YOY growth with promising guidance. They also show an increase in the number of users that use more than one of their services, which is an extremely important part of their identity. Now bears may say that this company lacks a moat because traditional banks can just enter the space easily, however, that's not considering one of the most compelling parts of this company, which is their acquisition of Galileo, a payment processor that is integrated with over 90% digital banks in North America and over 70 of the top 100 FinTech companies. So, even as more competitors enter the space, SOFI stands to benefit from that.

Not to mention their management team is stacked with talent. What really sealed the deal for me was the vision of CEO Anthony Noto. In a recent interview, Noto states that the reason SOFI hasn't gone international, despite the interest, is that they wanted to keep refining the product and make sure it can suit the user as best as it can before expanding overseas. This is a CEO that really cares about what they're building and the people who use it.

There's a lot of tailwinds for this company, and even if the fed does increase interest rates in 2022/23, they only stand to benefit.

&amp;#x200B;

**DKNG**

This position hinges on political policy, but I'm optimistic about it given how smooth the process of legalizing online betting in the US has been so far. The balance sheet may not be the cleanest, but companies like these typically spend a lot upfront in the form of CACs, and they've done an amazing job in that regard at making this company a household brand. Q1 2021 reports that monthly unique payers (MUPs) increased 114% yoy.

There's so much growth ahead in the short and long term. Over half the country has legalized betting (in some shape) in 3 years. The gambling market size is predicted to undergo hyper-growth in the next 10 years. Furthermore, DKNG has expressed interest in the esports scene, which is also something that has and will see explosive growth.

With that all said, I don't think the stock is cheap, and there are definitely a lot of risks here, but I believe in what they've done so far and can see a lot of upside in the long term.

&amp;#x200B;

**ABBV**

I was between this and BMY, and I might end up just going 50/50 in both. Great fundamentals, a lot to like. Strong top-line revenue growth yoy and a lot of free cash flow. Share buybacks every year, except for the most recent when they issued shares to raise money for their acquisition. There's some concern that HUMIRA, their most popular drug which makes up about 50% of their revenue, has its exclusivity period ending 2023, but their recent acquisition of Allergen positions them well for the future. ABBV is certainly not a crazy hypergrowth stock, but they still have room for growth and their dividend is king. Especially now, when it's trading at a very reasonable valuation, it's a great time to buy in.

&amp;#x200B;

**BABA**

I'm sure this stock needs no explanation on this sub. I really think this stock, or the likes of TENCHY, belongs in every portfolio that's focused on long-term growth at a reasonable price. So unless you're extremely against Chinese companies and the risk they may present, this is an absolute steal at these prices. In fact, right now most U.S companies are overvalued whereas almost every Chinese stock is undervalued.

&amp;#x200B;

**COIN**

I stayed far away from buying into this company when it IPO'd. Now it has fallen to a pretty reasonable valuation, so I decided to start a small position. I hold a small crypto portfolio myself and although I don't think crypto will replace fiat money, I still see a lot of potential in it long term for a variety of uses. If you don't believe in crypto at all, then it's a lot harder to justify buying into this company.

COIN itself is one of the most popular crypto exchanges and they posted blistering numbers in their 2021 Q1 report. Granted, a lot of that was tied to the initial explosion of crypto in mainstream media, but the conservative projections for the full year of 2021 are still great. Crypto is still in its infancy in terms of mainstream support and use and the potential TAM is massive.

That said in the short term, there will be a lot of volatility with this stock. That's why I'm starting with a very small position, with the intention to add if the numbers and guidance continue to impress. Bear cases made of COIN usually rests on the fact that there is nothing proprietary about COIN or that they depend too heavily on transaction fees, which I fully acknowledge, but they have the name recognition and the biggest userbase, and it'll be up to their management team to make the right moves and continue to innovate. I'm still learning about the crypto space, but there's a lot more than just a means of exchange.

&amp;#x200B;

**CLF**

American steel. Steel futures have been unstoppable lately, with the re-opening and word that an infrastructure deal is in the works, there's a lot to like about steel. News of China pulling back from steel exports also allows American steel to be more competitive in the marketplace. Yet, despite all these catalysts, the prices of companies like CLF are still lagging behind. This is not your typical growth play, and I personally see this as a short-term (6-12 months) position, due to steel's cyclical nature. I'll also admit I got into this a few months before when CLF was sitting at 18 a share. Still, CLF is poised to gain a lot, and quite a lot to like about this company. The management team under Lourenco Goncalves has revitalized CLF, making big acquisitions of AK Steel and ArcelorMittal USA. He's also recently gone and raised Q2 2021 guidance, and there's reason to believe that even that was conservative for how hot the industry is currently. 

If you're interested in learning more about the thesis behind steel, I'd suggest checking out r/Vitards. Anyways, I don't know if I'm going to hold this position for say 10+ years, so I'll be looking to capitalize on some short-term gains and use those profits to either open up a new position or fuel my current investments.

&amp;#x200B;

**TDOC**

This is also a very speculative position, similar to COIN. After the major pullback, I believe TDOC is at a very fair evaluation. Despite posting another quarter without profit, there's a lot to like about this company. They have one of the highest NPS scores, significantly greater than AMZN and APPL, which is something that's very compelling and which is something the balance sheet doesn't reflect. Combine that with the fact that they have captured a big chunk of the market, with healthcare professionals and big institutions, makes the company very, very sticky. Even if it only is the ""Zoom for healthcare,"" the quality is strong enough that users won't just drop it for just any other substitute. 

But it's not just the ""Zoom for healthcare"". The acquisitions it has made, both BetterHelp and Livongo, have amazing implications and have yet to show their full potential on TDOC's balance sheet. There's still so much of the healthcare space that can be innovated, and TDOC is primed to take over.

For right now, I'm OK with TDOC being unprofitable even with the pandemic pushing it along so well. That tells me they're funneling their revenue back into research and development to continue to build up its services and revenue streams.

I also believe that telehealth is still in its infancy, and even though it was massively adopted during COVID, that only accelerates its long-term use and adoption by a little bit. It's going to take a while before it becomes sophisticated enough for people to see the value. This is a long-term play to which I will be consistently adding.

&amp;#x200B;

**BARK**

Barkbox features in delivering monthly care packages for dogs on a subscription basis. This is something that's not as hyped as EVs, but pet care is a fast-growing market that sees more spending each year. In fact, quarantine boosted the number of pet owners in the US dramatically. Barkbox has seen tremendous yoy growth in revenue and subscriptions, with a CAGR, gross margins, and a returning customer rate that beats the industry leader CHWY as well as other popular brands. BARK has made a lot of partnerships with the likes of AMZN, WMT, TGT, etc., and looks to continue to expand vertically in the space of dog hygiene/medicine/food. All of this while trading at a much lower multiple than the other big pet care brands. 

The management team is fantastic. Manish Joneja, CEO of BARK, has 2 decades of experience as director of Amazon global exports and expansion and 5+ years on eBay as product lead. Carly Strife and Henrik Werdelin have been featured in Forbes 30 under 30 and Top 100 Most Creative/Top 100 people in tech, respectively. 

The bear case of this company is that they have no moat, but their customer retention speaks a lot to brand loyalty and satisfaction. CHWY also has a box subscription service for dogs, however, it's nowhere close to as popular as BARK. BARK is also expanding internationally, starting first with Australia.

Will it get to where CHWY is? That part isn't clear and it depends on how well BARK is able to build on what it has and expand what it has to offer. But the stock has a lot of room to run given the current valuation, and the product is sticky enough to either allow them to succeed or be a target for an acquisition.

personalfinance,"I was approved for an IRS payment plan, I got a notice in the mail that they enacted penalties, and that subject for further fines.","I had applied and got approved for a 6 month payment plan. 

I got a notice in the mail which appears to show that I am not on any such plan, since they have enacted penalties, and a failure to pay by a certain date could result in a fine of 50% of what I owe. 

Also, there is interest on what I owe, 3%. I am not sure if this is the normal payment plan interest rate, or the regular penalty payment plan. 

I am trying to find some sort of next step, but the only thing I can find is that I will need to call the IRS directly. I can't find an email or anything like that.",finance
personalfinance,Advice on finances just starting out graduating college,"Hello, I am new to Reddit and personal finance and I’m looking for some advice on what to do with some assets. I am a rising senior at a 4 year university and I have 202 shares of Disney stock that was gifted to me. Between 529 plans from parents and working during summers, I am going to graduate with a fafsa loan of $12k and I will owe around $11k for my final semester. Should I sell enough shares to cover the $11k and the federal loan? Should I sell the majority of my shares and diversify into mutual funds? I already have a Roth IRA funded with about $2k and about $10k between checking and savings. I would appreciate any advice.",finance
personalfinance,need help planning to pay student loan,"I owe around 60k in student loan(sub and unsub federal, not private loans). I didn't pay a dime till now because I was not making enough but the last two years I've been doing well with my self employment income and the extra income working at a company from home. 

I make around 3k to 5k pre tax (it varies each month) and I have around 40k in my bank. 

Should I recertify to pay the income driven repayment plan (it comes out to 800 per month), pay a lump sum from my savings (maybe 30k) and keep at it with the plan, pay a lump sum and keep paying as much as possible (I can probably pay over 2k if I try)? 

Thank you so much.",finance

Newly covered today:

1. Coti update from Shahaf Bar-Geffen. [https://twitter.com/COTInetwork/status/1410644013863124992](https://twitter.com/COTInetwork/status/1410644013863124992)
2. The Mithril paper (allows for trustless light wallets) is now available for your reading pleasure. [https://iohk.io/en/research/library/papers/mithrilstake-based-threshold-multisignatures/](https://iohk.io/en/research/library/papers/mithrilstake-based-threshold-multisignatures/)
3. The Ouroboros Chronos paper (allows for the blockchain to be its own timekeeper) is also now available.

Previously Covered but still interesting:

1. Manuel Chakravarty gave a big update on Hydra (layer 2 scaling). Hydra will not require that the base layer be modified since it will be implemented via Plutus smart contracts. Hydra is actually a collection of protocols including Hydra Head and Hydra Tail. Hydra Head is a symmetric protocol where multiple participants will be online simultaneously for the whole period of the head exchanging messages. Hydra Tail is an asymmetric protocol involving a high performance server and many clients that may be mobile and could be offline for large portions of the tail’s existence. There will also be “inter head &amp; tail networking” which will allow for a network of heads and tails. They have a published research paper on Hydra Head. They are currently writing the Hydra Tail paper.
2. Hydra is distinguished from other layer 2 protocols by its isomorphic properties. This means you will be able to run any smart contract that works on the base layer in a Hydra Head! This is very special. We won’t need special purpose contracts built out just for layer 2. There are some big implications to this. Since a Hydra Head is essentially just a Plutus smart contract, this means you can run a Hydra Head inside another Hydra Head. It’s turtles all the way down, guys. It sounds like they can do this iteratively as much as they want.
3. Aggelos also gave a good presentation on the importance of “skin in the game” in resource based consensus protocols (both proof-of-work and proof-of-stake) and its effect on promotion or discouragement of centralization. He explained how Ouroboros has built-in safeguards to prevent centralization including the K parameter (currently at 500) which caps total rewards per pool and the alpha parameter (currently at 0.3) which splits rewards into a 77% piece and a 23% piece. A pool can take its share of the 77% piece based on the pool’s total stake and its share of the 23% piece based on the pledge of the SPO. A higher alpha parameter makes it less attractive for individual SPOs to proliferate multiple pools since they can’t be as leveraged on their available pledge and still get as big a share of the 23% piece. This also discourages Sybil Attacks. As Cardano on-chain governance progresses, these parameters will be controlled by the community.
4. There will be a Cardano Goguen Summit in September. It will be hybrid digital/in-person.
5. Charles is helping to bring the cryptographer who broke SHA-1 to the University of Wyoming. The Cardano funded blockchain lab there could be on the road to be a powerhouse. [https://twitter.com/CaitlinLong\_/status/1398290866419105802](https://twitter.com/CaitlinLong_/status/1398290866419105802) [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yiqun\_Lisa\_Yin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yiqun_Lisa_Yin)
6. We don’t often get to hear from the engineers behind Yoroi over at Emurgo. But, here’s a podcast with Vicente Almonacid from Emurgo. Check out 12:50 where he mentions the dApp Connector (Cardano’s Metamask Equivalent).

8. Professor Aggelos Kiayias recently dropped a video explaining exactly how Mithril (apparently neckbeard dungeon master talk for elf armor) is going to allow for Perfect Cardano (ADA) wallets that combine the ease of use and convenience of light wallets with the trustlessness of full node wallets. We also learned exactly how Mithril is going to work. [https://youtu.be/LhepJFCyWRk](https://youtu.be/LhepJFCyWRk)
9. In proof-of-work, bootstrapping can be done with blockheaders. This won’t do in proof-of-stake since we need information about stakeholder distribution to confirm block validity.
10. Mithril fixes this by being a cryptographic construction that enables a population of stakeholders to issue a signature consistent with certain constraints.
11. For Mithril to work in proof-of-stake, it needs three crucial properties: 1) it needs to enforce a threshold ratio of stakeholders before the signature is issued; 2) the pre-signature fragments must be independently verified and subject to public aggregation; and 3) it must be efficient in the sense that the final signature is of constant size and is logarithmically dependent on the # of stakeholders.
12. Stakeholders will issue special Mithril keys along with the normal cryptographic key material. Then at regular intervals, full nodes will test whether they can produce a pre-signature fragment. Only a random subset of stakeholders will be eligible to produce a pre-signature fragment. When a sufficient # of pre-signature fragments have been issued by eligible stakeholders then it will be possible to aggregate the fragments into a final signature.
13. This will be a checkpoint that will be verifiable with respect to previous check points all the way back to the genesis block. Such checkpoints will be cryptographic commitments of the relevant UTXOs.
14. Since the checkpoints will be trustless, a light client (i.e. wallet) will only need to verify the sequence of checkpoints up to the current time to trustlessly bootstrap.
15. The ecosystem is growing so fast, it’s hard to keep up with all the projects without these infographics at this point. [https://twitter.com/Dr\_shwetaPHD/status/1398783893638103040](https://twitter.com/Dr_shwetaPHD/status/1398783893638103040)

24. Vitalik is saying it’s highly unlikely we see ETH 2.0 before late 2022. I’m guessing that means mid 2023 which will be after two years of Cardano slaughtering the entire ETH user base. Things are looking so bad that Vitalik says he doesn’t even like using the ETH 2.0 label anymore since he knows the changes will be more incremental. This is what early capitulation sounds like guys.

53. The Marlowe Webinar with Shruti is now available on youtube. Very interesting discussion of DeFi in general and also specific topics like “deep interoperability” in DeFi. Cardano is obviously already doing the very involved thinking about the future of DeFi. [https://youtu.be/vzsUSG5CSj0](https://youtu.be/vzsUSG5CSj0)
54. John O’Connor recently tweeted about a day where he “wrote a letter to a president” and “found a million users to bring into Cardano”.

58. Hedgefund Billionaire Paul Tudor Jones tells the world to buy crypto and certain other assets if the Fed doesn’t address inflation in their policy meeting that concludes on Wednesday. JP Morgan’s Jamie Dimon concurs that the current inflation is very likely not transitory. This could be tremendously good timing for Cardano given our top five status and the impending mainnet launch of smart contracts.

70. It’s a good sign that the top two crypto communities are spending so much time talking negatively about Cardano. You only focus your hatred on that which is most threatening.

71. Bloomberg just published a piece called “America Should Become a Nation of Renters”. While this statement is probably extremely polarizing for Americans, it can also be argued that the death of homes as the primary investment vehicle of Americans may open up a new wave of adoption in crypto as an alternative.

78. It looks like the second biggest ETH stakepool or it's custody provider has lost it’s users private keys to $75MM in ETH. Cardano doesn’t have this problem. We get to keep custody of our crypto because we found a better way than slashing.

83. We saw segments on various newer partner entities like Nervos, Orion Protocol, and Revuto. Nervos is a UTXO proof-of-work blockchain which is building a cross-chain bridge with Cardano so that you can use your ADA on Nervos dApps and vice versa. Interoperability is a big theme for Nervos and they plan to have a working testnet within a month. Orion Protocol is building a terminal that will allow for decentralized non-custodial trading across centralized and decentralized exchanges. They say this would not require you to KYC or even have an account with any of these exchanges. Revuto is an online subscription management service that recently completed a $10MM token sale on Cardano.
84. It was also revealed that Wolfram Labs, COTI, and IOHK have a three-way partnership (a ménage à tech) to build an NFT auction site. The people from Wolfram were talking about very interesting things including live minting during streaming events and automated upload to IPFS. COTI will be building out auction and bidding mechanisms in ADAPay.
85. Professor Aggelos Kiayias gave us an update on research including that Ouroboros Chronos and Hydra papers have both been accepted into conferences/journals. Chronos will provide Cardano with a global concept of time that doesn’t rely on any outside timekeeper. Prof. Kiayias also pointed out that Hydra is distinguishable from other layer two protocols in that the scripting language is identical to that of the base layer in Cardano such that any dApp that can run on Cardano will run on the Hydra L2. This is a huge plus and superior to many other layer two solutions in other ecosystems where the base layer dApps will not run on layer two. Finally, the Mithril paper has been submitted for peer review. It will provide Cardano light wallets with Succinct Non-interactive Arguments of Knowledge that will give us the best of both worlds: no delays for syncing as in full node wallets while still preserving trustlessness.
86. Finally, the Goguen Summit will be in late September. Sign up now at [summit.cardano.org](http://summit.cardano.org/).
87. The Fed is once again STRONGLY signalling to us that they are going to regulate stablecoins. The Fed is also specifically calling out Tether for the first time. You need to be thinking about how stablecoin regulation might affect your favorite Cardano DeFi or other project.

88. People are starting to realize that the Stakehound private key loss in ETH may attract unwanted regulatory attention to Ethereum 2.0 while this problem could never have occurred in Cardano. Also, only a few days later another ETH stakepool (this time SharedStake...the sixth biggest ETH Stakepool) allegedly experiences a rugpull that some are valuing at over $30MM. This is another problem that could not happen in Cardano staking. It feels like we stepped into the ring, they rang the bell, and ETH just started punching itself in the head. Eventually it’s going to KO itself.

CryptoCurrency,Is America Losing the Digital-Currency Race? (Long Read),"###With the explosive proliferation of cryptocurrencies, including China's introduction of a digital renminbi, it is not surprising to hear panicked warnings about the looming decline of the dollar. But the truth is that the greenback is the prime beneficiary of today's market developments.

WASHINGTON – America’s global position is slipping. The reign of the dollar is waning as China, Russia, and other potentially hostile countries digitize their currencies and create parallel payment networks that can circumvent the long arm of US and Western sanctions.

Or so we’re told. This narrative has been gaining traction among Western central banks, think tanks, and national-security analysts, who are right to be concerned about the future of money and payments.The Bank for International Settlements (a veritable central bank of central banks) recently released a report suggesting that central banks should introduce central bank digital currencies (CBDC) to keep Big Tech out of national payment systems.

It is certainly true that in the long run, the US dollar’s continuing dominance as the world’s most trusted global reserve currency is not guaranteed. But with the future of money and payments, past is prologue. Today’s doomsayers are wrong to think that the United States is losing ground. Such arguments in the media may help to attract clicks and drive engagement online, but they ignore the new elephant in the room: privately issued digital currencies, many of which are “stablecoins.” 

Unlike Bitcoin or Dogecoin, whose value fluctuates widely, limiting their use as a means of payment or store of value, stablecoins are tethered to transparent, auditable assets (like US dollar deposits or dollar-denominated holdings) and can reliably be used for everything from making payments to sending remittances seamlessly across borders. They are essentially CBDCs’ digital twins. The more that the debate focuses on the supposed clash between stablecoins – like Diem or the USD Coin (USDC) – and CBDCs, the more the bigger story gets missed. 

###IN DOLLARS WE TRUST

In that bigger story, the US is leading the world in a critically important industry. A vibrant, expanding ecosystem of responsible, well-regulated digital financial-services firms and trusted privately issued digital currencies are meeting the growing demand for Internet-native payment systems. And at the center of this explosion of digital currencies is the US dollar. (USDC, a dollar digital currency managed by the Centre Consortium – including my employer, Circle – is the fastest-growing dollar digital currency in the world.) 

As the most widely referenced stable asset underpinning this new ecosystem, the greenback’s position of trust will only grow stronger. Public blockchains, open-source technologies, and growing regulatory clarity for the industry have made the US the go-to place for digital financial-services firms. These companies are now hiring people from across the country and around the world to build platforms and operations that will have a global presence; many are already overcoming the buyers and spenders’ remorse that plagued blockchain’s maiden decade.

Investments in new payment and money platforms tend to gravitate toward countries that are embracing blockchain, digital currencies, and other foundational technologies. A good example is Singapore, which has been rebranding itself as the “fintech nation.” But notwithstanding the distributed nature of the blockchain ecosystem, this competitive, free-market activity is increasingly coalescing in the US as well.

###Globally, fintech entrepreneurs value the safety, soundness, and longstanding trust that US financial and democratic institutions command. It is for this reason that more than $100 billion in dollar-referenced stablecoins have been put into circulation, serving as the real-world scaffolding for the broader cryptocurrency asset class (which surged above $2 trillion this year).

As a foundational technology, blockchain is powering a booming creator economy, decentralized financial services (DeFi), and institutional-grade securities that are collateralized with cryptocurrencies and payable in stablecoins. While these emerging financial services may not be right for all investors and individuals, the players’ rights to access novel financial instruments that overcome the limitations of brick-and-mortar banking should be protected. These innovations are increasingly well regulated and enjoying institutional adoption.

###THE CRYPTO BOOM

Now 12 years old, the digital-currency industry is thriving. Blockchain distributed-ledger technologies emerged from the economic wreckage of the 2008 financial crisis and came out of beta in 2018, when they were the leading topic of discussion at the World Economic Forum’s annual meeting in Davos. In 2020, after a market correction known as “crypto winter,” Bitcoin shook off the cold. And now, a new generation of financial-services firms is showing how digital currencies and cryptographic assets can be used to complete the global financial system, rather than to compete with its core institutions. The flight to trust and quality that has given the US and the dollar its global standing in the macroeconomic environment is echoed in the growing blockchain ecosystem.

This is a positive development, not least because it offers a third way beyond the flawed “CBDC vs. stablecoins” debate – one that negates the potentially Orwellian risks posed by CBDCs. Lost in that narrow framing is the fact that most value-added money in circulation today already rides on private or consortium-led rails. Moreover, when properly designed and regulated, privately issued dollar digital currencies do not undermine any of the central tenets of the financial system, including the presumption of financial privacy, economic soundness (in terms of prudential asset management), and the availability of a widely used means of payment, unit of account, and store of value on the internet.

This ease of use helps to explain why USDCs in circulation have exploded from four billion coins in January of this year to more than 25 billion today (all backed by dollar-denominated reserve assets held in the care, custody, and control of the US-regulated banking system). Already, this meteoric growth has powered more than $700 billion in on-chain transactions.

Moreover, privately issued digital currencies are now the currencies of choice for crypto-native markets, including the rapidly growing creator economy in non-fungible tokens. Arguably the world’s first digital “Veblen goods,” NFTs have the power to unlock trillions of dollars of assets that are on the sidelines. This market-led model is the one that central banks around the world should embrace. Not only is it in keeping with the existing approach for all value-added money in circulation today, it also would preserve the two-tiered banking and financial system through which financial and monetary policy functions.

Looking past the dead-end “CBDC vs. stablecoins” debate, one can already see how ongoing free-market activity could translate into the US “winning” the digital-currency race. Digital numismatic innovations will continue to enshrine in code the first principles that have made the US financial system the global standard of trust.
As former US Secretary of the Treasury Hank Paulson notes in Foreign Affairs, a trusted global currency should be understood as the sum of many parts. A CBDC’s position depends not just on its desirability and reliability as a monetary unit, but also on the tone, temperament, and tenor of its issuing authority’s monetary, political, and security policies, as well as on the broader financial architecture that is constructed around it.

Hence, while the BIS takes a somewhat dim view on the industry, other authorities, including key US Federal Reserve officials, are pointing out that not all stablecoins are created equal. And in many circles, the knee-jerk determination to launch a government-issued digital dollar is being met with reasonable skepticism. 

In thinking about the future of money, and of any specific currency, the real geostrategic and economic battle lines will be drawn in the area of payments. The efficacy of a currency and the ability to enforce global financial-crime compliance standards depends on the openness, trust, access, and availability of payment rails. Viewed in these terms, one can already see that legacy financial systems are increasingly vulnerable to cyber threats and technological obsolescence.
Worse, most have been designed to serve only those born in the “right” country or postal code. Blockchain-based financial systems are offering solutions to problems of trust, privacy, and ownership that conventional analog designs have failed to address at scale.

###LEADING FROM BEHIND

The fastest way for the US or other Western economies to lose the Currency Cold War, as some analysts are calling it, would be to launch a centrally managed CBDC. Not only would that turn central banks into retail banks; it also could undermine many of the central tenets of the global financial system. Chief among these, at least in free-market economies, is that there should be a safety gap between central banks, the market, people, and their money.

###With a CBDC, central banks would have a backdoor directly into your bank account, as well as the means to monitor every digital transaction made. At a time when open competitive global markets are building on third-generation blockchains and fast-evolving mobile and e-money standards, this is no time to engage in such privacy-jeopardizing experiments.

Considering the risks, the Fed would be well advised not to rush ahead with launching a CBDC, especially not when the dollar is already the most widely referenced asset for stablecoins and the broader fintech ecosystem that is emerging around the world. Ironically, despite all the histrionics over the threat that cryptocurrencies will disintermediate the financial system, destabilize markets, and circumvent compliance rules to prevent financial crime, the crypto industry is pulling banking into the twenty-first century. The big question for this new era is whether it will be open to everyone.

In this new world, there are fewer bank holidays and more options; and in the case of new-generation trusted digital currencies, sound regulation and bank custody of the underlying reference assets are prerequisites for operating. In this way, the dynamic and competitive US crypto economy is protecting both the two-tiered banking system and the reliance on the dollar. Working fully within the US regulatory perimeter, some breakthrough firms are achieving meteoric public offerings in US capital markets, which themselves are being transformed by programmable money and DeFi. At $86 billion, Coinbase’s direct listing made it the most valuable exchange in the US – more valuable even than the 173-year-old CME Group, which gave cryptocurrencies a mainstay position in the US by offering Bitcoin futures in 2017.

In the crypto industry’s next wave, we will see more bridges being built to increase adoption by merchants and retailers globally; the underlying technology – blockchain – will fade deeper into the background, becoming simply another part of the foundation of the global financial system. We will see much-needed competition in global remittance corridors that have long been subjected to monopolistic or duopolistic conditions, heavy tolls, and slow service for the people who need low-cost, trusted, real-time financial settlements the most.

Digital currencies will also usher in a world of programmable money, by unlocking one blockchain technology’s untapped capabilities: machine-to-machine financial ledgering. JPMorgan’s blockchain unit recently executed a test-run transaction between satellites in orbit using this technology. This sets the stage for seamless payments from all kinds of connected devices, from smart refrigerators to autonomous vehicles. The implications are far-reaching, as are the opportunities to make financial exchanges more transparent, auditable, and accessible – traits that are increasingly creating exponential gains in financial crime compliance for blockchain-based transactions.

All law-abiding people should have access to financial services and the global financial system, regardless of where they live. The best way to uphold that basic right is through trusted digital currencies and blockchain-based payment systems operating on digital public goods (like the internet itself). These are among the most powerful tools that free-market economies and liberal democracies have against the forces of authoritarianism, economic nationalism, and retrenchment. Embracing digital currencies, appropriately regulating the sector, and enabling thousands of flowers to keep blooming from US financial soil can lift people and entire countries into new forms of prosperity.

The US was once dismissed as a renewable-energy laggard and as the country that mothballed its space program; but it is now playing host to the leading innovators and firms in both markets. The same holds true for the future of financial services and payments. As a foundational technology second only to the internet, blockchain will remain a leading protagonist in the story – and so, too, will the dollar.

CryptoCurrency,Greed in crypto will enable more government regulations,"I don't really pay attention to FUD but one thing that's been hard to ignore is the recent Defi exploits and Binance investigations. 

First there are the Binance probes by a few countries, the  [latest](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-01/singapore-to-follow-up-with-binance-in-wake-of-global-crackdown) of which is by Singapore. Looking into it, it seems that part of it is because Binance wasn't satisfied with trading crypto, so they expanded into stock tokens. This led to government investigations because of the similarity to stocks, which are regulated. And as countries call for investigations, it prompts more countries to do the same.

Then there are the Defi exploits. Because of the copy and paste nature of many projects and the rush to get them live (greed), it leads to their getting exploited. Between january and april this year, $156 million was  [lost](https://decrypt.co/70690/defi-hacks-2021-ciphertrace-report) in Defi exploits, and that's not including the losses from Iron Finance or Safedollar.

Im also not a fan of the gambling features in Defi. For example Pancakeswap's prediction and lottery. Gambling online is regulated in many countries, so this could attract government attention down the line.

I am optimistic about the future of crypto but it feels like the companies/projects dont care about government crackdowns as long as they make a profit before it happens.",cryptocurrency

bonds,Target Bond Funds- current potential problems?,"Interest rates are so low, I am looking for a way to diversify risk with corporate short to medium term ETFs, yet protect myself from the rising interest rate curve that looks inevitable. I have searched through the many target year ETFs, as this seems like a way to minimize this risk, as most simply hold the bonds in their portfolio until they come due in the target year, than hold them in money market funds until the end of that year and cash out.

The problem I see is, all the ETF target funds portfolio's now have bonds with average values well over $100 (par) in them. Even the shorter term funds have average prices of $104-108. So, while they may be getting slightly higher than market yields right now, won't their final asset values be less as these bonds gradually go down in value to their $100 par value at maturity? How could you tell what the total return in these funds would be if held to the target date?",finance

personalfinance,Navy Federal refi - I am now 6 months in still with no closing date,"This is a vent and a warning to others NOT to use NFCU for a mortgage REFI. I started a mortgage refi (rate of 2.5%) submitting my initial supporting documents on 28 December. They kept kicking the closing date down the road (initially April) and yesterday I'm told I need to REDO the termite inspection because it is over 90 days old. And the never requested my tax info for 2019, 2020 (I submitted the IRS permission slip January 2021) - they are asking for me to resign a new IRS tax verification form (so they obviously never did anything with the original in 6 months). I have since researched NFCU online and they have multiple complaints online for excessively long times for REFI.

personalfinance,Cash Out Refinance - Am I making the right decision?,"Hello all, I believe this is my first post as I am usually the last person to ask for help. I just want to make sure that I am thinking straight before I commit to this deal. Long story short my wife and I bought a house in April 2020 for 215k and now it appraised for 265k and I am wanting to do a cash our refinance. 

Details:

Bought - 215k @ 3.5% (30yr)  
Owe- $168k  
Appraised - 265k  
Refi Rate - 212k @ 3.375% (30yr)  
Payments will go from $1260 to $1480 (fits our budget fine)

After closing costs and all that it looks like we would pocket about 36k. ($7700 in closing costs sounds high and I have reached out for more clarity on these. $3300 is in prepaids for interest and taxes and such but I feel that should already be in my escrow.)

My thoughts are:

We would still have 20%+ equity in the house and worst case we still are financing less than what we originally bought it for (212 vs 215) the house is fully remodeled and we would never have any trouble selling it but plan to be here for a very long time (20+ years). Yes we do lose 1 year on paying off our mortgage but we also reduce the interest rate a bit.

I’m very much a numbers guy when it comes to debt and personal finance. If I can earn 6-8% return on a long term investment I am not worried about any debts under 4%. 

Current financial situation: Combined income is about 110k/yr and we are debt free minus about 22k in student loans (10k at about 4.5%, 12k at about 3.75%) with two paid off cars. However, in the near future I do plan to replace one of them. We also have a sufficient emergency fund and max out our roths every year on top of some 401k contributions through work.

Possible plans for the 36k include putting about 5k aside for a new roof (matches 5k already saved and should cover the roof but that is still 2-3 years out). Paying off the student loans above 4% (10k worth) or maybe all of them. (I’m hesitant to do this immediately given the current administration and talks about paying off some student loans). I also have been dreaming for a long time of getting into real estate investments and owning some rental properties so a large portion may go toward that if I can get the wife on board. If there is any left over it would likely go to the new vehicle I mentioned previously (However vehicle loans are usually under 4% so again Ill play the numbers).

Any and all input is truly appreciated and thanks in advance! I really struggle when it comes to mortgages and don’t want to regret this for the next 30 years.",finance

solar,Quotes and financing question,"Hello - I've been learning a lot from this sub as I look into solar in the front range area of Colorado. I've got three quotes so far (all of these are before site inspection) and, interestingly, Sunpower is the cheapest per watt, but their financing suggestion (I'm looking at a 20 year loan) is a much hire interest rate. The Sunpower company I'm looking at is IPS and they have quoted financing at 5.74%. Other companies (Sunrun, Namaste) are between 1-2%. Sunpower's explanation is that ""the other companies build in financing costs into their quotes so they can offer a lower APR.""

The result is that Sunpower comes out as most expensive over the life of the loan. I'm wondering if this sounds odd to anyone and is the obvious idea that I should look for financing through a HELOC to take advantage of Sunpower's lower overall cost and escape their higher financing?

Quotes are:

(SP) 6.48kW system (9174W estimated production) / $22,090 ($3.41/W)

(SR) 6.12kW system (8886W estimated production) / $24,419 ($3.99/W)

personalfinance,Refinancing worth it?,"Hello all, so just as the title says I'm looking to refinance my mortgage. I currently owe $119,472.29, financed for $188,500 in 2017 at 4.5% interest and removed my PMI back in 2018. I have a payment of $1,403.62 and give $200 towards principal. A breakdown of where my money goes is $476.11 towards principal, $453.10 towards interest and $476.27 towards escrow. 

I'm looking to refinance now that interest rates are low hopefully anywhere between 2.85% and 3.5% and hopefully $5000 towards closing cost. I'm mostly doing this so my payments can lower in case of an emergency. My wife and I are expecting and that's gonna be our first child so that's something new in my life I'd like to be prepared for. 

I know 30 years is slightly higher interest rate as opposed to 20 or 15 years. I plan on keeping my current payments if not possibly give a bit more if I can, or if life gets rough then the lower payments would definitely be better. Should I refinance or stay where I'm at?

Any advice is greatly appreciated.",finance

personalfinance,Is a cash out-refinance to clear CC debt a good idea?,"While I wasn't in the BEST place financially, I decided to buy a house last December with 5% down in a very hot market (Austin) because I was fairly sure that it was going to be my last opportunity to do it without a significant windfall. While I feel like it's paid off, the Redfin estimate has gone up $90K since I bought it, a lot of house and non-house emergencies have come up in the intervening time, and I've gone through the savings I had left and have about $15K on credit cards. I had originally planned on waiting a year or two to refinance and do some renovations and fix up an old ADU in the back to start generating income on it, I'm now wondering if it would be a better idea to just refinance now while interest rates are still pretty low, clear out my CC debt and have a decent emergency fund again.  


I have $270K on the mortgage and Redfin estimates that it's worth about $380K, which I think is fairly accurate. I've also had new siding installed because it was starting to rot when I bought it, which I assume will help with appraisal. This is especially appealing since my payment would  stay about the same since I'd be dropping PMI.",finance

personalfinance,What professionals can I actually trust to evaluate my financial situation?,"Hello! 

I've been in the workforce for approximately 4 years, making 2 job hops that ultimately raised my salary by over 50% in this time. Because of this I've saved up quite a bit and I want to plan for early retirement and success but I honestly have no clue who to turn to. 

I've essentially read this subreddit and a few blogs on how to lay out my money. Essentially I have the following...

* TSP- 20k - essentially in an equivalent target date fund (I broke out the money myself as opposed to the target fund and I'll balance it over time, I'll max this out in the next 1-2 years, right now I'm inputting 15% which is approx 15k) 

* Roth IRA - 51k - mostly in index funds and blue chip growth funds(85%), some in bonds (15%) (max every year on Jan 1) 

* Rollover IRA - 35k - mostly in index funds and blue chip growth funds(90%), some in bonds (10%)

* Bank Account - 30k - just sitting in my bank account - this is my 9-12 month survival cash

* Individual Broker - 10k - once I hit 40k in my bank account I felt I needed to let some it grow somewhere, I essentially have it all invested in the same way as my IRAs (no clue if that's right or not)

I've been a federal government employee for just over 1 year, so I've got a long way to go, I just turned 29 years old. 

By my calculation I'm sitting on just under 150k, plus I've got ~75k in equity in the house. 

Who is the right person to sit down and plan so I don't make any major mistakes? I feel like I've gotten ridiculously lucky so far, I spent the first 2 years of my working life just putting all my money into FBGRX and it exploded, so now I feel like I have too much money to screw around with and with how high the market is, I'm panicking!

personalfinance,Unsure What to Do with Savings,"Hey everyone, I have recently noticed just how stagnant the savings in my bank account really are. After I graduated high school a couple of years ago, I decided to work for a year before attending my local college. I had very few monetary commitments at that time. As a result, I was able to save over $10,000 coming out of that job. I've been in college a little over a year at this point with no student-loan debt or debt of any other kind. The college has so far been paid by a mixture of these savings, grants, and scholarships. Currently, I do still live in my parents' house. I have no house or car payments, but I have some expenditures (mostly consisting of gas money to drive over an hour to the community college I attend). Since I have relatively few commitments now, I've been wondering if I should consider partially investing my savings, now totaling about $8,500. Unfortunately, establishing an IRA doesn't seem to be an option since I would have needed to open this account in the tax year in which I was working. I'm considering opening an investment account anyway since I highly doubt that I'll be making enough with it to incur a capital gains tax at the federal level. However, investing part of my savings with my current timetable feels like it could be quite speculative. I'm sure that I will be working in about four years. By this time, I really have no idea if I could make enough money to justify the investment now whether it be with some kind of index fund, CD, or anything else. I'm 20 right now.

&amp;#x200B;

Should I invest part of my savings? I'm very new at all of this and just trying to make sure that I make the best decisions now while it's early. Thanks for the help.",finance
stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Friday, July 2, 2021. Please enjoy!","**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, July 2, 2021**

Stocks rose once again, with the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Nasdaq (QQQ) both recording new intraday highs amid the continued push by technology stocks. The Dow Jones (DIA) rose as well, but continued to lag behind the other two indexes. Market participants are encouraged by the June Jobs Report, which showed payroll gains rise more than expected. 

Today, the US Department of Labor released the Job June report, which showed a stronger-than-expected acceleration in hiring, with non-farm payrolls rising by 850,000, the sixth straight month of gains. The unemployment rate however, ticked slightly higher to 5.9%. Here are the numbers

* **Change in non-farm payrolls:** 850,000 vs. 720,000 expected and an upwardly revised 583,000 in May
* **Unemployment rate:** 5.9% vs. 5.6% expected and 5.8% in May 
* **Average hourly earnings, month-over-month:** 0.3% vs. 0.3% expected and a downwardly revised 0.4% in May
* **Average hourly earnings, year-over-year:** 3.6% vs. 3.6% expected and a downwardly revised 1.9% in May

President Biden said of the report, “This is historic progress, pulling our economy out of the worst crisis in 100 years, driven in part by our dramatic progress in vaccinating our nation and beating back the pandemic. Today, the US is the only major advanced economy where the OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) projections of future output are higher today than they were in January 2020 before the pandemic hit.”

Emily Roland, co-Chief Investment Strategist at John Hancock Investment Management said of the report, “This is the Goldilocks Report that the market was looking for today. You had a nice print here of 850,000 jobs being added, wage pressure remaining – I wouldn't call them necessarily contained – but surprising here on the downside versus consensus estimates. So this is telling us right now that economic growth is continuing to accelerate here, the jobs market is continuing to heal. We're making progress here in terms of what the Fed has set out to do, which is in order to get unemployment down, they're going to let inflation run a little bit hot here. Not too hot, not too cold – this is just what the market wants.""

This Job Report will give market participants a better idea as to the timing of the Federal Reserve’s next monetary policy. For now, the Fed has so far kept in place both of its key pandemic-era policies - quantitative easing at a clip of $120 billion a month and near-zero interest rates. However, the Fed has consistently said they are looking for a “string” of strong jobs reports, like the one this month before any adjustments to the current policy is made. If the Jobs Report continues being especially strong in the months ahead, it could force the Fed to taper quantitative easing earlier than originally telegraphed. I have said  before in the past I expect the Fed to begin tapering QE towards the end of the year and am not worried about that at all. For starters, the market has historically reacted very little to changes in QE ([see the 2013 Taper Tantrum here)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taper-tantrum.asp), it’s changes in the interest rate that really drive the market, and second, the Fed is expected to taper slowly, making any changes gradual.

**Highlights**

* Shares of AMC pulled back slightly after financial firm Iceberg Research announced they have opened a short position. Honestly, I have no idea why they did this, only opening themselves up to becoming WSB's next target. Will be interesting to see what happens moving forward.
* More bad news for Lordstown Motors, who have already been the subject of a short report that saw the company admit they had inflated the importance of preorders for the electric pickup truck and forced the CEO to leave. Now, the Justice Department has announced it is opening a probe into the company to investigate comments made by executives and the way the company represented its pre orders to shareholders. The whole EV market was down today in sympathy. 
* Tesla (TSLA) recorded its fifth straight quarter of vehicle delivery growth. In Q2, the company delivered 201,250 vehicles, missing expectations for 204,160, according to Bloomberg consensus data**,** but more than double the 90,891 vehicles delivered in the same period a year ago.
* The U.S. Federal Trade Commission filed a proposed consent order to settle antitrust charges against semiconductor maker Broadcom Inc, the agency said in a statement on Friday. The consent order requires Broadcom to stop demanding that its customers buy components mostly or only from Broadcom. The company responded, “While we disagree that our actions violated the law and disagree with the FTC’s characterizations of our business, we look forward to putting this matter behind us.""

&gt;Stocks rose on Friday and the S&amp;P 500 hit another record high after the June jobs report showed an accelerating recovery for the U.S. labor market.  
&gt;  
&gt;The broad market index rose 0.75% to 4,352.34, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.81% to notch its own record at 14,639.33. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 152.82 points to close at 34,786.35. The S&amp;P 500 has now risen for seven consecutive sessions, its longest winning streak since August.  
&gt;  
&gt;Solid moves by major tech stocks helped support the overall market on Friday, with shares of Apple and Salesforce rising by nearly 2% and 1.3%, respectively. Microsoft jumped 2.2%.  
&gt;  
&gt;For the week, the Nasdaq Composite rose nearly 2%, while the S&amp;P 500 and Dow climbed 1.7% and 1%, respectively. Several sectors closed at record levels on Friday, including tech and health care.  
&gt;  
&gt;The strong week on Wall Street was spurred by a string of solid economic reports, capped by a better-than-expected jobs report on Friday morning.  
&gt;  
&gt;The economy [added 850,000 jobs last month](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/02/jobs-report-june-2021.html), according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones were expecting an addition of 706,000. The print topped the revised 583,000 jobs created in May.  
&gt;  
&gt;“This is a strong report and should be taken as a sign of things to come for an accelerating labor market,” Aberdeen Standard Investments deputy chief economist James McCann said in a note.  
&gt;  
&gt;Angelo Kourkafas, an investment strategist at Edward Jones, said that the report showed solid growth but wouldn’t change the Fed’s policy path, hitting a sweet spot for markets.  
&gt;  
&gt;“I think it was one of these goldilocks-type of reports, because hiring accelerated -- which is a positive sign for the second half and the recovery -- but not so much that it would trigger a reaction of an accelerated timeline for the Federal Reserve to start tapering,” Kourkafas said.  
&gt;  
&gt;In addition to the job gains, average hourly wages rose 0.3% for the month and are up 3.6% year over year, matching expectations.  
&gt;  
&gt;Goldman Sachs chief economist Jan Hatzius said that the report eased concerns about a labor shortage.  
&gt;  
&gt;“I think we also learned that the explanations for the weaker numbers from April and May -- namely that seasonal probably weighing on job growth and probably some impact from the unemployment benefits on labor supply -- that those were pretty good explanations. So I think it was reassuring, in that sense,” Hatzius said on CNBC’s “[Squawk on the Street](https://www.cnbc.com/squawk-on-the-street/),” adding that the unemployment rate coming in higher than expected showed that the recovery still had a long way to go.  
&gt;  
&gt;The S&amp;P 500 has now risen in five of the past six weeks, while the Nasdaq has gained in six of the past seven weeks.  
&gt;  
&gt;Even with the recent strength for stocks, market strategists say that uncertainty about the future of the Fed’s asset purchases and the upcoming earnings season could keep stocks from making major gains in the near term.  
&gt;  
&gt;“The market is still very much concerned about the Fed’s reaction function,” said Max Gokhman, head of asset allocation at Pacific Life Fund Advisors, adding that he thought there was still a lot of slack in the labor market.  
&gt;  
&gt;One weak spot for the markets this week was small caps, as the Russell 2000 slipped 1% on Friday to finish negative for the week.

CryptoCurrency,"Is interest earned on stablecoin deposits really taxed at a LOWER rate than any interest one might earn from currency in a traditional savings account, despite having a higher APR by orders of magnitude?","Ok, so what I have been looking at lately has been the interest rates on stable coins as well as my own savings account which I keep my emergency fund in. When I started it 4 years ago it was considered pretty decent with 2.4%. Most recently I checked and it is 0.4%, only a sixth of what it was, and even then was not a lot. 

I looked at the interest rates for stablecoins out there, and it's quite eye openning. Can range from 5-12% depending on company/platform, and while there can be some fees for converting cash to crypto (and some have fees per cash out), overall it is still more than what I would make on basic bank interest rates.

But the real surprise was when I looked at the tax rates for interest earned on stablecoins vs. regular savings account interest. Per https://www.fidelity.com/tax-information/tax-topics/interest-income#:~:text=Typically%2C%20most%20interest%20is%20taxed,as%20checking%20and%20savings%20accounts.&amp;text=Interest%20on%20U.S.%20obligations%20(except,not%20at%20the%20state%20level) , taxes on savings accounts are taxed at your current tax rate. From the IRS crypto guidelines that I know, crypto is subject to capital gains taxes of 30% within a year, 15% for holdings longer than that. 

Doing the math, assuming one keeps $10k in the 0.4% bank account, you would earn $40 a year. Depending on the tax rate, say it's 21%, that means at the end of the year you would be able to keep $31.60 effectively. Putting that $10k into stable coins tho, that could bring you between $500-1200 in value a year. Even assuming the 30% tax rate, that's still $350-840, and if you can hold it for longer than a year it could be between $425-1020. 

While I'm not immune to the fact that there are still fees involved in conversion and sometimes withdrawal, even if those fees eat up to half your interest revenue that still nets you between $175-510 per year on your interest rates per $10k. That's over 5.5x what you would make on your traditional bank account at its lowest interest rate on stablecoins, not even getting into the volatility of crypto at all.

That means for many people, assuming they just let it ride and don't have to convert or cash it out, if they hold longer than a year the effective tax rate on their stablecoin interest account could be less than the tax rate one might have to pay on traditional bank account interest, while many being orders of magnitude higher!

After doing the math which seems very promising, I am just concerned about anything I may have overlooked, and am a bit concerned about the saying ""if it looks too good to be true, it probably is"". So, is there anything that I have not thought of...?",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Paying off CC Debt - Need Advice,"Hey all. I have 4 CCs to pay off and am trying to figure out how to tackle it. They all basically have the same interest rate (except one CC3 is 1% point lower) so it's not really a matter of picking snowball or avalanche methods....  


CC1 - $30k

CC2 - $3k

CC3 - $3k

CC4 - $10k  


Right now I can put $10k towards the $30k or just pay off CC4. they have the same interest rate. It seems like it doesn't matter which one I do, correct? I think if I put it towards the $30k and then eventually pay that off the other ones will seem pretty easy to take care of.

personalfinance,Rebuilding credit score: Options? [USA],"Hi all,

I'm a somewhat recent college graduate. When I graduated, I signed up for a credit card through a federal credit union to build my credit score, and put a small monthly subscription on it, not using it in any other way. I screwed up during the pandemic and my credit score went down quite a bit. Moved back to my home country to spend about half of the pandemic with family, during this time my federal credit union went through some changes and got bought(?) by Elan Financial Services and the website + interface for online transactions changed. My automatic payments weren't happening and I could not sign in to my account for a long time and my credit union office decided to only operate by appointment. I called my credit union office a few times to get assistance through phone but could not reach people. A bunch of stuff was happening in my life during this time and I did not pay my credit card debt for several months. When I returned to the country, I paid it off but apparently they closed my credit account. Turns out I could have directly contacted Elan customer service, though, and I have no idea why I didn't think of it at the time because when I did, they took care of the payment really quickly.

There was an uptick in my credit score when I paid off my loan but of course it is still quite low because: (1) this was my only credit card, (2) I didn't pay off my debt for a long time and (3) now I have a closed account on my record.

I know I messed up and I know I should be a lot more careful in the future. But I need some advice on how to move forward now. CreditKarma seems to think a good option would be to open up a **secured credit card**, where I deposit a certain amount, like 200 USD ahead of time, get a credit card with 200 USD limit, put a small charge on it (like a monthly Netflix subscription or something) and set automated payments to build up my credit score. Once I rebuild my score a little bit, I'd apply for a real credit card (I don't think I'd be approved now and I don't know if I could currently afford a hard inquiry, anyway). When I discussed this with a friend, he told me that this was likely a bad idea because these cards were people who could not be trusted with paying off their debt (well, based on my recent history, I guess I am in that category currently :/) and likely had too many penalties. However, I looked around and looks like there are a few secured cards that are not too bad, such as: 

\- *Discover It Secured Card* has no annual fee and reports to the three major credit bureaus. Has 22.99% APR.  
\- *OpenSky Secured Credit Visa Card* has 35$ annual fee (which isn't ideal but at this point it is worth rebuilding my score, I think) and has no hard inquiry when opening an account (I think Discover It does). 17.39% APR  
\- *First Progress Platinum Elite Mastercard Secured Credit Card* has no hard inquiry either, with $29 annual fee and 19.99% APR

What do you think about secured credit cards?  What are the pros and cons? If you think it's a good idea, what cards/banks etc would you suggest? Do you have other ideas for rebuilding my credit score? 

I have also looked into two other options: **(1) a secured loan** and **(2) reporting utility bills** etc to credit bureaus. Apparently my federal credit union offers something like a credit builder loan so I could probably talk to them, but I don't quite understand how it works yet. I actually consistently pay my rent and utility bills on time, so I looked into potential services for reporting my utility bills but I am not sure what organization to trust. Some of the options seemed to be Self, Experian, and LevelCredit but my impression of them is that I'd need to pay more out of pocket to use them compared to secured credit cards.",finance
stocks,"Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning July 5th, 2021","Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning July 5th, 2021.

# **Fed could be a surprise catalyst for the markets in holiday week - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/02/fed-could-be-a-surprise-catalyst-for-markets-in-holiday-week-.html)**
*****
&gt; The quiet holiday week ahead could hold some fireworks for investors if the Federal Reserve reveals its thinking on its bond buying program.
*****
&gt; The four-day trading week could see stocks drift, after hitting new highs this past week. The closely watched 10-year Treasury yield has held under 1.5%, a positive for tech which outperformed with a 3.2% gain for the week.
*****
&gt; There are very few economic reports of note, aside from ISM services data on Tuesday. But the Fed’s minutes from its last meeting will be released Wednesday afternoon, and there is potential for the market to learn more about the central bank’s behind-the-scenes discussions on winding down its quantitative easing program.
*****
&gt; “Our base case is that rates drift higher, but in order to that get that move higher you need a catalyst to get there,” said Brian Daingerfield, head of G10 FX strategy Americas at NatWest Markets. “Either the Fed has to move forward aggressively on tapering, or you have to get the data really rocking, and you don’t have either.”
*****
&gt; Friday’s report that 850,000 jobs were added in June was better than expected. However, the unemployment rate missed expectations after rising by 0.1 percentage points to 5.9%. Economists expected the rate to fall to 5.6%. The report was not seen as strong enough to encourage the Fed to step away sooner from its easy policies. It was, however, seen as a positive — yet largely incomplete — picture of the labor market.
*****
&gt; Daingerfield said there is the potential for the Fed’s June meeting minutes to surprise the market, similar to the way April minutes did.
*****
&gt; “Remember, Powell said they were not talking about talking about tapering,” he said, referring to Fed Chairman Jerome Powell’s comments right after the April meeting. “Remember, Powell was very dismissive, and then the minutes revealed a kind of drift to the committee.”
*****
&gt; The April meeting minutes did surprise investors when they noted that “a number of participants” said it would be appropriate to begin discussing tapering bond purchases at upcoming meetings if the economy continues to make rapid progress. After the June meeting, Powell revealed early stage discussions about paring back bond buying. The Fed also presented a new forecast that included two rate hikes in 2023, where there were none indicated before.
*****
&gt; The market is highly sensitive to details about the Fed’s bond purchase program since the ending to that measure would be open the door for the central bank to raise interest rates. The low-rate environment has been the kindling behind the stock market’s robust gains since the Fed went all out to help the economy get through the pandemic. Cutting back on the monthly $120 billion bond purchases would be the first rollback of those extraordinary measures.
*****
&gt; “There’s a lot we don’t know about the Fed’s thinking about tapering,” Daingerfield said. He said key information would be when it plans to start, how rapidly it will move to wind down the program and how it decides to break down its current monthly purchases of $80 billion in Treasurys and $40 billion in mortgage securities.
*****
&gt; “These details really do matter. Did they get into that conversation at all about details? The more detail they discussed, the more likely it is they are looking to move forward sooner,” Daingerfield said. Fed watchers widely expect more details about tapering the bond program around its annual symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming in late August, and then start slowing purchases later this year or early in 2022.
*****
&gt; For now, the positive tone in the bond market has helped stocks. The 10-year yield, which moves opposite price, has fallen from its high of the year of about 1.75%. At that level, technology and growth shares were under pressure.
*****
&gt; But they’ve been making a comeback as rates drift around in a range below 1.6%. The 10-year was at 1.43% Friday, and while the lower rate may help tech stocks, the yield level is a sharp contrast to an economy that was expected to grow at more than 10% in the second quarter.
*****
&gt; That pace is expected to slow, but growth for the year is expected to be robust at more than 7%.
*****
&gt; # Tech transition
&gt; Citi Private Bank chief investment strategist Steven Wieting said that, with the economy peaking, the time is right for investors to begin transitioning to tech and growth shares from the popular cyclical trade.
*****
&gt; “We’re seeing this as all a temporary period of massive distortions, and within a year from now, we’ll be on steadier water,” he said. “I think this is giving people a reason, including us, to move away from just cyclical rebound trades and into some sustainable growth opportunities.”
*****
&gt; Year to date, cyclicals have been some of the better performers. Energy shares are up 44.5% with the rebound in oil prices, and financials have bounced 25.2%. In contrast, S&amp;P 500 growth stocks are up 14.3%, lagging slightly the S&amp;P 500′s 15.5% gain. Tech stocks are up just 14.9% year-to-date.
*****
&gt; One area Wieting now likes is global health care. The S&amp;P 500 health care sector was up 12.5% for the year so far.
*****
&gt; “Health care is a mid-cycle outperformer. Health care is a part of the economy that didn’t fall as hard,” he said. “Earnings and revenues have grown moderately every year since the mid-1980s.” He said the sector has lagged the S&amp;P 500 since the end of 2019 by 10 percentage points, and has a cheap valuation. Big pharma stocks are among the best dividend payers.
*****
&gt; For the major sectors, on a 12-month basis, the cyclical sectors of industrials, materials, and energy have all risen more than 40%, and tech has had a similar 42% gain.
*****
&gt; “The growth stocks have stayed rich. The value stocks have completely caught up with growth stocks in 12-month performance, but the valuation hasn’t been beaten down in growth stocks,” he said. “Gradually we’re going to get more sustained performance out of tech after this period where it flatlined.”
*****
&gt; Wieting said one area that is particularly attractive is cybersecurity, where demand is strong as a “tech spending essential,” but the sector has gone nowhere.
*****
&gt; For instance, the iShares Cybersecurity and Tech ETF IHAK is just below its 52 week high set in January, and the Global X Cybersecurity ETF BUG is trading about a dollar below its February high.
*****
&gt; Wieting said he likes some alternative energy names and companies that are involved in digitization, including fintech.
*****
&gt; He expects the overall stock market to move higher but not at the same rapid clip.
*****
&gt; “We want to start transitioning portfolios away from just rebound plays...We’re transitioning, knowing we’ve captured significant outperformance over the past year with cyclical value. It made people comfortable investing in equities when we could show how cheap they were,” he said.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 ended the week up 1.7% at a record 4,352, while the Dow climbed 1% to 34,786. The Nasdaq was 1.9% higher, ending the week at a record 14,639.

&gt; # Typical July Seasonal Pattern: Bullish Through Mid-Month &amp; Tepid After

&gt; This July has commenced with across the board gains from the major indexes, DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000. Yesterday’s gains are consistent with historical trends for the first trading day of July. Over the past twenty-one years, July has on average begun with respectable gains. The second trading day has been weaker, but after this the major indexes have tended to trend solidly higher through mid-month to around the thirteenth trading day. At this point the major indexes have tended to weaken and trade sideways to lower to finish out the month.

&gt; # Sentiment Has Perked Up

&gt; Sentiment has taken a big step up in the past week. The AAII weekly sentiment survey saw 48.6% of respondents report as bullish this week, up 8.2 percentage points from last week for the highest reading since the week of April 22nd when over half of respondents reported as optimists. Not only is this week's reading ten percentage points above the historical average, but the one-week increase was the largest since an 11.1 percentage point jump during the week of April 8th. Similarly, the Investors Intelligence survey of newsletter writers saw bullish sentiment jump from 56.5% last week to an eight-week high of 59.6%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/07/070121-AAII-Bull.png)**

&gt; Considering bearish sentiment was already muted, that big increase in bullish sentiment was only met with a 1.1 percentage point decline in bearish sentiment. Only 22.2% of respondents reported as bearish this week, the lowest reading since June 10th.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/07/070121-AAII-Bear.png)**

&gt; While bearish sentiment did not experience a particularly large decline, it was an inverse move to bullish sentiment which resulted in the bull-bear spread climbing 9.3 points to the highest level since April 22nd. That means sentiment continues to largely favor the bulls. Prior to the past year, late 2017 and early 2018 was the only other period in recent years that the bull-bear spread was at similar levels to now.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/07/070121-AAII-Spread.png)**

&gt; Given the jump in bullish sentiment did not borrow from bearish sentiment, neutral sentiment took a significant hit this week falling 7.4 percentage points. That was both the biggest one-week decline and marks the lower level in neutral sentiment since April.

&gt; # Market Stronger Day Before than After Independence Day

&gt; Over the last 21 years, the trading day before Independence Day has been stronger than the day after. DJIA and S&amp;P 500 have advanced 66.7% of the time with average gains of 0.13% and 0.11% respectively on the day before. Based upon average performance, NASDAQ and Russell 2000 are slightly softer on the day before, but still lean bullish. On the trading day after Independence Day DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and Russell 2000 have declined more frequently than advanced. DJIA has recorded the fewest number of advances while Russell 2000 has the worst average performance with a 0.10% loss.

&gt; # Stocks Only Going Up In The First Half

&gt; One of the most remarkable aspects of the past six months has been the lack of a significant pullback. The S&amp;P 500 has not seen a 5% pullback since October, and since the start of the year, the most it had fallen from a high was 4.23% from mid-February to March 4th. Besides that and another smaller 4% pullback in May, it has been a one-way trip higher. Looking back through the history of the S&amp;P 500, there are not many other years in which the index went the entire first half without at least a 5% pullback. Below we show the chart of the S&amp;P 500 for each of the 14 years that, like this year, did not experience a pullback of at least 5% in the first half. . As shown, six of these (highlighted in green)—1954, 1958, 1964, 1993, 1995, and most recently 2017—actually did not see a 5% or larger pullback in the second half of the year either.

&gt; As for the other years, the S&amp;P 500 did generally tend to move higher for at least part of the second half, but there have been a range of declines. The year with the largest decline in the second half was 1986 when the index fell 9.42% in September. And that was after a 7.53% decline shortly after the midpoint of the year in the first two weeks of July. The 1959 occurrence similarly saw a 9.17% decline from August through September. While it did not necessarily all happen within the second half of the year, the declines in the final days of the 1961 occurrence actually marked the beginning of a bear market that ultimately would see the S&amp;P 500 fall 23.6% from its late 1961 peak.

personalfinance,Income share agreement to pay for a cross-country move instead of a personal loan,"I just finished grad school got a new job in San Francisco, and I'm looking to borrow about $10k for a cross-country move for my family (the place I'm renting requires 1st month, last month, and deposit equal to 1 month of rent, which is ridiculous but the norm there).

I've never taken a personal loan before. I've heard horror stories of high interest rates and I'm generally very cautious of taking on debt. Are there any lenders that offer an income-based loan, where I can pay back a % of my income instead of a fixed amount each month? Something similar to income share agreements for coding bootcamps, where if things go according to plan, I'll pay back the loan and more with no problem, but if I lose my job or downgrade to a lower paying job, I have some protection.",finance

We are now supposedly a week from closing (was set for June 29th, was confirmed in a voicemail the appraisal was delayed as the builder was not finished on the house and said they were). Now, today Regions sends an updated loan estimate application and want us to sign this, but now our interest rate has shot up to 3.1% in this market. Our house is a total of $236,200 (actually went down from our initial price), my wife and I have great credit (800 and 780), and I even got a very modest raise during these last couple of months which the bank can see as we have sent them our last few paychecks. Are we getting screwed here? Should I tell our loan agent to kick rocks until we get a better rate? Would this drag our close? Since closing has been delayed for almost 4 months now, we are currently homeless living in a hotel. Really appreciate any help or insight. Geography is Florida if that helps.",finance
personalfinance,I'm 20 and have money burning in my bank account. I need to invest it but I don't know how to plan.,"I'm a soon-to-be junior in college, 20 years old, with a lot of money in my bank account. No student loans because scholarships more than cover my college expenses including housing and dining. I know that I need to start investing in an IRA and other things, but I don't know how to allocate my money.

Here's a breakdown of my current financial situation:

## Current net worth

Checking+Savings account balance: $26,200

M1 Finance portfolio value: $1,700   
\- 70% is currently in a handful of tech stocks that I was interested in, and 30% is their premade Aggressive portfolio with a bunch of Vanguard ETFs

## Income

I expect to make roughly $1,600 more from working this summer. I also expect to receive $2,200 in scholarship overflow the coming semester. That's after tuition, room, and board are paid for.

All of this income is figured after federal and state income tax. I used the IRS withholding estimator to set my withholding for paychecks this summer, also taking into account the taxable portion of my scholarships. I just realized my state withholding is incorrectly still at $0, so I am reducing my wages by the amount I owed last year as an estimate until I figure out how much I need to withhold.

## Expenses

As I mentioned above, tuition, room, and board are accounted for in the scholarship overflow so I won't mention them here. The other expenses I have are:

Monthly subscriptions (Cell plan, Spotify, YNAB): ~$35/mo

Other spending (eating out, shopping, etc.): ~$300/mo

## Savings goals

This is probably the section where I need the most help and I think this determines how I should allocate my money. A lot of these are uncertain and arbitrary for me because I don't really know what my life goals are right now.

### Short-term (&lt;1yr)

Summer Housing: $2,300
\- I am doing summer research at my school, and the bill is due this month.

Emergency Fund: $7,500
\- Do I need this much at the stage of life I'm in right now when I can fall back on my parents? What do I consider?

Plane ticket for family trip overseas: $2,000
\- We are trying to see my dad's family this winter, and I said that I could pay my ticket if needed. This is mostly because I feel like I owe them, since a lot of my wealth comes from them saving up for me since I was young. My mom says she doesn't plan on me needing to pay for my ticket, but maybe I should hold onto this just in case?

New laptop: $1,200
\- I've been thinking about getting a new laptop for a while. The thing is I bet I could do without it; my current one is a MacBook Pro from 2012 and it's still decent hardware. So I don't know about this category.

Tablet: $600
\- A tablet is also on my wishlist but also... I could do without. So I don't know about this category either.

### Mid-term (1-5yrs)

Grad school: ???
\- I am interested in pursuing a PhD but I don't know how much I should be saving right now for it. If I decide to stay at the school I'm at, it appears very likely from talking with other grad students in my field that I would be able to get my tuition paid, plus about $20,000 per year (if I heard them right). This would be through being a GTA or GRA, which I (think) I'm willing to do. On the other hand, what if I want to go somewhere else? How do I figure out how much I would need to save right now for this scenario? I guess I shouldn't be completely opposed to taking out loans if it allowed me to go to a school I really wanted to go to. My grandma also has $20,000 sitting in a 529 plan that I should be able to use for grad school if needed.

Road Bike: $1,200

Travel: $1,200
\- I imagine that sometime in the future I'm gonna have the opportunity to go on a trip with friends or something. Maybe I should be more stingy and set less money aside for that?

Car down payment: $6,000
\- My car is a family car from 2000 and my parents think it might not last much longer after I finish undergrad. So I figure I'll need a car. At first I was thinking about buying a new car... but now I wonder, should I save money by buying used/preowned? How much should I save for this category?

Desktop computer: $1,200
\- My friends are into gaming and part of me wants to be a part of that, because I used to love PC gaming... but part of me also wants to spend my time doing other things. So not sure about this category either.

### Long-term (&gt;5yrs)

Buy a house: ???

Retirement: ???

## TL;DR

I have a lot of money and I don't know what to do with it. The categories that I have a very high certainty of a need for are summer housing, my emergency fund, and grad school, but I don't really know how much I should save for these. Other categories are things that I could live without but are on a sort of weak wishlist. Before I lock all of my money in an IRA and other high-risk investments, I'm not sure how to invest money for my near-future goals in a way that reflects my uncertainty about them.",finance

personalfinance,What to do with a parent's retirement when it's just cash in their checking account?,"My mom's retirement is her social security and my deceased father's pension. Under $3k/month combined. 

She has no debt, house is paid off, and $170k in cash between her checking and savings accounts. My dad ""ran the finances"" (she always did the taxes) and he had a strictly ""it's in cash or it doesn't exist"" mindset. A few months after he died, for example, we found $8k stuffed into a sock buried in the back of a filing cabinet in the basement.

The closest he got to an investment account was a couple of CDs that mature next year. 

She's not really a whole lot different in her mind set. She's perfectly content letting the money sit in her savings account getting 0.05% interest because then she doesn't have to worry about it, *it's safe.*

But I want to make sure that she's not going to just run herself out of money over the next 20-30 years if she has some bad medical expenses come up or something. What's a good, extremely low risk and low effort step she can take to protect herself?

She doesn't really spend money much herself, just her monthly bills like netflix, food, eating out, but she does want to remodel her house in the next year or two which is going to be 20-30k probably.",finance

personalfinance,Refinance Possibility...,"So we bought a house about a year ago on a great interest rate. Were sitting on a 30 year at 2.65%.

The house has appreciated approximately 10-15% since we purchased it.

We have been receiving offers to refi on a 15 year mortgage for approximately 1.8%.

Due to my job, I am nearly guaranteed to get some decent pay bumps over the next 6-8 months. About 15%.

Now here's the crazy idea...

Refi the house for the appreciated amount on a 15 year note and then use the ""profit"" to cover the difference in mortgage until my pay increase hits. 

I'm only considering this because the interest rate is so low. I do understand that the fed announced that interest rates are not supposed to rise much until the end of 2023.

CryptoCurrency,"Making bad decisions, sunk cost fallacy, and cutting losses/avoiding the fallacy","So, psychologically, we do not like to admit to ourselves when we f\*\*\* up. Sometimes this causes us to make worse subsequent decisions because in the short term it makes us feel worse to right a wrong at a cost than to ignore the problem and let the losses get bigger on the longer term.

&amp;#x200B;

Today I f\*\*\*ed up, however my f\*\*\*up was quite controlled. Small amount of money, nothing too bad.

&amp;#x200B;

I saw the airdrop for an ERC-20 coin I won't name but it is one of those DeFi/DEX coins that promise a lot of returns etc. Obviously having seen several other DeFi/DEX coins skyrocket, I became greedy.

&amp;#x200B;

I exchanged some of my alts to ETH to be able to get some of that coin, about $100 worth, then I exchanged $75 worth of said ETH to that coin.

&amp;#x200B;

Then it dawned on me, WTF! I did not do any research.

&amp;#x200B;

Research turned up a lot of unfavourable information, no, not FUD. Like a football field full of red flags.

&amp;#x200B;

Examples:

* Not a single reddit post about that coin since 2018.
* Airdrop YEARS after the launch? Sounds a bit suss.
* All reviews show a lot of marketing and not much in terms of whitepaper, dev team details, or any evidence they can back their claims with code.

&amp;#x200B;

Then I thought. Stuff it, I do not have much to lose anyway, and I already had to pay some money to get the ETH, transfer it around (gas fees and whatnot from exchange to Ledger to the other DeFi platform that swaps that coin for ETH).

&amp;#x200B;

Then I remembered. This is how rug pulls happen. Not just FOMO, it's the sunk cost fallacy.

&amp;#x200B;

 [Sunk cost - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_cost#Psychological_factors) 

&amp;#x200B;

We all get into WORSE losses trying to avoid smaller losses. Examples:

&amp;#x200B;

* People staying in terrible/abusive relationships because of time/money/effort/emotion already invested despite the fact that they will lose far more if they stay than if they break up, and that the longer they wait, the worse the breakup.
* You buy a sandwich/meal/fast food/drink/whatever, and it tastes like crap but you keep eating it anyway despite barely standing it because you already paid for it.
* You sign up for a course, attend a few classes then realise this is not for you, but continue anyway because of time and/or money spent.
* You do a bad margin trade decision (go long and prices badly drop or vice versa) and instead of cutting your losses you keep adding funds to the position which doesn't look like it is going to bounce back to to recover and/or make profits.
* You buy a coin then realise that it has a super high potential of being a rug pull.

&amp;#x200B;

**DISCLAIMER: I am not saying that at the first sign of loss/drop of prices you should sell and cut your losses, this is completely different and in a market that is inherently volatile this is a bad way of managing your portfolio. I strictly am talking about if you unwittingly/out of FOMO bought a shitcoin then realised it was a shitcoin.**

&amp;#x200B;

What have I done?

&amp;#x200B;

Between the ETH gas fees (transfer from exchange to own wallet then to swap, swapping back then transferring back) as well as the buy-sale spread in my swap, I lost about $12 worth of ETH out of $100 worth of ETH.

&amp;#x200B;

Bad move? Yes

Big loss? No

Better lose $12 than lose a $100? Absolutely

Lessons learned? 

&amp;#x200B;

1- NEVER BUY A COIN OUT OF FOMO. ALWAYS DYOR FIRST (which I usually do, but I believe I was caught in an impulsive moment).

2- CUT YOUR LOSSES AND DON'T GO SAYING ""IT MAY SKYROCKET!"" when it obviously WILL TANK and you will lose that $100

&amp;#x200B;

Is the lesson worth $12? Absolutely. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Learn when to cut your losses, learn to admit your mistakes to yourself, don't beat yourself up and while doing that lose more money.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Mutual funds vs overpayments on mortgage (UK),"Like many, I spent part of the covid lockdown learning how to better take care of my money. I've built up some good habits, such as budgeting, separating my money for bills and spending money into different accounts, and, most importantly, putting away £300 each month into a couple of mutual funds in a stocks and shares ISA.   


Recently bought our first house, so am now 4 months into a 35 year, £94,000 mortgage. We've been doing the place up, but have ended up with a little more left over cash than expected. My question now is, with the spare cash I have just devaluing in my current account do I put it into overpayments on my mortgage, or do I put it into something like the S&amp;P 500, or one of the other funds I'm invested in.   


Here's why I'm stuck. I made 25% return on my investment in mutual funds since this time last year. I appreciate this is very lucky. Some years it could go down, but it should average around 7-8% a year over many years. My mortgage interest rate is 3.24%. It's slightly less than half of what I could make from funds, but it's guaranteed that I will save that 3.24% on anything I put in in overpayments. The guaranteed outcome and bringing down the LtV ratio of my mortgage seems to just about outweigh the potential profit that I could make from relatively risky mutual funds, but one thing that adds to the argument is being able to sell the funds acts as a cash buffer in case I lost my job or needed a large sum of cash for any emergency or house repair reason.   


So option 1:  
Put my spare cash into funds. Have it in case of emergency or job loss, but take accept that my real term rewards are going to be less whatever I would have saved by putting it into mortgage overpayments, but with the same level of risk...  


or, option 2:   
Put my spare cash into mortgage overpayments. Lose access to it (I would still keep a couple months bills in the bank of course, I wouldn't leave myself living hand to mouth), but save a guaranteed 3.24% on anything I put in there and work towards bringing my mortgage to value ratio down and hopefully getting a better deal when the minimum term ends in a couple of years.   


Any guidance, or other aspects to this conundrum which I haven't considered I would love to hear them! I'm sure I'm not the first or last to ask this kind of question. Peace x",finance

The first line says to withhold a total of $798 per paycheck. The Step 2 line says to send a updated W-4 that has $63 on line 4c, basically adding an additional $63 per paycheck to be withheld. I am not comprehending this, because obviously $798 does not equal $204 ($141 + $63).",finance

Fyi I estimate that I can get a loan for about 26k at 6 apr at 72 months. More than likely monthly payment will be around $400 and I will have about $700 I would pay monthly.

I got a call from government officials (it was a spoofed number) and resulted in making transaction worth of $9450 total.  
I know I'm stupid that I fell for such scam now that I think of it, but it happened so I've gone ahead and filed a fraud claim with my bank on the day this happened, as well as filed police reports with local police department, CFPB, FTC, and all the other ""government"" places that I could find to file a claim.

I've sent them everything that I had which could possibly work as an evidence to support my claim.  


it happened on the 30th, and I've been contacting my bank every day to check the status and all the information that I'm getting is that they are ""investigating"",  
and no I have not gotten any credit for lost funds in the meantime  


How likely do you think is it that the bank will compensate for the loss due to fraud if it's proven to be true, and that they could find out that this was due to a legitimate fraud?",finance

personalfinance,Universal Life insurance policy with 4.5% interest rate,"My grandfather purchased a universal life insurance policy for me back in 1987 when I was 5 years old. My parents generally paid the premiums until I was an adult, and now it is mine to deal with. I have read that universal life isn't a great product, but I'm not sure about my particular case.

Any amount I pay per month in excess of the cost of insurance seems to contribute to the ""cash value"" of the policy and earn 4.5% interest. This interest rate has been the same for the 15 or so years I've been paying attention to this policy and appears to be a ""guaranteed"" rate that can never change. If I put about $6k into this thing, it seems the policy would essentially become self-sustaining (e.g., the interest would be enough to cover the cost of insurance. Then any excess contribution would appear to also earn the 4.5% interest, and it seems I can withdraw this at any time (though maybe I'd have to call them and have them issue me a check or something). My parents withdrew money occasionally when I was a child.

Currently, they ask me to pay something like $330 a quarter, which I currently do not do. So the cost of insurance is instead paid from the existing cash value of the policy, which is slowly diminishing each month and expected to run out in 2023.

This sorta seems like it could be a savings account with a 4.5% interest rate (after I cross that $6k hurdle), which certainly beats most banks these days. Am I missing something?",finance

personalfinance,Roughly how much money should I allocate to furnishing a two bedroom apt?,"So I'm planning on moving out soon and if my room mate and I's application gets approved I'm going to start buying some furniture and stuff. We have some stuff, mostly kitchen things and I bought some things for my bathroom. And for my bedroom I'll be taking what is in my current room, and I honestly don't care what he does with his room...because its his lol. However, there's a nice big living room and a space we are going to turn into an office and I know I have to fill it with something. 

Right now I'm focusing on the living room because it's the first thing you see when you walk in, and there are also some things for my room that aren't necessities but that I'd like to have included in this (I will obviously nix these if I can't afford it, though), and the total cost is going to be around 886.10 dollars. And I really don't think that's bad for furnishing an entire living room plus some random things we need. 

I do have a nice amount of money in my savings account (5,400 right now, but I'm also about to get paid) so I'm not really worried about if I can technically afford this, but I don't want to needlessly spend too much.

I really want the apartment to look nice, though. I know my room mate couldn't care less and would just buy a bunch of random shit from craigslist but I'm not about having shitty furniture, especially because if I'm gonna spend the money I'd like it to last. 

So does this sound like a good deal or should I look for things cheaper? This price includes a couch, two chairs, a book case, coffee table, side table for a lamp because otherwise there will be no light :D, this cool rug, a mat for your shoes which I'm gonna buy either way because the place is mainly carpet and otherwise we'd be tracking mud in, a storage ottoman for blankies and stuffed animals cause I have a lot, and also some things for my room like a tapestry to act as a black out curtain for the window since I work overnights and sleep during the day.

personalfinance,Got myself into a broke-cycle. Struggling to figure out the escape,"Well I did it again. I have a bad habit of going into a depressive slump and spending all my money. Two years ago, I found myself in a cycle where I’d end up completely broke half way through the month. I ended up barely squeezing out of this by taking a new job the doubles my salary, coming up with a plan to get myself out of the small amounts of debt I had and get straight.

But here I again. Last month I ran out of money about half way through, really squeezed to try and get out of it. And not 5 days into this month I’m out again. Right now the problem is several accounts with reoccurring payments. Rent is the obvious heavy hitter. Reducing that is unlikely as my credit score wouldn’t allow and cash reserve wouldn’t allow for a move and I need to move somewhat close to work because I can’t drive. I have around 4 credit card/loans open at the moment. One personal loan with around $6k left that I was paying down from $8k, but I’ve been missing payments the past months. Two smaller loans with high interest rates. One almost gone, and the other probably at a couple hundred left that if I had the ability to pay off immediately wouldn’t be an issue, but the monthly interests make the payments about a few hundred themselves. These I’m pretty much stuck without something drastic like bankruptcy I assume. I expected to be clean of all debt this year, but obviously that didn’t work out. Hopefully though, I can still eliminate the credit card.

Outside those there are some other hard hitters: Power. My power bill was significantly higher this month, probably because of summer. Obviously I can only do so much to reduce this. Mobile. Unfortunately I put myself in a bad situation not expecting to fall this low and have a relatively high mobile bill including plans and device payments. This is about $250/m right now and I don’t see a way out of this. Then there’s also a lease I have that comes out to around $350/m. This I believe can be dropped. Also thanks to last month, a huge chunk of my pay check got eaten by NSF fees and repayments to short “loan” apps I used to make it through.

I’m paid monthly. The aforementioned stuff has left me broke already with just a few bucks left  big problem this month. Outside of being broke is I haven’t paid power or mobile. Thankfully I got rent taken care of in time. I’m looking at selling some things to maybe get $600 more this month, but it’s no guarantee  as to the timeline and I don’t have a lot of things with a high resale value. I have a lot of expensive shit, but most of it likely can’t be resold do to their niche uses.

Here’s what I do no can be done. There are some smaller items, mostly regular (nearly daily) $20-30 purchases I could eliminate if I muster up the willpower. That might give me a few hundred more per month, but other than that, I have so many monthly debts, most which seem they can’t be eliminated which eat me fast. It’s going to be difficult to avoid the same NSF stuff this months. I don’t want to lose $1000 due a crazy negative balance come August. 

I could also look into what I did last time, basically finding a job to double my salary again, but while possible it would take months of prep that I don’t have. I also need to start saving and do some things to help get my life in order, that seem to be out of reach at the moment because of the financial situation. It’s embarrassing, because I make ok money, but. I suppose I could do this no matter how much I’m making.",finance

investing,Are leveraged funds worth it? Probably.,"Leveraged Funds - An Extensive Review

`warning. long post.`

&amp;#x200B;

**What is a Leveraged Fund?**

Leveraged  funds track a multiplication of the daily movement of its underlying  asset. First becoming popular in the mid-2000’s, many leveraged funds  exist tracking a wide variety of different underlying assets. Most  importantly, it is crucial to know that leveraged funds track the daily  movement of its underlying, not weekly, monthly, annually, or  perpetually, but daily. This dramatically affects the outcomes of  leveraged funds compared to their underlying over time.

**Popular Leveraged Index(ish) Funds**

|Ticker|Description|Add. Details|
|:-|:-|:-|
| TQQQ | 3x leveraged QQQ | (Nasdaq-100) |
| SPXL | 3x leveraged S&amp;P 500 | (higher fee, higher dividend) |
| UPRO | 3x leveraged S&amp;P 500 | (lower fee, lower dividend) |
| UDOW | 3x 30 largest Dow Jones companies ||
|TNA| 3x small cap companies ||
|SQQQ| negative 3x QQQ ||
|VXX| 3x short term futures | (often inverses the market as a whole) |
|TMF| 3x 20 Year US Treasury Bond Fund ||

&amp;#x200B;

**Popular Leveraged Sector Funds**

|Ticker|Leverage| Industry |
|:-|:-|:-|
| SOXL | 3x | semiconductors |
| FAS | 3x | financial sector |
| FNGU | 3x | FANG stocks |
| NUGT | 2x | gold miners |
| LABU | 3x | biotech companies |
| DFEN | 3x | aerospace and defense |
| GUSH | 2x | oil and gas |

&amp;#x200B;

**How does a Leveraged Fund Maintain Asset Value?**

It’s  complicated. The ETFs don’t have their full holdings invested in the  underlying. They use a complex system of credit equity swaps and futures  trading to maintain adequate daily leverage. Basically, these ETFs use  different versions of similarly correlated futures trading backed by  investment banks instead of asset holdings backed by the markets.

Another way that these ETFs make money (although not hugely substantial) is that they require higher maintenance fees. While VOO has an  exceptionally low expense ratio of 0.03%, it’s 3x leveraged ETF, SPXL,  has an expense ratio of 1.01%. This cuts into the annual return of the  fund’s performance. While 1% is more than .03%, the former is still not  exceptionally substantial as far as ETF maintenance fees go.

# What are the Actual vs Theoretical Risks of Leveraged Funds?

*Post Standard - TQQQ*

*I  am using TQQQ for all of the examples throughout this article because  it is the most studied and most actively traded leveraged funds on the  market today. Plus, it is a leveraged INDEX fund. While SPXL, UPRO, UDOW  are also index-sourced, these are less studied and have less extensive backtesting data available.*

**Warning:** Leverage funds are dangerous tools even if the investor is 100%  intentional method, purpose, timeline, and risk managament.

The potential  risks of a triple leveraged fund are substantial when compared to the  general market. The biggest risk is that without consistent upwards  movement in the underlying, the leveraged fund will experience  volatility drag. Volatility drag over a stale market will eventually  deliver a 100% loss. The graph below offers the most simple explanation  of how volatility drag will pull down the return rate in the presence of  sideways trading.

**Theoretical Risk** \- sideways trading

||% return|QQQ|3x leverage|TQQQ|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
| Day 0 | 0% | $100 | 0% | $100 |
| Day 1 | \-10% | $90 |\-30%| $70 |
| Day 2 | 10% | $99 |30%| $91 |
| Day 3 | \-10% | $89.10 |\-30%| $63.70 |
| Day 4 | 10% | $98.01 |30%| $82.81 |
| Day 5 | \-10% | $88.21 |\-30%| $67.97 |

While  a continued series of -10% to +10% return (beta slippage) will  eventually lead both accounts closer and closer to $0, TQQQ drops at a  rate MUCH faster than QQQ. Nobody wants to watch their account lose 18%   in four days while the underlying only loses 2%. Following this  example, after 20 days, QQQ is valued at \~$90. TQQQ is valued at \~$39. A  highly volatile market is a leveraged fund’s worst enemy. This has  happened at different times throughout the history of the market, even  for up to a decade at time. It is a real risk and must be reckoned with.  While the Fed has taken measures to reduce the risk of market  volatility (discussed in shallow below), it is never eliminated.

&amp;#x200B;

**Actual Risk**

Graphed  below are different examples of how TQQQ would have performed against  general index funds. Note that these examples take place only in the  last 20 some odd years. TQQQ did not exist before the 2000’s, and  simulated backtesting is somewhat difficult to find and even more  difficult (for me) to create.

# Analyzing Two Different Methods

**Buy and Hold:** TQQQ vs QQQ

The graphs in [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/hcr47m/hypothetical_performance_of_tqqq_starting_at/) below show the possibilities of purchasing TQQQ in bulk at  separate points in time. The first at the height of the Dotcom bubble.  The second at it’s low in 2002. The results are vastly different. TQQQ  (in red) falls hard after the Dotcom Bust and never recovers its return  on initial investment. QQQ (in blue) recovers completely in a little  over a decade and climbs well past a full return on the initial  investment.

**Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA) $500/month:** TQQQ vs SPY 2000 - 2021

The graphs in this [google.sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RoyuOnxzl8ISPCPmZSB6xf5HgdtTFTN0AD40SZGGXzk/edit#gid=1168856709) represent investing in TQQQ  at the same time period, right before the Dotcom bubble burst. The first is 13 years worth of investing. The second is 21.  Both invest $500/month. This happens to be the maximum amount a Roth IRA allots for in a single year.

&amp;#x200B;

**Analyzing Strategies**

The two strategies begin investing at the same time, yet show significant differences in their return after 20 years. Dollar cost averaging into TQQQ has stupendous results  compared to SPY, beating overall performance ten times over.  Conversely, buying and holding TQQQ at or before the wrong moment in history results in a 70% negative return over twenty years. While the money invested in  2000 does poorly, the money invested in 2002, 2009, 2018, 2020, etc.  rockets upwards.

If $120,000 is invested using both methods ($500/month X 240 months), buying and holding returns approximately $36,000 while dollar cost averaging returns $6,000,000. Quite a difference. If you buy and hold, timing the marking is VERY important (also nearly impossible). 2002 or April 2020 would have been the best purchase time. DCA does not require timing as much as time-in the market and time left until retirement.

There may be many  different reasons why an investor buys and holds vs dollar cost  averages over a long period of time (available assets, unsure future income, etc.). If you do not have the ability to dollar cost  average into a triple leveraged fund, have a good risk mitigation strategy or don't purchase triple leveraged funds. Hedging may  be done by using different amounts of leverage, leveraged bonds instead  of stocks, portfolio rebalancing, etc. No matter what, investing in TQQQ  or other leveraged ETFs depends upon when the asset is purchased, how  much volatility drag the fund experiences, and how much each investor is  willing to hold through heavy losses.

**Personal Favorite Hedge Method**

(see literature review below, especially Hedgefundie, for other examples)

RE-BALANCE RE-BALANCE RE-BALANCE

First  lesson first, have a strategy on how best to protect your assets. No  matter what your personal risk tolerance is, have a number, or  percentage, or something at which you tell yourself, “Ok. It’s time to  keep this money safe and move it out of this leveraged fund.” The  warnings of the past are there. If you’ve invested everything into TQQQ,  then the market bursts, you’ve lost almost everything. Even if you have  a long timeline ahead of you, it’s better to have not been knocked with  a -90% return.

Ok ok, there are  critiques to this. The 20% circuit breaker didn’t exist in 2000, and  would have (maybe) prevented such a serious decline. Or hindsight has  allowed investors to know the symptoms of an overinflated market with a  too-high P/E ratio. No matter the case, I will personally always have a  re-balance rule or method that I will really try and follow (fingers  crossed).

If you want to read a  short synopsis of TQQQ, circuit breakers, and the fund potentially  dropping to $0, I would suggest the following thread: [https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/nm50u3/are\_leveraged\_inverse\_etfs\_truly\_as\_evil\_as\_web/](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/nm50u3/are_leveraged_inverse_etfs_truly_as_evil_as_web/).

Each  re-balancing method should be individually created based on your  investment timeline. If you have many years before your exit/drawdown, then greater exposure to TQQQ may be in your favor. If you are closer to  your exit strategy, then less exposure to these leveraged funds may be  more in your favor.

&amp;#x200B;

**A Frightening Consideration and How to Further Reduce Risk**

These  examples all track TQQQ leading up to 2021. What if the examples all led up to a major bubble burst?  Every dollar invested  before the bust would return a 99.9% drawdown.

The  only reasonable way to safeguard against this is to regularly rebalance  money out of TQQQ, or to invest on such a large time frame that a 99.9%  drawdown is not of concern due to the length of time yet to recover from  losses.

**Federal Actions To Prevent Major Market Corrections:** **Circuit Breakers, Trading Halts, Interest Rate Adjustments**

Circuit  breakers and trading halts were first introduced by the SEC after  market crashes in the 80’s. They didn’t really work and failed to  actually halt trading as expected during drawdowns. They were revised a  couple of times. The current iterations were finalized in early 2013  after the ‘12 crash. These operate under a series of different rules  depending on the performance of either the market or individual assets.  Read more in the links below. As for leveraged index ETFs, the most  important rules involve market-wide halts. The most important factor is  that if the S&amp;P drops 20% in a single day, all market trading is  halted for the remainder of that day (automatically, electronically, and  without failure). This resets the leverage for these funds or and thus  keeps losses at no more than -60% per day. There is no case in which a  leveraged index fund will lose 100% of its funds in a single day.

[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tradinghalt.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tradinghalt.asp)

[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/circuitbreaker.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/circuitbreaker.asp)

Lastly, and not super well researched but with general knowledge gained from MarketPlace and Planet Money, the Fed has taken a MUCH more active role over the last 10 years to manipulate federal interest rates for the stability of the (Wall Street) economy. While the US has not issued negative interest rates like the Germans have, it is not impossible to imagine that that might happen in  circumstances required.

It concludes that 2.4x leveraged would be the  best overall historical amount of leverage. 2x leveraged would always result in better than average returns over the long run. 3x leverage  would sometimes result in better than average returns. 4x leverage will  never result in better than average returns. **Read the website synopsis**.

Analyzing  the Moving Average price of an index in order to safeguard against  volatility. This uses the Moving Average Price of an index as a  correlation to volatility. If the index price is above the Moving  Average price, volatility trends downwards increasing the benefit of  leveraged funds. This method involves timing the market.

The  presence of a strong bull market that saves both accounts from deep  initial draw downs. Without a strong bull market, these leveraged funds  do not return a quality investment. While end results are high,  questioning the validity of the investment method will be tested when  you experience the psychological cost of investing into a seriously  negative portfolio.

&amp;#x200B;

**Personal Portfolio:** **Time to Put up or Shut up**

At the moment, I am personally (hopefully) 20-25 years away from retirement. My current portfolio looks as follows:

QQQ - 5%

QLD - 40%

TQQQ - 10%

VOO - 5%

SSO - 30%

SPXL - 10%

I  plan to increase my position in TQQQ and SPXL over time to 35% each.  With around 5 years left until retirement, I’ll want to move my risk to equal 10% 3x leveraged, 30% 2x leveraged, and 60% QQQ and VOO.  Maybe. It depends on how much total wealth I’ve accumulated. Blessed be the bull run.

&amp;#x200B;

**Reminder: Backtest your Thesis**

If you are not aware of [Portfolio Vizualizer’s backtesting website](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio),  I highly suggest you check it out. Test and try out some different  investment and rebalancing methods. It allows for many different  comparisons of portfolio make-ups, rebalancing methods, and benchmark  comparisons.

Using it, I can’t  help but ask myself, “Maybe I should put more into TQQQ and SPXL…” Just  remember this is not investment advice, just food for thought.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR**  Leveraged funds are the best things the stock market has ever produced.  The current system of market fail-safes makes 2x and 3x leveraged funds  too good not invest in. Maybe. Just read the damn article and study the  literature.

CryptoCurrency,Here’s what cryptocurrencies will look like in 50 years according to experts,"We may not know what stocks in the [S&amp;P 500](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.SPX) will do next month, or in two years, but over the decades, we have a pretty good hunch that they’ll go up. Most of us also know what a stock is, and that definition hasn’t changed [in centuries](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/07/stock-exchange-history.asp).

None of that is true, of course, with cryptocurrencies. Some predict the coins will [f](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/12/04/bitcoin-is-a-dangerous-speculative-bubble-yale-expert-says.html)[orever change how we understand and interact with money](https://www.gq.com/story/cryptocurrency-will-not-die) and others warn of[ a dangerous bubble](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/12/04/bitcoin-is-a-dangerous-speculative-bubble-yale-expert-says.html).

But whatever a person forecasts for cryptocurrencies, it’s getting harder to imagine a future without them.

CNBC asked experts from a variety of fields to describe their vision for the currencies 50 years from now. Their answers have been condensed and edited for clarity.

**• Ivory Johnson, certified financial planner and founder of Delancey Wealth Management**

“Cryptocurrencies will disrupt traditional finance because one of their most attractive utilities is the ability to efficiently transfer payment across borders with little to no cost, delay or foreign currency fluctuations. With respect to bitcoin, 50 years is a long time and bitcoin could either become the world reserve currency or the next AOL that made a lot of people wealthy until it was unseated by better technology.”

**• Frederick Kaufman, author of “The Money Plot: A History of Currency’s Power to Enchant, Control, and Manipulate”**

“Way before 2071, the dollar will have more in common with a crypto than with silver or gold, so there is no need to doubt the longevity of encrypted algorithms as stores of value and media of exchange. All money is a form of encryption. It’s been that way from the start, and as our lives converge ever more closely with the digital universe, the drive to invest in tokens will only accelerate. Ironically, that impulse will connect us to primitive instincts, and do its part to keep us human.”

**• Dan Egan, vice president of behavioral finance and investing at Betterment**

“Cryptocurrencies like bitcoin have proven themselves useful for money movement and speculation, and they’re unlikely to go away. But where and how we’ll generate the energy to meet the demand of a growing crypto market is worth considering, as well as whether state-actors who view it as a competitor to fiat power will make it even more of a black-market commodity.”

**• Dragan Boscovic, founder and director of the Blockchain Research Lab at Arizona State University**

“Central bank authorities are busy developing regulations on cryptocurrency. They recognize that digital currencies are native to the digital economy and, as such, are on their way to becoming mainstream in the next 10 years.”

**• Barbara Roper, director of investor protection for the Consumer Federation of America**

“Sorry. I decided a while back that I’m too old for this issue.”

TLDR: **It’s getting harder to imagine a future without cryptocurrencies. So we are still in it mighty early!**

personalfinance,Mother may be choosing to die; I will need to untangle the mess and need some advice.,"Hey everyone,

As the title mentions, my mother is currently in a life-threatening scenario where she needs a new liver to continue living.  It's a hard road ahead and tonight she called and expressed to myself, my sister, and my father-in-law that she wishes to die.  We're not sure if it's a ""bad day"" or if she just is fed up with being poked and prodded and whatnot - but she said it.  I'm a planner and feel the need to be ready in case this occurs.  I am 100% prepared to get a lawyer to do untangling, but I wanted to see if there is anything I'm missing.

First and foremost: She is married to my stepfather for 15 years now.  I'm aware that some of this turns up to be marital property, etc.  She does not have a will, so I'm sure probate gets involved in some of this.  We live in the state of Wisconsin.

**The Low-Down:**

She currently has the following:

* A Duplex that is *in her name only.*  She has about 14 years on the loan left and a balance of around $94,000.  She has two tenants; one is my sister, one is a renter.  Additionally, the *intention* is that she's wanted the duplex to go to my sister if she passed.
* She shares a house with my stepfather.  Both are on the loan.  There are 13 years left on this loan, I'm unsure of the balance.
* She's got multiple credit cards and about a total of $12,000 of credit card debt or personal loan debt.  *The debt is in her name only.*
* A car that is in both her and my stepfather's name.
* A life insurance policy.  I am the named beneficiary.  She did take out a loan against the total balance, there is still some left over.  I'm assuming I'll need to use some of this to pay debt she owes or some such.
* A pension and Social Security (I'm not sure if those just disappear when she dies or what happens.)
* Hospital bills.  Lots of hospital bills.

My questions:

* I believe the debts are ""the estate's"" debt after she dies.  My stepdad should not have to take on those debts if they are only in her name, correct?
* Does the life insurance get used as part of the estate to handle those debts?
* Can they take the house to pay the debts of the estate?  What about the duplex?  (Obviously I'd prefer neither happens.)
* Does the Duplex become my step-father's due to marital property or can we execute her wishes?
* Does this all go to probate since she never wrote a will?  Do I have time to get a will written if she decides this is truly it?  She's totally lucid right now.
* What am I missing?  I'm currently her financial PoA (she has signed all that prior to getting to this point).

I appreciate any and all help folks can give.  Thank you.",finance
personalfinance,Feedback appreciated,"I have been in the market for a minivan.  The market is so hot that most of the vans are sold between the time I see them online and inquire.  I saw a van Friday night that checks all of my boxes plus some.  Certified pre-owned with less than 40K miles.  It's a lease return.  

Here is my dilemma.   I have 6K in negative equity after my initial trade of a GMC Terrain.  The van is 35K.  The salesman informed me that because of the negative equity,  it will be a higher interest rate.  I have a 2010 Toyota Avalon that I can trade as well.  If they give me $6k for it, that will cover the negative equity.   No guarantee because I have to take it to them for appraisal.   The salesman did tell me that I can probably get more if I sell it privately (late hubby added an upgraded stereo system and remote starter).  Should I a)  See what they give me for the Avalon and if I break even, great, or b) Pay off the negative equity out of pocket, sell the Avalon privately and then pay down the loan.

Additionally,  with no money down, the payment would be between 7 and 8 hundred per month.  I don't want a car payment that high.  In that case, would I do better by asking what kind of down payment would get me to $450 per month?  If I pay it down, is gap insurance necessary?  It's a certified pre-owned so should I purchase an extended warranty.   I'm a recent widow and my husband took care of vehicle maintenance.   I would like to have the reassurance that a warranty brings.  Paying down the vehicle isn't an issue.  I have the funds, I'm just trying to put together the best deal.  They have not run my credit yet.  I applied through Honda financial and was denied.  I haven't been able to find out why.  My credit score is 753.  I make close to 100K.  It bummed me out to be denied.

Thank you in advance for your help.",finance
investing,how long does it take for the market to react to interest rate changes when they're expected well in advance as they are now?,"Its pretty clear from the recent moves that the market has moved back into risk on mode, which is interesting because its also pretty clear that the market absorbed the FOMC meeting last week w/ hardly much to the downside. That kinda signals to me that really the big investors arent too concerned with interest rates rising, because they have already priced it into their models, as opposed to inflation which was not priced in, hence the past two months correction to risky growth stocks.

With all that said, I still cant imagine that an FOMC meeting will occur where the FED announces interest rate increases and the market doesnt fall at all

For those who have been in the market longer than me, can you remember a time where we were at ATH's and an FOMC announcement of fed funds rate hikes did NOT cause a fall? Furthermore, if there always was a fall, is there usually a number of days prior to the FOMC meetings that the selloffs begin, or do people ride that risk right into the announcement itself?

Im not one to believe in timing the markets, but sometimes things are a bit too obvious about what will spur a downside catalyst. We've already expended the inflation fears, biden+congress most likely intend to announce even more spending right into elections, and covid fears are abating + recovery is decent with still lots of home purchases. There's not much else out there to act as a catalyst for a blown off top

it must be tapering or interest rates, and so that relies on the FOMC announcements and the fed president press releases",finance

cardano,"Cardano Rumor Rundown July 4, 2021","Hey Everyone!

Let's go...

Newly covered today: 

1. Lars has posted the first class for the second Plutus Pioneers cohort .  [https://twitter.com/LarsBrunjes/status/1410677447805308935](https://twitter.com/LarsBrunjes/status/1410677447805308935)
2. Robert Kornacki of dcSpark releases an article on why every Cardano dApp will use NFTs. The article contains some very interesting discussion on smart contracts in the EUTXO context including language instructing that “UTXOs have smart contracts attached to them and not the other way around” and “\[...\]the simplest way to think about it is that when a UTXO is created it has the option to have a smart contract attached to it.” [https://medium.com/dcspark/every-eutxo-dapp-will-use-nfts-and-heres-why-fd87e6a8c9a6](https://medium.com/dcspark/every-eutxo-dapp-will-use-nfts-and-heres-why-fd87e6a8c9a6)

Previously Covered but still interesting:

1. Manuel Chakravarty gave a big update on Hydra (layer 2 scaling). Hydra will not require that the base layer be modified since it will be implemented via Plutus smart contracts. Hydra is actually a collection of protocols including Hydra Head and Hydra Tail. Hydra Head is a symmetric protocol where multiple participants will be online simultaneously for the whole period of the head exchanging messages. Hydra Tail is an asymmetric protocol involving a high performance server and many clients that may be mobile and could be offline for large portions of the tail’s existence. There will also be “inter head &amp; tail networking” which will allow for a network of heads and tails. They have a published research paper on Hydra Head. They are currently writing the Hydra Tail paper.
2. Hydra is distinguished from other layer 2 protocols by its isomorphic properties. This means you will be able to run any smart contract that works on the base layer in a Hydra Head! This is very special. We won’t need special purpose contracts built out just for layer 2. There are some big implications to this. Since a Hydra Head is essentially just a Plutus smart contract, this means you can run a Hydra Head inside another Hydra Head. It’s turtles all the way down, guys. It sounds like they can do this iteratively as much as they want.
3. Aggelos also gave a good presentation on the importance of “skin in the game” in resource based consensus protocols (both proof-of-work and proof-of-stake) and its effect on promotion or discouragement of centralization. He explained how Ouroboros has built-in safeguards to prevent centralization including the K parameter (currently at 500) which caps total rewards per pool and the alpha parameter (currently at 0.3) which splits rewards into a 77% piece and a 23% piece. A pool can take its share of the 77% piece based on the pool’s total stake and its share of the 23% piece based on the pledge of the SPO. A higher alpha parameter makes it less attractive for individual SPOs to proliferate multiple pools since they can’t be as leveraged on their available pledge and still get as big a share of the 23% piece. This also discourages Sybil Attacks. As Cardano on-chain governance progresses, these parameters will be controlled by the community.
4. There will be a Cardano Goguen Summit in September. It will be hybrid digital/in-person.
5. Charles is helping to bring the cryptographer who broke SHA-1 to the University of Wyoming. The Cardano funded blockchain lab there could be on the road to be a powerhouse.

8. Professor Aggelos Kiayias recently dropped a video explaining exactly how Mithril (apparently neckbeard dungeon master talk for elf armor) is going to allow for Perfect Cardano (ADA) wallets that combine the ease of use and convenience of light wallets with the trustlessness of full node wallets. We also learned exactly how Mithril is going to work. [https://youtu.be/LhepJFCyWRk](https://youtu.be/LhepJFCyWRk)
9. In proof-of-work, bootstrapping can be done with blockheaders. This won’t do in proof-of-stake since we need information about stakeholder distribution to confirm block validity.
10. Mithril fixes this by being a cryptographic construction that enables a population of stakeholders to issue a signature consistent with certain constraints.
11. For Mithril to work in proof-of-stake, it needs three crucial properties: 1) it needs to enforce a threshold ratio of stakeholders before the signature is issued; 2) the pre-signature fragments must be independently verified and subject to public aggregation; and 3) it must be efficient in the sense that the final signature is of constant size and is logarithmically dependent on the # of stakeholders.
12. Stakeholders will issue special Mithril keys along with the normal cryptographic key material. Then at regular intervals, full nodes will test whether they can produce a pre-signature fragment. Only a random subset of stakeholders will be eligible to produce a pre-signature fragment. When a sufficient # of pre-signature fragments have been issued by eligible stakeholders then it will be possible to aggregate the fragments into a final signature.
13. This will be a checkpoint that will be verifiable with respect to previous check points all the way back to the genesis block. Such checkpoints will be cryptographic commitments of the relevant UTXOs.
14. Since the checkpoints will be trustless, a light client (i.e. wallet) will only need to verify the sequence of checkpoints up to the current time to trustlessly bootstrap.
15. The ecosystem is growing so fast, it’s hard to keep up with all the projects without these infographics at this point. [https://twitter.com/Dr\_shwetaPHD/status/1398783893638103040](https://twitter.com/Dr_shwetaPHD/status/1398783893638103040)

48. The mid-month Alonzo development update from IOHK is out. Alonzo blue is in full swing and they are working on “hello world round trips” going from the node to the ledger and back. Plutus Partners (third party functional dev firms) are working on different use cases ahead of the Alonzo launch.

51. Charles recorded for the Lex Fridman Podcast. It went over five hours. This is a big deal given that Lex has 1.12 million subscribers and it’s closer to mainstream than a crypto audience. [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1403498549300584448](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1403498549300584448) [https://www.youtube.com/user/lexfridman](https://www.youtube.com/user/lexfridman)
52. The Marlowe Webinar with Shruti is now available on youtube. Very interesting discussion of DeFi in general and also specific topics like “deep interoperability” in DeFi. Cardano is obviously already doing the very involved thinking about the future of DeFi. [https://youtu.be/vzsUSG5CSj0](https://youtu.be/vzsUSG5CSj0)
53. John O’Connor recently tweeted about a day where he “wrote a letter to a president” and “found a million users to bring into Cardano”. Sounds like the Cardano train is rolling along as smoothly as ever in Africa. [https://twitter.com/jjtoconnor/status/1402565547716399104](https://twitter.com/jjtoconnor/status/1402565547716399104)
54. Zach Guzman and Mike Novogratz get an opportunity to prove once again how extremely threatened they are by the fact that they can’t frontrun Cardano at this point. [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1404100510525841408](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1404100510525841408)

56. President of Tanzania calls on the central bank to prepare for the adoption of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. I wonder what crypto ecosystem already has experience working with an African government on a big crypto project and has partnered with a mobile company that is already bringing connectivity to rural Tanzania?

57. Hedgefund Billionaire Paul Tudor Jones tells the world to buy crypto and certain other assets if the Fed doesn’t address inflation in their policy meeting that concludes on Wednesday. JP Morgan’s Jamie Dimon concurs that the current inflation is very likely not transitory. This could be tremendously good timing for Cardano given our top five status and the impending mainnet launch of smart contracts.

58. With exploits like this one being all too common in the legacy smart contract networks, we’re not even going to have sell the Cardano use case for DeFi. The competitor networks have already made the case that something better must be on the way.

61. While renewable energy is certainly a wonderful thing, there may be a problem with your technology when your path to compete on clean energy consumption involves you talking about harnessing the power of a whole series of volcanoes. Maybe just use fewer volcano’s and more proof-of-stake? [https://twitter.com/\_eLaPs\_/status/1404125569093029889](https://twitter.com/_eLaPs_/status/1404125569093029889) [https://twitter.com/gladstein/status/1402718041557725184](https://twitter.com/gladstein/status/1402718041557725184)

65. The bank of England is getting very serious about how it “may wish to limit migration” of money from the legacy system to stablecoins. Wow. Just another example of why it’s such an asset (no pun intended) that Cardano is prepared for regulation.

69. It’s a good sign that the top two crypto communities are spending so much time talking negatively about Cardano. You only focus your hatred on that which is most threatening. I’m glad to see we’re the biggest threat on their radar. [https://twitter.com/nic\_\_carter/status/1405194146063736840](https://twitter.com/nic__carter/status/1405194146063736840)
70. Bloomberg just published a piece called “America Should Become a Nation of Renters”. While this statement is probably extremely polarizing for Americans, it can also be argued that the death of homes as the primary investment vehicle of Americans may open up a new wave of adoption in crypto as an alternative. [https://twitter.com/bopinion/status/1405609396302979074](https://twitter.com/bopinion/status/1405609396302979074)

72. All 345,501 of the people who have watched the Lex Fridman/Charles episode as of writing are realizing that Cardano could be the first project to put voting on the blockchain in a U.S. state. [https://www.atalaprism.io/app](https://www.atalaprism.io/app)
73. Days like today in Cardano and the greater crypto space always reminds me that there have been other great adoption stories that went through periods like this.[https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1407077949774442499](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1407077949774442499)
74. It looks like the second biggest ETH stakepool or it's custody provider has lost it’s users private keys to $75MM in ETH. Cardano doesn’t have this problem. We get to keep custody of our crypto because we found a better way than slashing. [https://stakehound.com/blog-post/fireblocks-eth-2-key-management-incident/](https://stakehound.com/blog-post/fireblocks-eth-2-key-management-incident/) [https://twitter.com/JamesSpediacci/status/1407465311180255236](https://twitter.com/JamesSpediacci/status/1407465311180255236)

76. COTI (a project with very close ties to Cardano) is coming to Ledger. [https://medium.com/cotinetwork/coti-native-is-coming-to-ledger-c56b04df1253](https://medium.com/cotinetwork/coti-native-is-coming-to-ledger-c56b04df1253)
77. The June Cardano 360 is currently available on Youtube. [https://youtu.be/al5m14299ww](https://youtu.be/al5m14299ww)
78. We saw segments on various newer partner entities like Nervos, Orion Protocol, and Revuto. Nervos is a UTXO proof-of-work blockchain which is building a cross-chain bridge with Cardano so that you can use your ADA on Nervos dApps and vice versa. Interoperability is a big theme for Nervos and they plan to have a working testnet within a month. Orion Protocol is building a terminal that will allow for decentralized non-custodial trading across centralized and decentralized exchanges. They say this would not require you to KYC or even have an account with any of these exchanges. Revuto is an online subscription management service that recently completed a $10MM token sale on Cardano.
79. It was also revealed that Wolfram Labs, COTI, and IOHK have a three-way partnership (a ménage à tech) to build an NFT auction site. The people from Wolfram were talking about very interesting things including live minting during streaming events and automated upload to IPFS. COTI will be building out auction and bidding mechanisms in ADAPay.
80. Professor Aggelos Kiayias gave us an update on research including that Ouroboros Chronos and Hydra papers have both been accepted into conferences/journals. Chronos will provide Cardano with a global concept of time that doesn’t rely on any outside timekeeper. Prof. Kiayias also pointed out that Hydra is distinguishable from other layer two protocols in that the scripting language is identical to that of the base layer in Cardano such that any dApp that can run on Cardano will run on the Hydra L2. This is a huge plus and superior to many other layer two solutions in other ecosystems where the base layer dApps will not run on layer two. Finally, the Mithril paper has been submitted for peer review. It will provide Cardano light wallets with Succinct Non-interactive Arguments of Knowledge that will give us the best of both worlds: no delays for syncing as in full node wallets while still preserving trustlessness.
81. Finally, the Goguen Summit will be in late September. Sign up now at [summit.cardano.org](http://summit.cardano.org/).
82. The Fed is once again STRONGLY signalling to us that they are going to regulate stablecoins. The Fed is also specifically calling out Tether for the first time. You need to be thinking about how stablecoin regulation might affect your favorite Cardano DeFi or other project. [https://twitter.com/CaitlinLong\_/status/1408500265397985282](https://twitter.com/CaitlinLong_/status/1408500265397985282) [https://twitter.com/CaitlinLong\_/status/1408572624125534212](https://twitter.com/CaitlinLong_/status/1408572624125534212)
83. People are starting to realize that the Stakehound private key loss in ETH may attract unwanted regulatory attention to Ethereum 2.0 while this problem could never have occurred in Cardano. Also, only a few days later another ETH stakepool (this time SharedStake...the sixth biggest ETH Stakepool) allegedly experiences a rugpull that some are valuing at over $30MM. This is another problem that could not happen in Cardano staking. It feels like we stepped into the ring, they rang the bell, and ETH just started punching itself in the head. Eventually it’s going to KO itself.

CryptoCurrency,The crypto Dead Man's Switch - utilising smart contracts to transfer wealth automatically at death,"It's a movie trope you've probably seen many times before: ""If I die, all that incriminating evidence is sent straight to the Feds!""  Could the blockchain do this one day? The Apple Watch already has an automatic SOS feature where it will call emergency services with a latitude and longitude if the accelerometer registers a hard fall. Take this just a little bit further: the heartrate monitor detects asystolic cardiac arrest for 30 minutes. This triggers an oracle that tells a smart contract within your crypto on the blockchain to move it to a pre-determined wallet automatically. 

Seeing some posts here about making provisions for your loved ones after death got me thinking about the volume of crypto that must be lost forever on the blockchain. Maybe a Dead Man's Switch could help ensure this occurs just a little less. 

Last thought: Could smart contracts also fulfil the movie trope scenario? If you didn't interact with a blockchain asset within certain time parameters could it ""move itself"" to another wallet? Thanks for indulging my curiosity guys.",cryptocurrency

CryptoCurrency,Daddy Elon &amp; His Doge Tumbles!!!,"I firmly believe that Mr. Daddy Elon Musk is actually part of the PES status aboard Space X shuttles so it's been determined his newly Persian diet he's part of the irignuo colony and has some genes relating to the heritage of King Horishander from ancient Rome. If anyone has any questions, feel free to comment and I will thouroughly explain my thoughts in detail

Musk has been known to pivot in reality all around the world at all times, whether that's on Twitter or in person to his people, it's one big illusion that creates the likelihood of owning crypto currency a dream worth having. Daddy Elon is smart, daddy musk musk is adopting new diets and saving the birds and frogs from the massive Bitcoin mines in Australian forests. 

I've been here in crypto since daddy musky helped me use the urinal in Texas, we met at an establishment and my hand is missing so I can't hold peepee but daddy saw and offered his hand on my peepee and it was rock solid daddy Elon wasn't scared he kept on holding then I think he stroked once and I shoot special cream sauce on his hand, daddy Elon laughed but I never forget that moment! I am not crazy I am Human! Part Musk! Read into me you'll see!

He has a couple more chances before the feds contact him about his complications with China and with daddays family. They are non existent and an illusion of his own mind which he procreates and influences upon this new generation of weasels and low life dull talon to become like him and become robot mind robot brain.

CryptoCurrency,Interest Rates July 2021,"First post was deleted because I was on the wrong account. Let's try again. When looking for a place to compare crypto interest rates I found most sites were either out of date, inaccurate, or didn't compare sites I was interested in. I got tired of looking so I ended up just scraping the data myself. Here are the current interest rates as of the beginning of July 2021.

The values here are all for the lowest level, tier 1, etc. rates. These are all non-staking rates. Hope some find this data helpful. These seem like some of the more popular platforms. If I missed one, let me know.

Edit: Coinbase ALGO rate 6% --&gt; 4%

Edit2: Coinbase ATOM == 5%

Edit3: All rates are pulled directly from the sites listed. As I said in my original post, 3rd party sites seem to be consistently inaccurate.

Edit4: Slow day at work, so per the comments I've added Binance.US and Crypto.com. Seems like Binance rates float around, so the APY posted is for most recent payout. Crypto.com has multiple tiers, to keep things as apples-to-apples, these are for lowest tier and flexible terms. All rates listed are for US.",cryptocurrency

investing,I read a macro paper about a 50-year market-beating strategy. Here’s my layman’s summary and analysis.,"Hey guys - been doing a lot of reading recently and figured I should share some of the cooler stuff with the community. I whipped this up quickly but can do a more in-depth dive for this and other papers if there turns out to be interest. The paper is called [A Half Century of Macro Momentum](https://www.aqr.com/-/media/AQR/Documents/Insights/White-Papers/A-Half-Century-of-Macro-Momentum.pdf) by Jordan Brooks of AQR Capital. They’re a quant fund that runs a number of successful strategies. Nothing I say here is investment advice by the way, and I do recommend checking out the paper if interested.

**- - - Executive Summary (given in paper)**

*I outline a systematic and diversified approach to global macro investing grounded in economic theory, and detail its performance over the last half century. The analysis shows that the strategy has the potential to deliver strong positive returns, low correlation to traditional asset classes across various macroeconomic environments, and to provide diversification in bear equity markets and rising real yield environments. This systematic global macro strategy appears to be a complement to other alternative risk premia — such as trend-following and long-short value, momentum, and carry strategies — and does not appear to be fully exploited by existing global macro managers.*

**- - - My Summary (in layman’s terms)**

Global macro is a type of investing that involves looking at macroeconomic factors, well, globally. These factors include stuff like unemployment, business cycles, interest rates, international trade, and monetary policy (actions of the Fed and central banks around the world). Global macro investors make predictions based on studying these factors to figure out their outlook for the economy, and invest accordingly. This means their investment universe is much larger than just stocks. They look at long-term government bonds, currencies, and interest rate-affected assets (like short term bonds).

Momentum trading is a strategy that typically involves looking at trends in stock prices and assuming that those trends will keep on going for a short period. For example, if there is upward momentum on a stock, momentum traders want to get in now while it’s still going up. Clearly, this is usually a short-term trading strategy.

In a nutshell, macro momentum is a macro investing strategy that pulls from momentum strategies. Instead of looking at price trends, it looks at macroeconomic trends. It goes long (buys) assets that have positive macroeconomic indicators (explained below) and short (sells) if vice versa. The four asset types this strategy looks at are stocks, currencies, long-term government bonds, and short-term bonds (the paper calls this “global interest rates”). The four macroeconomic indicators this strategy looks at are business cycles (generally, how is the economy doing), monetary policy (what is the Fed doing, is it conservative or aggressive), international trade, and risk sentiment (are stocks going up or down). 

[Exhibit 1: Summary of Macro Momentum Indicators](https://i.imgur.com/x1nJJcF.png)

Let’s talk through how I think about this, starting with the column “Increasing Growth.” If the economy is doing well, people have money, so they invest their money into stocks, making the outlook good for stocks. Stocks usually give more of a return than bonds, so their demand goes down, as does their price, making the outlook worse for longer term and shorter term bonds — I’m aware this isn’t the full picture but it’s how I think about it, bond folks please chip in if you’d like to add anything here. Growth is good for currencies as it is accompanied by more business and foreign investment, meaning more demand for the currency - the paper talks about the Balassa-Samuelson hypothesis here, which pretty much says countries with high productivity and therefore prices for tradable goods have higher prices for services too (developed countries vs. developing countries).

Moving to int’l trade, this is captured by looking at whether the currency is depreciating (getting weaker, purchasing power decreasing) on a 1-year basis. Depreciating currency is good for stocks (because our currency is weaker compared to int’l currencies, our goods are relatively cheaper and there’s more demand for them and the companies that sell them), bad for currencies (similar idea to momentum, if currencies have been depreciating, we expect them to continue), and bad for bonds and interest rates. For this last bit, here’s how I think about it — if my currency is depreciating and getting weaker than other currencies, global investors don’t want to be holding it (effectively, its “price” is decreasing). Something that makes a currency attractive is a high interest rate, so parking your money in that currency earns you interest, so a weakening currency’s central bank has less incentive to decrease rates. The price of bonds and other interest rate products increases as rates decrease, meaning this environment/scenario is overall negative for bonds.

Monetary policy, captured by looking at 1-year changes in the yield curve - this is where the x axis is the term of the bond and the y axis is the interest rate paid, it’s usually upward sloping in a good economy and downward in a bad one. If the Fed gets tighter (money printer out of ink), this is bad for stocks and bonds because there’s not as much money to go into these; and it’s good for currencies because it decreases the money supply and increases interest rates (more int’l investment into our currency).

Finally, the risk sentiment is captured by looking at 1-year stock market returns. Increasing risk sentiment is when the stock market has strong returns. This is good for stocks (momentum) and currencies (int’l investment into our stocks), and bad for bonds (who wants to invest in bonds when stocks are doing so well).

**- - - Creating a Macro Momentum Portfolio**

With this in mind, we now want to create our macro momentum portfolio. This will consist of a long-short portfolio (LS) and a directional portfolio (D) for each combo of indicators and assets. So there’s four indicators times four asset types times two types of portfolios meaning we’ll have 32 “sub” portfolios total that we’ll then combine into the final macro momentum portfolio. 

LS — these are market neutral. This portfolio takes a long position in assets with favorable trends (above the average) and short for the assets with unfavorable trends (below the average). Because we’re doing all this with the average in mind, there’s a theoretical neutral exposure to the market, meaning this should perform despite market movements.

D — these take long positions in assets with favorable trends and shorts in assets with unfavorable trends, meaning there’s no computation of an average, and the portfolio can be long or short-exposed.

So we have a LS portfolio for stocks using the economic growth (business cycle) indicator, a D portfolio for the same, an LS for stocks using int’l trade as an indicator, a D portfolio for the same, etc. Once we have the 32 total, he aggregate macro momentum portfolio is created by taking an equal weight across all 32 asset-indicator portfolios.

It’s easy to get lost in the specifics here, so I’ll repeat what we’re doing from a bird’s eye view again. We’re looking at 4 macroeconomic indicators from generally the past year, applying those indicators to 4 asset classes to make a table like the above, and then pretty much using those indicators to predict how the asset classes will perform over the next year. Rebalanced annually.

**- - - Performance**

This portfolio was tested from Jan 1970 to Dec 2016. That means it’s seen the bear markets of 1987, 2000, and 2008, but not 2020. It’s also seen recessions, wars, stagflation, and disinflation. Here are the results in a table:

[Exhibit 3: Macro Momentum Strategy Performance since 1970](https://i.imgur.com/bbeBBzU.png)

Let’s unpack this. Looks like a consistently market-beating strategy that is un-correlated with the stock and bond markets. One question you might have is, “if this is so good, why doesn’t AQR just invest fully in it?“ The best answer here is probably liquidity — as a fund with \~$150B in assets, it’s impossible to employ your capital all in one strategy without affecting prices enough that you’d no longer be beating markets. Also, AQR’s only been around since 1998, and although I’m sure they had this research in some way or another before the paper was published, it did just come out in 2017.

The table shows a CAGR for the strat (without accounting for inflation) of 13%, compared to [8.41% for the S&amp;P](http://www.moneychimp.com/features/market_cagr.htm). It beats its composite assets' returns in rising yield and falling yield markets, in bull runs and bear markets (on average), and has a higher Sharpe Ratio than the S&amp;P for the period (1.2 vs. around 1.0). It’s non-correlated with bonds and has something of a negative correlation with stocks. Does the latter number mean it goes down when stocks go up, meaning it’s gone down for the majority of the period. No. The paper calls the returns of the strategy a “smile” compared to stock returns. Here’s a graph.

[Exhibit 2: Quarterly Returns, 1970-2016](https://i.imgur.com/ZQO1o8p.png)

When stocks are up, this portfolio is up a bit too (that's called a slightly positive beta). When stocks are down, this portfolio is up a whole lot (a very negative beta). On average, the portfolio has a slightly negative beta compared to stocks, as mentioned earlier.

stocks,I read a macro paper about a 50-year market-beating strategy. Here’s my layman’s summary and analysis.,"Hey guys - been doing a lot of reading recently and figured I should share some of the cooler stuff with the community. I whipped this up quickly but can do a more in-depth dive for this and other papers if there turns out to be interest. The paper is called [A Half Century of Macro Momentum](https://www.aqr.com/-/media/AQR/Documents/Insights/White-Papers/A-Half-Century-of-Macro-Momentum.pdf) by Jordan Brooks of AQR Capital. They’re a quant fund that runs a number of successful strategies. Nothing I say here is investment advice by the way, and I do recommend checking out the paper if interested.

**- - - Executive Summary (given in paper)**

*I outline a systematic and diversified approach to global macro investing grounded in economic theory, and detail its performance over the last half century. The analysis shows that the strategy has the potential to deliver strong positive returns, low correlation to traditional asset classes across various macroeconomic environments, and to provide diversification in bear equity markets and rising real yield environments. This systematic global macro strategy appears to be a complement to other alternative risk premia — such as trend-following and long-short value, momentum, and carry strategies — and does not appear to be fully exploited by existing global macro managers.*

**- - - My Summary (in layman’s terms)**

Global macro is a type of investing that involves looking at macroeconomic factors, well, globally. These factors include stuff like unemployment, business cycles, interest rates, international trade, and monetary policy (actions of the Fed and central banks around the world). Global macro investors make predictions based on studying these factors to figure out their outlook for the economy, and invest accordingly. This means their investment universe is much larger than just stocks. They look at long-term government bonds, currencies, and interest rate-affected assets (like short term bonds).

Momentum trading is a strategy that typically involves looking at trends in stock prices and assuming that those trends will keep on going for a short period. For example, if there is upward momentum on a stock, momentum traders want to get in now while it’s still going up. Clearly, this is usually a short-term trading strategy.

In a nutshell, macro momentum is a macro investing strategy that pulls from momentum strategies. Instead of looking at price trends, it looks at macroeconomic trends. It goes long (buys) assets that have positive macroeconomic indicators (explained below) and short (sells) if vice versa.

From the article, the chart was overlaid with annual S&amp;amp;P charts in periods of 15 years and 30 years. Does this form an actual pattern? I suppose some events are predictable in that it happen at the same time each year, e.g earnings, Fed notes, unemployment #, etc.  

https://vantagepointtrading.com/stock-market-seasonal-trends-sp-500-seasonal-trends/

The chart shows how the price tends to move at different times of the year.

Since the stock has a long-term upward bias, the seasonal charts reflect this. The S&amp;amp;P 500 rises, on average, year-over-year which is reflected in the chart moving from the lower left to the upper right of the chart.

The S&amp;amp;P 500 usually moves lower in January, putting in lows near the start of February. The price then starts to rise, although February also isn’t usually a great month, as shown in the chart below.

By mid-March prices are often rising and often peak in early May.

The start of May is usually when a weaker phase for the S&amp;amp;P 500 begins. The weak period typically lasts until late August. The only exception is that mid-June to mid-July tends to see some strength, but overall not much progress is made during the summer months. This explains the trading expression “Sell in May and go away.”

In late-August stocks are often forming bottoms and starting to advance.

Mid-September to early October is also typically a weaker period.

It not until we get into October that prices really start to move out of the summer lull. Prices are typically strong through to the end of the year.",finance

CryptoCurrency,Why PoWers hate PoS?,"The whole point of crypto was to cut out middlemen, but PoW supporters would rather give the money to the middlemen who they have to go through to buy the mining equipment. 

With PoW, instead of investing in the blockchain to drive up market cap, you instead invest in some third parties that make the mining equipment. PoW only benefit miners, everyone else who invested into the blockchain are getting effed by new coins being mined aka inflation, but with PoS everyone gets the staking rewards to compensate. PoWers are just mad that now everyone can “mine” instead of a small group of “techies”. I’m a miner at heart but I want what’s best for the tech and everyone who invested and helping the blockchain reach its potential.

“BuT PoS mAkEs 51% aTtAcK eAsIeR”

PoS doesn’t make 51% attack easier or less expensive. When people invest directly into the blockchain instead of the money going to equipment manufacturers, the market cap rises, thus you’d need to have 51% or more of the entire market cap to execute the attack. Whereas PoW’s 51% attack is depending on factors outside of the blockchain’s control. Both PoS and PoW basically work the same way financially. More money = more mining power. It’s proportional to whatever you put in. You put in X amount you get Y amount in both consensus. But now everyone can participate. 

If we’re talking decentralization then PoS is where you’re gonna get it. PoW centralizes power to whoever has the most mining power - the Chinese can produce mining equipment cheaper, they have cheaper electricity, they can literally get the same mining power for a fraction of the cost of majority of miners elsewhere. This isn’t fair. With PoS, everyone can earn the same staking rewards, same APY, proportional to their investment, that’s a fair game that’s when it becomes more decentralized.

Give me more reasons why PoW is better than PoS please..",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,"With inflation rising, should I go for a longer term (5 year) fixed rate mortgage rather than shorter?","Basically, I'll be completing on a new build at the end of October.  


I have a mortgage application approved, which is at 3.34% fixed for 2 years. I could go with a similar deal for 5 years - these 2 deals allow for a 15% deposit (normally restricted to 20% for new builds for 90% of providers, at least in Northern Ireland) the cost of which is a slightly higher-than-usual interest rate and no ability to overpay the mortgage.  


My rationale in going for the 2 year fixed - as opposed to the 5 year - is that after 2 years I can overpay a bulk sum, and simultaneously hunt for (what I hope to be) much more competitive interest rates + an ability to overpay. This is because I won't be looking at a slim picking of mortgage offers due to my 15% deposit on a new build, like I am currently.

Anyhoo, with [interest rates spiking rather sharply recently](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-57490101) , I'm growing concerned. Yes, this could be temporary, but it could also be not! So I'm looking for opinions.  


**Should I stick to the existing plan of going for a 2 year fixed, and then getting a better offer (at least as far as the ability to overpay and better interest rate) after the 2 year term? And hope that interest rates don't screw me?**  


**Or should I take the hit on not being able to overpay, and a slightly meh interest rate (at least in the current market) and deal with it for 5 years, in the hope that if interest rates do spike sharply, I'll be sheltered from it?**  


Any opinions greatly appreciated!

Forex,Here is how I am trading GBP/USD the next week 📈,"Hi traders, here is my view on GBP/USD for the next week. For the full post with charts, please [click here](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/GBPUSD/CsIFpiWI-What-you-need-to-know-to-trade-GBP-USD-next-week/), as I am not able to add the charts to the right paragraph here on Reddit.

Let me know what's your view on GBP/USD.

**FUNDAMENTALS**:

Last week, the EU granted a delay to the chilled meat ban in Northern Ireland, which was one of the reasons for the pound to become quite resilient against most other major currencies, even against the USD bull. However, comments by Bank of England Governor Bailey who warned against a potential over-reaction to inflationary pressures put some selling pressure on GBP and lowered tightening expectations.

Still, the resilience of the GBPUSD pair, despite the rising cases of the Delta virus variant in the UK, shows that markets are still expecting a strong economic rebound in the country.

The US NFP beat estimates but a softer unemployment rate and unchanged wages encouraged USD bears to put some selling pressure on USD. The upcoming US Independence Day (US markets closed on Monday) and the recent USD strength also led to some profit-taking, which put further pressure on the USD.

Overall, markets will likely continue to price-in a Fed rate hike due to the stronger NFP while shaking off the weaker unemployment rate and unchanged wages. With the GBP well supported in the previous period, despite the Delta variant spread and Bailey's comments, markets will likely stick to their bullish GBP bias.

**Latest Headlines:**

Thursday at 15:00: USD Crude Oil Inventories (Expected: , Previous: -6.7M)

Friday at 10:00: GBP BOE Gov Bailey Speaks

&amp;#x200B;

**INTERMARKET:**

The recent increase in UST yields on the hawkish Fed shift pushed the 2-year US/UK yield differentials lower. Pound bulls need to keep an eye on this divergence as global yield-chasing could lead to selling pressure in the GBP/USD pair.

USD INDEX

The fall in the US yield curve (bull steepener) after the US labor market report will likely be short-lived due to the hawkish Fed. All eyes will be on the FOMC meeting minutes on Wednesday, especially on the arguing of the seven hawks who voted for a rate hike in 2022 on the Fed dot plot.

In the short-term, the picture looks bearish as the USD Index also broke below a rising trendline (next support at 91.50).

**SENTIMENT:**

CoT:

Hedge funds and other leveraged money increased their bearish GBP bets while long positioning remained almost unchanged. It's important to note that bullish bets are near 12-month extremes, or at least near the 90 percentile.

USD positioning (according to the USD value of contracts in other currencies) lies near short extremes. Even though bullish positioning increased in the previous week, there is still a possible risk of a short squeeze. This suggests that market positioning is somewhat bearish for GBP/USD .

Currency Strength Index:

Looking at the currency strength chart for the last 4 days, the USD sell-off on Friday pushed the USD significantly lower while the GBP remained almost range-bound.

The fall in US yields across the board could lead to a short-term correction in the USD, although - as mentioned earlier - I believe that markets will continue to price-in a rate hike for 2022 (the FOMC meeting minutes on Wednesday will be a key event for this.)

**TECHNICALS**

The GBPUSD pair broke above a bearish trendline on the 1-hour chart after facing some support at a long-term (daily) bullish trendline. The intraday bull run on Friday was accompanied by a surge in trading volume , signaling further upside potential during the next week (especially in combination with the picture in the USDx and US yields.)

**Levels to follow (Liquidity):**

Major resistance: 1.4000

Minor resistance: 1.3870

Minor support: 1.3815

Major support: 1.3730

personalfinance,State Tax Levy Question,"Hello Personal Finance, 

Long time reader first time poster. Hoping you all can help me. I recently noticed on my last two paychecks that they were short around $300 each. Looking into it, there is a state tax levy that is on them now. Having no idea what this was for, I reached out to my HR department and they were able to provide me the details. The levy was from a previous state I lived in back in 2016. Apparently I didn't file my state income tax that year. I have no idea why not. I have been filing my own taxes online for the last 12 or so years and even filed my Federal taxes in 2016 online, but for some reason I didn't submit my state taxes that year. Now up until the last two years (I'm making more money now) I have never owed money when filing my taxes. I have always received a refund when filing both state and federal taxes.  What's confusing me is that this tax levy says I owe the state of North Carolina over $4000. The document says I owe around $1800 in state taxes, $1800 in penalties and about $400 in interest.  

My question is, after usually never having owed additional money after filing my state taxes, why do I owe $1800? Is this because by not filing I have to repay them much of the state income tax? I thought state tax comes out of my paycheck and filing taxes is just recalculating if either owes the other additional money. $1800 seems like a lot. I've filed other years in North Carolina and never owed any money.

Additionally, this is the first time I'm hearing about any of this even though it was 5 years ago. Given I've moved 4 times since then and to different states, but had i heard about this i could have just cut a check for whatever I owed. Is there anything I can do about this or should I just go ahead and pay the levy in full and move on with my life, $4000 poorer? Thanks in advance!",finance

Do you honestly think that the market will sell off 50% or more?  I myself don't think that is realistic or that the Fed would even let it happen?

I'm obviously no market expert or economist, as I'm sure you can readily tell lol, but I think if we correct it would be more in the 10 to at most 15% range?

I would suspect that a 40 or 50% crash would ""kill"" the country in its current state? Meaning Americans would really be hurting economically.

personalfinance,What happens if I have medical debt in the USA and try to re-enter the country?,"In December 2018, a friend of mine was on holiday in Colorado and had a snowboarding accident. He was hospitalized for about two weeks and then discharged. The day after his release, he had a serious complication and was rushed back to the hospital by helicopter. A laparoscopy was performed and he lost a kidney. In all this, he didn't have any health insurance so he was charged unreasonable costs that he can't afford to pay (and will never be able to pay). On the advice of the local medical staff, he simply returned to his country without paying and has not received any particular requests since then, except sporadic emails from the hospital. To date, the situation remains unresolved and he would like to know the consequences of a possible return to the United States. 

I am not sure if cases like this are federal or state issues and if there is any time-limit for the case.

What could happen to him if he attempts to go back (not in Colorado but another State)?",finance

personalfinance,My case against IRAs,"I have decided to forgo completely IRA accounts in favor of a regular taxable brokerage account. I just want to make sure my reasoning is sound

Background
US federal Civilian employee, started working for uncle Sam when I was 22. Under my retirement rules, I will be eligible to retire at any age with 25 years of federal service (47years old), which I absolutely want to take advantage of. 

At 47, I will retire with a pension worth 50-60k/ year +COLA. I can start making TSP(government 401k equivalent) withdrawals at age 50 under special rules, whereas I still haveto wait untill 59.5 to pull IRAs.

I just don't see a senario where IRAs are helpful. I will be over 10 years into retirement but the time I can use an IRA. I plan on using the taxable brokerage to bridge the gap between 47-50 when I can start TSP withdrawals, or delay retirement untill 50 if needed.

Currently I contribute 9.5%(+5% agency match) to the tsp and 1% to the taxable account. I increase TSP by .5% every pay raise, keep taxable account at 1%. Once the TSP is maxed, then the extra .5% will go to the taxable account.

Not really worried about building huge amount of wealth, just want to build a comfortable retirement.

Am I missing anything?

personalfinance,Nervous First Time Homebuyers…,"Hi Everyone -

My fiancee (28F) and I (29M) are looking to become first time homebuyers! We’re actively pursuing a condo right outside of Boston MA (right on the public transit line) and I’d love your advice.

Right now, we collectively pay $2,750 for a condo that includes a parking space. This new home would require mortgaging $500,000 over 30 years with 5% down. From what I’ve calculated, our monthly payment, including interest and taxes that have a generous residential exemption, would be around $3,000. Do we take the plunge? If we continue to live where we are for the next three years, we’d either be paying our landlord over $90,000 or paying ourselves. 

We’ve created a pros and cons list, as follows: 

Pros
- Paying ourselves, not a landlord
- Garage parking with room for a 2nd
- Investment in a stable growing market  
- Potential for rental income in 5-7 years

Cons
- Lose 100 sq. ft.
- Financial flexibility (no lease to break)
- Cost (are we ready to spend $500k)
- Kitchen needs new countertops + cabinets 

The condo we’re evaluating is beautiful. It’s been very well maintained, it has an updated bathroom, stainless Bosch kitchen appliances (except refrigerator - needs replacing), new windows, and the HOA is reasonable at $350. I do want to note that the association just put in all new windows for every unit in the complex, so the balance sheet is currently negative for 2021, which isn’t great, but I’m not seeing it as a red flag.

As for the finances, our avg. collective income is about $155k. I have $15k in student loans currently, and have an Auto Loan of $21k. We’ve been approved for $500k with 5% down, so we’ll have PMI at about 0.5%. The pre-approved interest rate is 3.25% (which is a bit high but understandable given my new auto loan for our shared car as well as I also recently started a new job). Overall, I’ve projected our monthly payment, including taxes to be $3,000 or a little less. Closing costs will be around $8,000, but we’ll get about $4500 back as a family member is our realtor. Asking is $500k and it has been appraised at $496k.

We feel, along with our agent, that this is a great investment, but we’re still gawking at such a price tag at our age. We’re thinking to offer $10k under asking given the work needed, but we’ve been cautioned by our agent that it is priced already lower than it should be. I’d love some outside guidande. Thanks so much in advance!

[UPDATE: We backed away. Taking a more thorough inspection, we found a lot of water damage, shotty plumbing repair work and several other cringe worthy red flags. The unit needed about $50k in work and the seller wouldn’t budge on price. Thank you all so much for your feedback and advice!]",finance

personalfinance,Renting or buying while hoping to become parents,"Hello! A few questions here—thank you for your help! 

We’re currently able to put away 30%-40% of our income into a high yield savings account every month. We would like to buy a house in our city, and by my estimation we’d be paying $200-$300 less than our current monthly rent. We don’t love our apartment and it has electrical problems and pests. Our lease ends in four months and we potentially have the option to go month to month. It looks like by November we would easily have enough saved up for a 8-10% down payment on a house with a small leftover emergency fund of $5k that we’d need to rebuild; and with interest rates low I am keen to start looking. However, 1) we are trying to conceive our first child and 2) we need a new (used) car for my spouse pretty urgently, like in the next month, and will likely have to replace my car in the next three years. I have excellent credit and my husband has good credit that’s on the rise. By my math our expenses are low enough that we are prepared to handle these additions to our budget when they come, however I think the unpredictability of it (especially the constant unknown of “If I’m pregnant this month”) makes me hesitant. Even though it does look like it will be cheaper monthly to own a house in our city, I know there will be new expenses to account for beyond all the monthly payments. What are some factors/metrics I could use to help us in this decision that I’m overlooking? 

Additional info about potential baby and costs: I’d be the baby bearer and I’m also the higher earner; however my husband’s job has a lot of promotion/growth opportunities right now so that may change. Child care costs as much as a mortgage for many couples I know in our area; though we will fortunately only need 3 days a week and do have family who can help, it does look like we’ll only have 10% of our income leftover each month to save, once we have a kid in daycare.

investing,What type of bonds do you buy for a bond tent?,"One of the Sequence of Returns Risks mitigation strategies is to be heavy on equities going into retirement and then to build up a bond tent for the first few years of retirement before transitioning back to a larger equity position, to maintain capital through a longer retirement.

I suppose to an extent it depends on how long this bond tent is supposed to last, since you're supposed to buy bonds that match the duration you plan to hold them, but if so, doesn't this mean that you'd actually have to set up a sort of 'bond ladder tent' of ultra-short, short, and intermediate bonds, primarily treasuries, to keep you safe through the transition period? Or do you just buy intermediate treasuries and accept a potential loss selling a portion of them earlier than their duration match if something weird happens with interest rates during the first few years of your retirement?

&gt;In June of 2012, Barclays plc admitted that it had manipulated LIBOR—a benchmark interest rate that was fundamental to the operation of international financial markets and that was the basis for trillions of dollars of financial transactions. Between 2005 and 2009 Barclays, one of the world's largest and most important banks, manipulated LIBOR to gain profits and/or limit losses from derivative trades. In addition, between 2007 and 2009 the firm had made dishonestly low LIBOR submission rates to dampen market speculation and negative media comments about the firm's viability during the financial crisis.  In settling with U.K. and U.S. regulators the firm agreed to pay $450 million in fines. Within a few days of the settlement, Barclays' CEO, Robert Diamond, had resigned under pressure from British regulators.

# Introduction

Decentralized Finance (or simply DeFi) refers to the architecture of financial applications built on blockchain networks.

The main goal of Decentralized Finance is to create an open, free, and transparent ecosystem of financial services that is available to everyone and not controlled by a centralized government. Throughout Defi projects, users take full control of their assets and interact with the ecosystem through peer-to-peer (P2P) decentralized applications (dApps).

# Main Advantages Of DeFi

The conventional financial system is governed by banks serving as intermediaries and courts dealing with disputes.

DeFi apps do not need third parties. The users themselves manage all their funds while the software code specifies the settlement of any conceivable dispute. Nobody can arrest or freeze your assets. This approach reduces the cost of providing and using products and allows for a better financial system.

All data is recorded on the blockchain and distributed among... [read more!](https://guarda.com/academy/defi/what-is-defi/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=defi-whats-DEFI-advantages)

# The Role Of Smart Contracts In DeFi

The overwhelming majority of DeFi applications are based on smart contracts that use computer code to set conditions between entities. All terms are described in the code that ensures reliable execution and automation of business processes. Smart contracts are simple and fast, which also reduces the likelihood of adverse events for involved parties. However, computer code is susceptible to errors and vulnerabilities, and therefore confidential information locked in smart contracts can be at risk.

# Use Cases

**Decentralized Markets**

One of the most important features of DeFi is Decentralized Exchanges (DEX). It lets users trade digital assets without the involvement of a trusted third party to store their funds. Transactions are made directly between accounts using smart contracts.

These trading platforms do not require substantial technical maintenance, as compared to conventional exchanges, and offer lower transaction fees.

Blockchain technology can also be used with... [read more!](https://guarda.com/academy/defi/what-is-defi/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=defi-whats-DEFI-markets)

**Banking Services**

Since DeFi applications are financial, they include stablecoin issues, mortgages, and insurance.

The blockchain industry is paying more and more attention to stablecoins. This type of cryptocurrency is tied to real assets, such as Dollar, Euro, or even Bar of gold. Conventional cryptocurrencies are highly volatile, while decentralized stablecoins can be used as reliable digital assets that are not issued and controlled by centralized authorities.

By eliminating intermediaries and using... [read more!](https://guarda.com/academy/defi/what-is-defi/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=defi-whats-DEFI-markets)

**Loan And Credit**

Open lending protocols are among the most popular in the DeFi ecosystem. Open decentralized lending and borrowing have many advantages: instant transaction settlement, the ability to secure digital assets, no credit checks, etc. Lending services are built on public blockchains, minimize the trust they need, and ensure cryptographic verification methods. Blockchain credit marketplaces reduce counterparty risk, make loans and borrowings cheaper, faster, and more accessible to people. anyone can deposit money and earn interest rates from other members borrowing their funds. In the case of DeFi, all assets are digital. Smart contracts connect...

# DeFi Problems

The poor performance of the existing blockchains. Conventional blockchains are slower than centralized financial systems, leading to the creation of additional applications. DeFi application developers should optimize and customize their products in order to make them faster and more stable.

High risk of error for the consumer. The user is fully responsible for their digital assets. Neither the bank nor any other trusted party is concerned for the loss or theft of your finances. Minimize the risk of a user’s error is a very important task.

Finally, using DeFi applications requires experience, since... [read more!](https://guarda.com/academy/defi/what-is-defi/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=defi-whats-DEFI-priblems)

# Conclusion

DeFi is an independent financial environment, that allows for the management of new financial instruments. DeFi apps are not controlled by conventional financial and political structures. This feature makes it possible to build a more transparent financial system and get rid of censorship. The characteristics of the used blockchains are essential to the development of decentralized open financial products. How successful and effective this financial system will be and when DeFi can become mainstream is not yet clear.",cryptocurrency
CryptoCurrency,Some real world inflation data for you for when the dips cause fud,"So in November I’ll have been at my job 20 years.  When I started, the average pay for the bottom rung position was $6-$6.50 per hour depending on experience.  A pack of Marlboro would run you $2.72, (and you could often get buy one get one deals.). A bottle of soda was 89 cents, a Hershey bar was 59 cents, and a new car would run you somewhere between $10 and $12 grand for a small sedan.

Fast forward to the prices today:  We are starting kids in Highschool with no job experience at $13 minimum and most with some experience make $14-$15.  A pack of Marlboro is $12.78. Yes, some of that is from state and federal tax increases, but, certainly not $9 worth.)That Hershey bar? It’s $1.79 and 30% smaller.  The same soda is $2.19.  A new car?

MachineLearning,[D] Using GAN to enhance VQVAE auto encoder.,"I have a VQVAE model that is producing reasonable sound using just a straight forward multi spectral loss function similar to than in the parallel wave gan ([https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.11480.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.11480.pdf)).  While it does sound like the original audio it is far from perfect and kind of crackly.  To address this I have been working on adding the adversarial component to my model.  My model is as follows...

Raw Audio -&gt; Encoder -&gt; Codebook -&gt; Decoder -&gt; Discriminator + Multi Spectral Loss

The loss function is a combination of the multispectal loss, and adversarial loss (I am using Least Squares GAN.)  The issue I keep running into is that one of the loss terms tends to dominate the other depending on how I weight them.  If I use a weight of 4 for the adversarial term (as suggested in the paper) my model tends to ignore its inputs and just converge on something else.  If I lower the weight of the adversarial loss my discriminator can perfectly differentiate real/fake, and the decoder never manages to overcome this.

What I would like is to have only an adversarial loss for my decoder.  However, the issue here is that the discriminator is only being asked to tell real vs fake. What I really want it to discern is whether the generated audio matches that of the input.  So at first I thought of maybe using an autoencoder as part of my discriminator which would be fed the original sample.  This way the discriminator could be conditioned on what the generator should sound like.  Then I thought more about it and decided against this.  What I figured is the discriminator could learn something like a hash function for the original sound and use that to perfectly tell apart real/fake despite having the bottle neck.  Also I think I would need to balance the amount of information the discriminator and decoder gets since with this architecture the decoder can only be as good as what the discriminator can teach it.

After some more thought I came up with the following idea...

First I would train a normal non-adversarial model using just multi spectral loss like I had done before.

Raw Audio -&gt; Encoder -&gt; Codebook -&gt; Decoder -&gt; Multi Spectral Loss

Then I would take just the Encoder/Codebook part, and use these codes to condition both the generator and discriminator of a GAN.  Note that the weights for the encoder are frozen at this point and will no longer be updated.

CryptoCurrency,"Know your enemy. Who is going to make you lose your funds, and how are they going to do it.","I've worked it out to 5 enemies that are the biggest threat to your funds.

I've been in crypto for over 8 years, and I've seen all the security issues over the years, heard all the stories of people losing their funds, and have run into several security issues of my own.

The big scary stories we hear in the media is always about how some super-hacker is going to steal your funds by typing really hard on their keyboard. Or someone breaking into your house and looking for where you ""hide your Bitcoins"". But that's actually not likely to be how you lose your funds.

These are the ones you really need to watch out for:

1-**Phishing**. It's the most popular among thieves, simply because it's the easiest. It can take the shape of an email seemingly for an exchange or a hardware wallet like Ledger/Trezor, asking you for your credentials.

Sometimes phishing can be sneaky. It can take the form of an Amazon online order. It's not always going to be an email either. It can be someone impersonating a mod on here, or really take about any form.

Nobody is ever gonna ask you for a your recovery seed phrase. So if someone asks you that, you know it's a scam.

2-**API keys** are another big enemy. That's something you set up on an exchange to give access to a 3rd party software for instance. Sometimes you do need to use them. But make sure you don't allow them to execute trades or withdraw funds. Sometimes if you use trading bots, then you do need them to do that. That's where hackers can use exploits, which can be done by selling you malicious bots.

3-**Fake sites and fake apps** Another enemy are those shady apps in Apple and Android stores, or sometimes you may download a fake wallet for your phone, or a fake GUI for a Monero wallet for instance, or for 3rd party all for Trezor. Sometimes it's even the entire site that has been spoofed. One common way they trap you to fake sites is through Google ads, which lists the fake sites at a top of a search.

4-**Exchanges** While they are no longer flimsy in security like in the past, and are getting harder to hack, the issue with exchanges is not so much hackers any more, but bugs, bad customer assistance, and poor teams and management. Those are still capable of losing your funds, locking you out, scamming you, or shutting down.

5-**Yourself** Of all the ways you can lose your funds, this is actually your biggest enemy. It's probably the most common way people lose their funds, and now accounts for almost 20% of all existing Bitcoin being lost forever.

""Yourself"" is also the longest list of different ways to lose your funds. A lot of those fall under user error. But you can also be your own biggest enemy in poor decision making.

People losing their funds is not always about forgetting a password or sending funds to the wrong address. It also takes the form of falling for scams too easily, or simply putting your money in the wrong project and buying things like Iron Titanium. Or putting money in the right project, and pulling out at the bottom of the first dip.

And when it comes to security, it's not always a case of losing funds to thin and flimsy security. People have lost their funds for also having too much security, and locking themselves out of their funds with no backup.

Use those 5 different areas as a guide to start evaluating your security, and see how you can better protect yourself for what I see as the 5 biggest enemies of your funds' safety.

If you have other enemies you personally find as a bigger threat, feel free to comment about it.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Considering taking a loan (EU),"Hi everyone, 

I am considering taking a car loan (EU), however given the uncertainty with interest rates, I am looking at different options.

The interest rate is 1,3 % plus 3-month EURIBOR. The loan can be paid back up to 10 years.

Given such low interest, the initial idea was to borrow the full amount and pay back over the period of 9 years.

However, I also considered to borrow a partial amount and pay in back sooner, in 5 years or so.

Any thoughts?",finance
personalfinance,Sanity Check - Building 2nd home in another state,"Would love another set of eyes on something we’re almost certainly going to do. Relevant info:

Income 

~$300K base, ~$50K bonus annually

Assets

401Ks ~$725K
Roth IRAs ~$150K
General brokerage accounts ~$550K
Primary residence ~$500K of equity 

(High level) monthly expenses
$3K/mortgage
$2.7K/daycare (2 kids, one has 2 more years of daycare, other has 4 more)
$800/utilities
$700/529 plans (2)
$4Kish (varies) on credit cards, no balance carried, paid off monthly

No student loans (anymore)/car payments. 

Anyway, we’re looking at buying a tear down in FL, on the water, and building new. Tear down would be $575K, would buy all cash with another couple, so each would be putting up $300K (would sell out of a portion of the “general brokerage” account noted above, all LTCGs, if it matters). 

Construction financing for the 12 month build (which would take 6 months to get started, plans/permitting etc), so month 18 before we have a CO. ~$800K estimated build cost, plus the $575K for the land, and since nothing is ever on budget, we’re assuming a total cost of $1.5M when all said and done. Refi to perm financing at month 18 and leverage up to 80% LTV so equity invested goes from $300K/each to $150K/each. 

Would use it 5-6 times a year (likely more with post-COVID flex work policies), and based on modeled cash flows would be close to break even renting it at 80% occupancy with 20% going to a management company. 

This is not a “is this profitable” exercise, we’re fine being net negative yearly cash flow wise, as we’re 1) using it a good bit and 2) hopefully seeing some appreciation over time (long term hold, we’re all late 30’s). 

More just looking for a unbiased second set of eyes for any variables we’re missing. The risk of interest rates changing between now and today + 18 months is my biggest worry, but it is what it is.

Forex,The Power of Intermarket Analysis in Forex Trading,"Intermarket analysis is an often neglected and overlooked type of analysis among traders. However, it's a powerful tool that can help you anticipate future price movements by following the performance of other, closely-related markets.

Intermarket analysis refers to the analysis of other asset classes that can provide valuable and actionable insights into related markets, such as forex.

In this part of our Intermarket analysis lesson, we'll be focusing on a specific asset class that has a very close connection with currencies: the sovereign bond market and yields.

As you already know from my previous educational posts, currencies tend to follow interest rates. With the fall of the Bretton Woods agreement, currencies became freely-floating and capital started to move to places with the highest yields, which meant higher returns for investors.

For example, if Australia has a 3% interest rate and Japan a 1% interest rate, investors could buy AUD to collect a 3% rate and short JPY by paying a 1% rate, leaving them with a net profit of 2%. This is how carry trade work, and the long AUD/JPY was one of the most popular carry trades given the large yield differential between Australia and Japan.

That's why you need to follow yield differentials in your trading. The chart above shows the EUR/USD pair, and the 2-year yield differentials between 2-year German bonds and 2-year US bonds. Notice that we're using German bonds (also known as ""bunds""), since Germany is the largest European economy.

To add yield differentials to your chart, simply hit the ""+"" (compare) above your chart and type in ""DE02Y - US02Y"" with a space between the symbols. This also works for other currencies. Here is a list of symbols for the major currencies and their respective bond yields: US02Y, CA02Y, GB02Y, DE02Y, JP02Y, AU02Y, and NZ02Y. The currency should be self-explanatory from the symbols (note, we also use the German 2-year yield when analyzing CHF.)

Notice how the exchange rate closely followed the differentials in yields. When German yields rose compared to US yields, capital inflows to the euro area increased demand for EUR, which lifted the exchange rate.

Similarly, when US yields rose compared to German yields, capital inflows to the US increased demand for USD, and the EUR/USD pair fell (meaning a stronger USD.)

The dots you see on the chart are the individual bond yields (DE02Y and US02Y), because I like to have a picture of why the yield differential line is rising or falling (i.e., did the line fall because US yields are higher, or because German yields are lower?)

We are using the 2-year yields, because they tend to closely follow the monetary policy stance of the respective central bank. In other words, when the ECB turns hawkish, the DE02Y tends to rise (signaling higher interest rate expectations), which in turn would push the yield differential line higher (and most likely the EUR/USD pair as well.)

In the next part of Intermarket Analysis, we'll take a look at how other markets can impact currencies, like metals, commodities, and energy.

personalfinance,Closed on house now lender wants to rework PPW,"So full story.  TLDR; at bottom

I was doing my DD and trying to get the best rates while shopping for me new house.  I was fortunate in moving from Florida and rolled all my equity into new home.  Trying to pay off quickly and avoid interest I also went with a 15yr fixed in the process and one lender I found was offering 2.15% after speaking with a few.  

Last minute a chance to go with the builders preferred lender with 5K towards closing cost is presented.  Seemed like a sweeter deal interest rate wasn't quite as appealing but I have hopes to pay off house in 3-5 years so the extra money on a smaller loan (115K) seemed like best option.  

This lender though wasn't the best at communication through the process.  She suggests instead of the 2.625%(I think) with her 2500 to use it for points to buy down the interest rate instead and keep the 2500 on the builder side.  I say yes and new paperwork comes I sign it with 2.15% which was what I had anyway, cool.

Fast forward to closing sign a billion pages everything is paid and goes smoothly.  Then the lender who returns says that her side included the points and 2500 and we need to pay 2500 and redo all the paperwork.

Builder still hasn't fixed all the issues that they agreed too and have gone unresponsive and we have owned the house now for 3weeks.  

Anyways, how do I proceed and am I liable to do this at all after completing the paperwork already?

TLDR; Closed on house lender wants to redo paperwork due to mistake on her end and it will cost me another 2500",finance

personalfinance,How can I start making better money moves?,"I just started a new job and am making more money ($47,114 per year/~1515.03 per check), but it also feels like I am still just barely scraping by in terms of debt and expenses. I have to go back to school for my job, which is going to cost $10,500 per year. Luckily, $9,000 of it will be reimbursed by my job and I’m trying to cover that $10,500 with loans.

My current expenses are:

- Rent: ~$1,300 including water/sewer/trash

- Phone: $46.44 per month

- Internet: $45.93 (necessary for school)

- Car Insurance: $130.50

- Car Payment: $182.31

- Discover: $117

- Electric: ~$40 per month

- Apple Music: $5.42

- Student Loan: $111.37

- Food: ~$100 per month

- Gas: ~$70 per month

- Misc: $50 per month

First thing I’m going to do tomorrow is find a place that can shop car insurances for me to find a cheaper option (I currently have Progressive). I’ve also considered trying to refinance my auto loan because I was told my APR percentage was high since I’ve never had a big loan like this before. My student loan payment should also be going away soon since I’m applying for deferment/cancelation as a teacher. I am also going to open an account with a bank that gives $250 for direct deposit, which isn’t much, but it’s something.

But I just need to start getting ahead on my debts and saving. My Discover card has $5,815 on it at 17.99%. One of my student loans is $9,349 at 5% interest, and then I have other student loans through the government that total $24,597 with varying interest rates. My sister keeps telling me I should open up a new credit card and do a balance transfer to rid myself of the interest on my current one. My student loans will go into forbearance soon as well since I’m back in school, so they’ll at least stop accruing interest, but still. I’ve also thought about trying to withdraw from my 403B to cover some expenses, but I really don’t want to.

After expenses, I’ll have about $740 per month, and that’s if I stick to all of my numbers. I really don’t want to get a second job what with teaching and going to school, but I might just have to. Any advice, anything I could do or consider, please send my way because I really don’t want to be drowning in debt for the next decade.",finance

CryptoCurrency,Where I think banking and crypto will mix,"I figure I might as well put this out there since I know there is a lot of push about big bank bad. But I'm not 100% sure that is causing the majority of our problems. I think it's old money.

Anyways, where do I see banking and crypto in the future?

&amp;#x200B;

I think just like how you can store your $ with a bank, you will be able to store your crypto with a bank. And like what we are seeing in some places like Coinbase, you will have a debt card and when you buy it will just swap the crypto to $.

&amp;#x200B;

Keep in mind the not your keys not your wallet thing. But note that does apply to your $ you keep in the bank. At any time the bank, the gov, etc can freeze your money in a bank, a glitch can happen (keep in mind the bank is insured), or many other problems can happen. So this is already a problem with the $, but people keep their money in a bank because of a number of reasons

&amp;#x200B;

* The bulk of the time it's safer and easier to deal with FOR THE AVERAGE PERSON
* You can buy things with a debt card vs carrying your cash around (or in this case crypto)
* Assuming banks can get federal protection on crypto like they do with the $ then there is that

&amp;#x200B;

What about loans and staking?

&amp;#x200B;

I can see it that staking being a thing with banks like you see on exchanges. Even more now with most crypto you can lock and unlock without any wait time. It maybe possible if say you can get 5% from your own wallet or exchanges, you will get 2.5% through using them, and they pocket the other half.

As far as loans (where banks make the bulk of their money) I think just like the $ you store in the bank. The bank will put your crypto up for a DeFi. Now here is the iffy part. Will the bank make it where you can put your own crypto up for DeFi and do all of that? Or will the bank itself just use your coins and keep any earnings? I'm very sure the path they will go down is they will keep all the earnings.

&amp;#x200B;

I know a lot of people might not like this. But this might not be a bad thing at the end because that means more people will hold crypto and our value will skyrocket. NOTE: I don't think the banks will hold all crypto. I could be wrong, but I'm sure what will end up happening is it will be the major ones and anything on the ETH and BNB chain. Maybe other chains if they become popular (like lets say if TRX starts getting more on it's chain and TRX gets super popular)

&amp;#x200B;

NOTE: I think we won't be forced to use a bank just like now where you're not really forced to use one with the $. And I think things like coinbase where there is no fee (I believe there thing is basically a debt card). This will make it where we really don't need a bank since we can just move whatever amount to coinbase when needed.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Lastly, note this is my opinion.",cryptocurrency

Let's go...

Newly covered today: 

1. The Cardano Foundation has released a video on its short and long-term strategies to get to one billion users by 2026. [https://twitter.com/CardanoStiftung/status/1412137365318127626](https://twitter.com/CardanoStiftung/status/1412137365318127626)

Previously Covered but still interesting:

1. Manuel Chakravarty gave a big update on Hydra (layer 2 scaling). Hydra will not require that the base layer be modified since it will be implemented via Plutus smart contracts. Hydra is actually a collection of protocols including Hydra Head and Hydra Tail. Hydra Head is a symmetric protocol where multiple participants will be online simultaneously for the whole period of the head exchanging messages. Hydra Tail is an asymmetric protocol involving a high performance server and many clients that may be mobile and could be offline for large portions of the tail’s existence. There will also be “inter head &amp; tail networking” which will allow for a network of heads and tails. They have a published research paper on Hydra Head. They are currently writing the Hydra Tail paper.
2. Hydra is distinguished from other layer 2 protocols by its isomorphic properties. This means you will be able to run any smart contract that works on the base layer in a Hydra Head! This is very special. We won’t need special purpose contracts built out just for layer 2. There are some big implications to this. Since a Hydra Head is essentially just a Plutus smart contract, this means you can run a Hydra Head inside another Hydra Head. It’s turtles all the way down, guys. It sounds like they can do this iteratively as much as they want.
3. Aggelos also gave a good presentation on the importance of “skin in the game” in resource based consensus protocols (both proof-of-work and proof-of-stake) and its effect on promotion or discouragement of centralization. He explained how Ouroboros has built-in safeguards to prevent centralization including the K parameter (currently at 500) which caps total rewards per pool and the alpha parameter (currently at 0.3) which splits rewards into a 77% piece and a 23% piece. A pool can take its share of the 77% piece based on the pool’s total stake and its share of the 23% piece based on the pledge of the SPO. A higher alpha parameter makes it less attractive for individual SPOs to proliferate multiple pools since they can’t be as leveraged on their available pledge and still get as big a share of the 23% piece. This also discourages Sybil Attacks. As Cardano on-chain governance progresses, these parameters will be controlled by the community.
4. There will be a Cardano Goguen Summit in September. It will be hybrid digital/in-person.
5. Charles is helping to bring the cryptographer who broke SHA-1 to the University of Wyoming. The Cardano funded blockchain lab there could be on the road to be a powerhouse.

We also learned exactly how Mithril is going to work. [https://youtu.be/LhepJFCyWRk](https://youtu.be/LhepJFCyWRk)
9. In proof-of-work, bootstrapping can be done with blockheaders. This won’t do in proof-of-stake since we need information about stakeholder distribution to confirm block validity.
10. Mithril fixes this by being a cryptographic construction that enables a population of stakeholders to issue a signature consistent with certain constraints.
11. For Mithril to work in proof-of-stake, it needs three crucial properties: 1) it needs to enforce a threshold ratio of stakeholders before the signature is issued; 2) the pre-signature fragments must be independently verified and subject to public aggregation; and 3) it must be efficient in the sense that the final signature is of constant size and is logarithmically dependent on the # of stakeholders.
12. Stakeholders will issue special Mithril keys along with the normal cryptographic key material. Then at regular intervals, full nodes will test whether they can produce a pre-signature fragment. Only a random subset of stakeholders will be eligible to produce a pre-signature fragment. When a sufficient # of pre-signature fragments have been issued by eligible stakeholders then it will be possible to aggregate the fragments into a final signature.
13. This will be a checkpoint that will be verifiable with respect to previous check points all the way back to the genesis block. Such checkpoints will be cryptographic commitments of the relevant UTXOs.
14. Since the checkpoints will be trustless, a light client (i.e. wallet) will only need to verify the sequence of checkpoints up to the current time to trustlessly bootstrap.

23. Vitalik is saying it’s highly unlikely we see ETH 2.0 before late 2022. I’m guessing that means mid 2023 which will be after two years of Cardano slaughtering the entire ETH user base. Things are looking so bad that Vitalik says he doesn’t even like using the ETH 2.0 label anymore since he knows the changes will be more incremental. This is what early capitulation sounds like guys.

57. Hedgefund Billionaire Paul Tudor Jones tells the world to buy crypto and certain other assets if the Fed doesn’t address inflation in their policy meeting that concludes on Wednesday. JP Morgan’s Jamie Dimon concurs that the current inflation is very likely not transitory. This could be tremendously good timing for Cardano given our top five status and the impending mainnet launch of smart contracts.

70. Bloomberg just published a piece called “America Should Become a Nation of Renters”. While this statement is probably extremely polarizing for Americans, it can also be argued that the death of homes as the primary investment vehicle of Americans may open up a new wave of adoption in crypto as an alternative.

74. It looks like the second biggest ETH stakepool or it's custody provider has lost it’s users private keys to $75MM in ETH. Cardano doesn’t have this problem. We get to keep custody of our crypto because we found a better way than slashing.

77. The June Cardano 360 is currently available on Youtube. [https://youtu.be/al5m14299ww](https://youtu.be/al5m14299ww)
78. We saw segments on various newer partner entities like Nervos, Orion Protocol, and Revuto. Nervos is a UTXO proof-of-work blockchain which is building a cross-chain bridge with Cardano so that you can use your ADA on Nervos dApps and vice versa. Interoperability is a big theme for Nervos and they plan to have a working testnet within a month. Orion Protocol is building a terminal that will allow for decentralized non-custodial trading across centralized and decentralized exchanges. They say this would not require you to KYC or even have an account with any of these exchanges. Revuto is an online subscription management service that recently completed a $10MM token sale on Cardano.
79. It was also revealed that Wolfram Labs, COTI, and IOHK have a three-way partnership (a ménage à tech) to build an NFT auction site. The people from Wolfram were talking about very interesting things including live minting during streaming events and automated upload to IPFS. COTI will be building out auction and bidding mechanisms in ADAPay.
80. Professor Aggelos Kiayias gave us an update on research including that Ouroboros Chronos and Hydra papers have both been accepted into conferences/journals. Chronos will provide Cardano with a global concept of time that doesn’t rely on any outside timekeeper. Prof. Kiayias also pointed out that Hydra is distinguishable from other layer two protocols in that the scripting language is identical to that of the base layer in Cardano such that any dApp that can run on Cardano will run on the Hydra L2. This is a huge plus and superior to many other layer two solutions in other ecosystems where the base layer dApps will not run on layer two. Finally, the Mithril paper has been submitted for peer review. It will provide Cardano light wallets with Succinct Non-interactive Arguments of Knowledge that will give us the best of both worlds: no delays for syncing as in full node wallets while still preserving trustlessness.
81. Finally, the Goguen Summit will be in late September. Sign up now at [summit.cardano.org](http://summit.cardano.org/).
82. The Fed is once again STRONGLY signalling to us that they are going to regulate stablecoins. The Fed is also specifically calling out Tether for the first time. You need to be thinking about how stablecoin regulation might affect your favorite Cardano DeFi or other project.

83. People are starting to realize that the Stakehound private key loss in ETH may attract unwanted regulatory attention to Ethereum 2.0 while this problem could never have occurred in Cardano. Also, only a few days later another ETH stakepool (this time SharedStake...the sixth biggest ETH Stakepool) allegedly experiences a rugpull that some are valuing at over $30MM. This is another problem that could not happen in Cardano staking. It feels like we stepped into the ring, they rang the bell, and ETH just started punching itself in the head. Eventually it’s going to KO itself.

CryptoCurrency,Why Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDC) are not the same as Cryptocurrencies.,"There are many pros and cons to the Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) economy. Jumping to conclusions based on incomplete understanding of the CBDC world is rife, especially since misinformation abounds and not much has been made public about the launch of the CBDCs by some of the economic giants in the world. This brief overview helps bridge this gap.

###So What Is a CBDC?
A CBDC is a digital currency that is owned entirely by the state, with no intermediary banks or financial institutions between the citizens and the Central Bank. Fiat currencies, though regulated by central banks, are not directly operated by the central banks--there are other banks and financial institutions which interface between the central bank and the citizens for all purposes.
Though fiat currencies are just as often transacted ""digitally"" as they are in cash, they are not ""digital currencies"" because the digital transactions are not independent of the fiat currency--the commercial banks need to generate (as in a loan) or account for (in a transaction) the requisite fiat money, and report it back to the central banks. Maintaining the books for these transactions, online and offline, is the job of the commercial banks. A digital currency like CBDC, on the other hand, is a true digital entity, in that it has no physical presence. It is controlled in entirety by central banks, removing commercial banks out of the picture altogether.
So CBDCs are in effect the complete opposite of cryptocurrencies, in that they are completely centralized and give the governments autonomy over not just the economy, but in the way the digital currency is used by people.

###Can CBDCs Solve Financial Problems?
CBDCs can solve some financial problems, but not all, and might exacerbate some other problems depending on the way they are rolled out.

###Lower Transaction and Printing Costs
Since CBDCs are completely on-chain, without a physical component, the money supply is controlled digitally. The costs of printing paper money are eliminated in a world of CBDCs. The commercial banks being eliminated from the cycle of transaction as well, the overall transaction costs and transaction time can also be sizably reduced. Interest rates, financial lending, all will be controlled directly by the state, and the costs associated with the same will also be reduced.

###Counterfeit Currency Problem Solved
Many countries, especially developing countries with active criminal lobbies, face a serious problem of counterfeit currency notes. In the year 2016, India launched a Demonetization program to dissolve the black markets that thrive on black money and fake currency notes.

Leaving aside the success or failure of the said program, the problem of counterfeit currency is real, and not yet completely solved.
CBDCs would solve this problem by eliminating the paper currency printing machinery. Since all the control and power rests with the central bank, and transactions happen on an immutable blockchain, counterfeit currency problem is solved to a great extent.

###Countering Banking Sector Fraud
It is well known that the 2008 financial crisis was brought on by terrible mortgage financing of commercial banks, which cascaded into a worldwide financial crisis, leading to millions out of jobs, suicides, depression and economies facing serious challenges for growth.
The havoc caused by banks due the power vested in them is not small. By centralization of the currency, the problems due to human errors and frauds in commercial banks can be reduced to some extent.

###Better Data, Better Analytics, Better Microeconomic Research
In a world where all currency is digital, with complete access of its movements in the hands of a central bank, on the blockchain, there will never be a problem of access to data, authenticity of data and microeconomic planning and research.
A lot of microeconomic field experiments are not practically possible due to the nature of fiat currency and hurdles in logistical planning. With a CBDC, this is ruled out. Research and better insight into the economy are a side effect of having the currency on a blockchain.

##Does CBDC Create Some Problems?
As a digital currency controlled and backed by the state, a CBDC suffers with many of the problems of the fiat currency. Unlike cryptocurrencies where there is no single controlling power or decision-maker, the CBDCs follow the diktats of the state, and are an extension of the policies of the state, an instrument for their purpose.

###Inflation
There is a big question mark on whether the central governments which regulate the digital currencies will make the blockchain public or not. It cannot be public in entirety, because of privacy concerns, but at the same time, the lack of transparency gives the state complete freedom and license to increase or decrease the money supply as they want. This means that the fundamental problem of inflation does not get eliminated. It only changes its shape. In fact, now it is even easier to increase money supply since money does not need to be printed. It need only be coded.

###Censor All You Want
This centralization also gives the state the license to monitor every single transaction of the citizens, from buying groceries to books to buying companies.
So, in the future, if the government decides to become totalitarian or wants to push a certain ideology on the people, they can assume total power over the financial system, allowing them unprecedented freedom to censor and ban anything they want--because money plays a role in everything that happens in a country.
If the government ""programs the money"" so that it cannot be used for certain transactions, there is nothing a user can do to get around it.

###What About the Banking Jobs
This is a question that goes around every time a disruptive technology promises to change the world we live in. If we do away with the banks, what happens to the people who work there--especially the CXOs and the billionaires? They won't disappear, ofcourse.
They will get absorbed into the new system, in one role or the other. The next 10 years may see this changeover with much resistance from every corner. The people required to work in the digital economy will need to have a different set of skills as compared with their banking counterparts.
This is a huge change, and not one that can happen quickly. It's a cultural change. If there are frequent changes in government policies during this period, this changeover promises to be messy.

###Cyber Attacks
There is also the question of cyber attacks which could possibly hack into and disrupt the functioning of an entire country. It depends on what technology is used to build a CBDC, but if there is even the slightest possibility of a cyber attack, the currency could possibly face devaluation, cause panic among people, and lead to unforetold problems.
In this sense, Bitcoin, which has survived everything thrown at it for years together, is a far more stable, time-tested and tamper-proof currency than a new CBDC.

##CBDCs Are Not a Replacement for Cryptocurrencies!

CBDCs are the peak of centralization. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are the maximum decentralization reasonably possible for humanity. For this fact alone, CBDCs cannot replace cryptocurrencies. All big economies are progressing towards their own CBDCs by leaps and bounds. China has even rolled out trials to more than half a million people.

But there will always be a need for freedom, for independence and for being censorship-resistant--that's what cryptocurrency gives you. With all its pluses and minuses, the remainder of a CBDC still cannot replace a Bitcoin.

CryptoCurrency,Germany’s New Cryptocurrency Law Welcomes $145 Billion BTC Investments - This might just be the boost the cryptocurrency market needs right now.,"In a massive move forward for cryptocurrency, Germany has passed a new law called the Fund Location Act that implies all specialized investment funds can invest up to 20% of their US$ 2 trillion assets in cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin.

Bundestag, a house in the German parliament, first proposed the law in April and now the bill has become the law. This new law is a great power move as it will bring a large share of Germany’s financial capital into the cryptocurrency industry. According to some market experts, this law can bring US$415 billion in potential crypto investments.

While the UK is tightening its grip on cryptocurrency, the rest of the European countries, including Germany, is curiously interested. They’re quickly trying to form crypto regulations and BaFin, the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority of Germany has now licensed CoinBase exchange for all the crypto operations in the country.

Deutsche Bank decided to adopt cryptocurrency assets this year as the country’s economists predicted the adverse effects of USD’s inflation. The bank believes that Bitcoin is too important to be ignored. Deutsche Bank also announced that it will offer custody and brokerage services to its institutional clients.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Insurance (AIG) refusing to pay out on a canceled hotel reservation.,"So, a few months ago I made a reservation on hotels.com (I know - I now know I shouldn't have used them) for a hotel for a concert we were going to see.  Two rooms, one night.   When I made the reservation, hotels.com has this pop-up that the room is non-refundable, so if I'm not 100% sure, I need to purchase this cancellation travel insurance as an add-on.  Made the reservation when Covid was still very alive, so it seemed like a good idea.  The notes about the insurance lists terms like ""100% guaranteed"" and ""cancel for any reason"", so I assume I'm all good.  

In May, we receive notice that the concert has been cancelled due to Covid, so I tried to cancel my reservations.  Hotels.com says that I need to cancel my reservation and then submit a claim to AIG, which I do.  After supplying far too much documentation, several weeks later I get an email from AIG saying that my claim has been denied, because basically, ""Cancellation of the event isn't a good enough reason"".  I've been back and forth with hotels.com for weeks - originally they said they'd refund me, but then said they'd only refund me if the hotel refunded the money to them.  After speaking to the hotel, they send info saying they never received a dime from hotels.com, as my cancellation was far enough out before the check-in..  

My next step was to dispute it with Amex, as I used my Amex card to make the reservation.  Amex initially reversed the charges, but the other day, I get a notice that they've been reinstated, since hotels.com (Expedia) said my dispute should be with AIG, not hotels.com - and Amex has agreed with them.  

I just don't understand how AIG can decline this and at this point, the reservation has passed and I'm on the hook for $500 for something I never received..  I don't have much in the way of social media or a way to complain and so far, all of my complaints have fallen on deaf ears.  Any suggestions on how to right this?  

TL;DR - got stiffed on travel insurance from AIG on a reservation I made through hotels.com - both companies are complicit, not sure how to go about getting a refund.",finance

## Summary if you don’t want to read a lot

CPR has some good things going for it, but in general the outlook is bland.  They have some deep problems, and they don’t manage money well.  Rating: Do not buy, but maybe hold.

## Company Summary

Canadian pacific is a transcontinental railway headquartered in Calgary, Alberta and founded in 1881.  They transport bulk commodities, merchandise freight, and retail goods.  They also are engaged in marine shipping, although this is a secondary business.  They have 13,000 Miles of track across North America and own 22.9K freight cars and lease 12.2K.  They own 1336 Locomotives and lease 76.

I grew up with someone whose dad was an engineer for them.  He said they treated him like shit and he was never home to spend time with my friend.  I think his job at CPR was the reason he divorced his wife.  Workers are non unionized. This goes to show that CPR can make the most out of their workers.

They have one operating segment: rail transportation.  The subsegments of this are bulk commodities, merchandise freight and intermodal traffic (transported multiple ways like train -&gt; boat).

**Management Overview:**

The CEO has been in the business for 29 years. Only 55% of employees approve of him on glassdoor.  The CFO has over 20 years of experience but there is something wrong with his teeth.  The sentiment from glassdoor is that there is no respect for employees, especially at the lower level.  The management has done a good job keeping the company running well, but they are neglecting their human capital.  I have nothing bad to say about the COO.  He seems well qualified and his teeth are more normal.

**Board Overview:**

[LINK](https://www.cpr.ca/en/about-cp/board-of-directors)

The board looks like the husbands and wives of wealthy politicians who all meet up once a week to play bridge.  Only 411 have past railway experience.  There are a lot of finance people on the beard, which is good and bad.  On one hand they will have good advice on capital structure, but less on general operations.  

## Company history

They have a long complicated history that includes a lot of death and a lot of labour so dangerous and cheap it was pretty much slavery. But all of that history won’t have much impact on current operations.

In 2020, they acquired the Central Maine and Quebec railway.  This added 481 Miles to their track.

In the third quarter of 2020, they acknowledged climate change.

In 2020 they announced that they would be working on the development of a hydrogen locomotive.  If it gets working, they will have to retrofit old locomotives with the new technology.  I am not sure how cost effective this is.

They recently bid and failed to buy Kansas city southern.  I see this as a big loss.  This could have brought their track miles up to almost 20000 and would give them a line direct from canada through to mexico.  It would have been a 25 Billion dollar deal.

## Risk

When I think about risk I tend to not look at the risk section in a 10K right away.  CPR talked about the risk of transporting hazardous goods, environmental stuff, terrorism and war before they talked about supply chain and human capital risk.  Seriously!  If one of their trains blows up, they might lose 4 engineers, 100M of goods and assets, and cause 200M in damage MAX.  This money doesn't mean anything to them.  They're just trying to follow the trend of hyping up pointless risks while downplaying the real ones.  The risks below are all from me, not from what the company has put in their risk section.

CPR is uniquely exposed to economic risk.  Its business is directly dependent on supply and demand.  In prosperous times, there will be a lot of goods and commodities to transport, but in a slow economy, there will be less need for CPR, so they will follow along with the unfavorable economic conditions.  Not as severe as seasonality.  Naturally there are periods of high and low demand throughout the year, so CPR experiences seasonal sales and earnings fluctuations.  

Because they lost the Kansas city bid to CNR, CPR is more vulnerable to CNR - CNR has more capability to bring goods where they need to be, so clients will probably favour them.  

I don't see railways going anywhere soon.  Trucking is much more expensive for now - but there is a risk that in the near future it becomes much much cheaper.  This could disrupt CPR and potentially render them useless.  Sure this is improbable but still something to think about.

The way they treat their employees is a liability.  60 hours of work in 7 days is rough for anyone, and the lack of work life balance is a sure way to keep the employees miserable.  If the employees decide to strike or demand less hours and higher pay, the business could be severely disrupted.

These segments are very well diversified.  I would be here for weeks talking about the different business sediments here so instead I added links and sublinks to the breakdowns of categories and subcategories.

Two percent of their revenue comes from non-freight.  This is related to fees for their tracks, leases, and random arrangements.

## Industry position

Relative analysis. Ratios, competitors, market share

By track length, CPR is the sixth largest north american railway.  They are also the sixth largest railroad by revenue in north america. 

Of the 10B+ market cap railroads, CPR is the fifth largest and they have the lowest PE out of all of them.  They have a yield of .79 which is lower than average.  Their PS, Profit margins and PB are very competitive. On the surface they look relatively undervalued - I will go deeper into their financial to see if they are intrinsically undervalued.  

## Company base statistics

Market Cap: 51 B

Total Debt: 6B

Cash &amp; Liquid assets: 219M

Goodwill:336M

Total Assets: 23B

Equity:7.3B

Revenue:7.6B

Earnings:2.6B

Operating Cash Flow:2.8B

Enterprise Value:61B

Shares Outstanding:680M

EV/Sales:8x

ROE: 35.5% (Not much of this makes it to equity)

## Overview/Growth and Developments

Growth:  

* Revenue has stayed relatively stable.  It fluctuates over 5 year time frames, probably following macroeconomic trends.  
* Earnings have had some pretty good growth.

Margins/ratios: 

* Profit margin is growing with earnings.  
* Past 7 years have had +20% margins every year

Net reinvestment:

* They don't have great credit ratings - average BBB+
* They don't have any paper R&amp;D, but they have claimed that they are working on some pretty interesting tech to reduce locomotive emissions and hopefully operational costs

Share buybacks:

* \# of shares is constantly going down.  They are adding great shareholder value over time from this.

Costs:

* Costs and expenses are low.  This gives them a lot of opportunity to invest back into the company - which it doesn't seem like they are doing even with a 30%+ profit margin

Debts: 

* Their debt is not sustainable based on traditional debt structure analysis, but their earnings easily cover it.  
* They seem to have recently been issuing less debt
* They are issuing debt with very high interest, which is reckless.  The bond market is looking for good yield but there is no need to commit over 6 percent - CPR is committing over 9% interest rate on some 30 year issues.  Why would they do that??  Maybe because the CFO did not brush his teeth so people don't want to hear him explain why he is acting recklessly
* They are adequately covered for repayments in the next five years.  2021 is the worst year with 1.178B due - but it is not very concerning.

Assets:

* Most assets are in equipment (Trains) and property (Tracks)
* They have a tiny cash reserve.  Tiny.  If it wasn't for their split and consistent cash flow generated from operations this would take down the company very fast.  They really need to build this up instead of issuing 30 years of debt at 9%+

Legal: Nothing worth noting

Recent/expected developments: 

* There was a recent oil spill that CPR had something to do with.  A small 32 000 Litres.  There is a possibility that this gets way blown out of proportion and their stock loses, but unlikely.

## Catalysts/Entry points

* An employee revolt would be good for non-owners. We would get a chance to buy when the market outlook is low
* A large environmental disaster would probably obliterate the stock price for a few days presenting a good time to buy in.
* It is possible but unlikely that they will get acquired.  They have good operations but some obvious problems. An acquisition would fix this.

## Valuation

Their market value is probably pretty close to their intrinsic value.  I was hesitant with a DCF, but came up with a little bit under the market value.  Their margin of safety can be assumed to be nil.

## Valuation Market Comparison

All of the railroads seem to be sitting between a little bit undervalued and decently overvalued.  CPR is fitting in nicely here.

## Opinion

If you have it already - fine, it could be a solid hold for now.  There is some good cash generation here that seems to be lost before it becomes cash.  But c’mon.  Were retail investors.  This company will not make us rich, and might even make us poor.  There are better places for us to put our money.  I would give this a “Warning: you will probably lose money with $CP” sticker and a weak sell rating.

## Notes and sources

Notes:

Note 1. I am not a financial advisor.  This is my opinion not my recommendation.  Do your own research.

Note 2: I do not hold $CP in my portfolio and I will not profit in the event that their shares gain or lose value.

CryptoCurrency,I don't care about the current prices no more,"Because it's finally all staked!!

Well for ETH I'd sometimes wish for cheaper prices you know, to accumulate more. 

I staked with Kraken.
As tempting as higher interest rates through de-fi might be, staking is the safest bet for me.

Sure you can't trade your ETH at the moment but as I tried looking deeper into the crypto world I realized I don't wanna get into swapping, de-fi, playing games like Decentraland. ATM it feels like too much to soak up. 

I really appreciate the sub for constant encouragement to do more then just buy crypto with fiat and leaving it in the portfolio as is, so this move right here is stage 2 for me. 

And I really appreciate the people I came across who made the same mistakes I made all together by buying high selling low and laughing about it. 

Furthermore I made mistakes by buying into pumping coins without doing research beforehand. 

So now I'm mostly ETH as this will be the infrastructure for amazing things to come. Finally feels like real investing you know. 

And I also made crypto buddies to chat with and discuss news and share experiences! That is helpful!! 
Plus no one in my direct environment is into crypto so this sub is a huge bonus!

Even if the prices skyrocketed in April/May I came to realize that this was the first time ever! I'm so excited for what's next.

solar,Am I way overthinking this?,"I have various bids from 3 vendors, but it'd kind of confusing trying to compare their different financing options and system.  So being a big nerd, I wrote a program that outputs (what I think) the payments and system usage over 25 years.  
My program goes to the NREL website and used my houses Lat/Long (SW Utah), azimuth (156) and roof pitch (19) to get the power generation for each system.  My power co-op has a service fee of $25 and charges $0.05 kWh (which is crazy cheap, but is going to go up rapidly) and 1:1 net metering (for now).  
I'm assuming a 3% power rate increase and 3% inflation rate for this batch of comps.  

 * Vendor A - Silfab Panels 330W x 32 with Enphase micro-inverters.
 * Vendor B - Jinko Panels 375W x 31 with Enphase micro-inverters.
 * Vencor C - SunPower 335 x 32 with SunPower micro-inverters.
 
https://home.wood.us/s/kfEJemfme7iiT3W

I have a baseline (No Solar) spreadsheet that shows what would happen if I didn't do anything.
Then for each Vendor I output a sheet for each of their financing options.  The sheets have:

  * Month - Month and year
  * LoanBalance
  * LoanPaymentDue - Changes if the fed and state incentives are paid for some loans.
  * LoanPaymentPaid	- I have it so I can overpay and pay down the loans faster, but didn't use that this round.
  * LoanPaymentInterest - How much of the payment goes to interest.
  * PowerUsageKwh - My household power usage based off of 2020 values. 
  * SolarWattsGenerated - NREL API provided.
  * ClippedWatts - NREL data with inverter max output - NREL without inverter max output.
  * GridUsageKwh - Extra usage pulled from the grid.
  * PowerCreditKwh - Power Credit change that month.
  * PowerCreditBalanceKwh - Power Credit balance.  Resets to 0 every Jan 1st.
  * WastedPowerCreditKwh - Power Credits that were thrown away at the end of the year.
  * ServiceFee - $25.
  * ServiceChargeRate - Per kWh charge rate from utility.
  * PowerBill - Estimated Power Bill that month.
  * MonthlyCashSpend - PowerBill + LoanPaymentPaid.
  * TotalCashSpend - Running total of all money spend on Power and/or loans.
  * LoanBalanceIav - An attempt at converting the Loan Balance back to 2021 dollars using 3% inflation.
  * LoanPaymentIav - An attempt at converting the Loan Payment back to 2021 dollars using 3% inflation.
  * MonthlyCashSpendIav - An attempt at converting the Monthly Cash Spend back to 2021 dollars using 3% inflation.
  * TotalCashSpendIav - An attempt at converting the Total Cash Spend back to 2021 dollars using 3% inflation.
  
I also have an 25YearAggregateData sheet that shows:

  * Name - Vendor name, Financing option, system

  * LoanAmount 
  * TotalPanelGeneratedKwh - Estimated how much that panels with generate.
  * TotalClippedKwh - Sum of all the clipped wattage.
  * TotalGridUsageKwh - Sum of all the grid usage.
  * TotalCreditsKwh	- Sum of all the credits.
  * TotalWastedCreditsKwh - Sum of all the wasted credits at the end of the year.
  * TotalPowerBillPaid - Sum of power bills.
  * MaxMonthlyCashSpend - The max value spent in any month, including down payments or full cash purchase.
  * NextMaxMonthlyCashSpend - The next max value, to get a better idea of what could be the max amount excluding a down payment or cash purchase.
  * AverageMonthlyCashSpend	- Average of the monthly cash spend.
  * AverageMonthlyCashSpendDuringLoan - While the loan has a balance what's the average amount spent. 
  * AverageMonthlyCashSpendAfterLoan - What does that drop to once the loan is over.
  * TotalCashSpend - Should be all out of pocket expenses.
  * TotalCashSpendIav - Hopefully it's the total adjusted back to 2021 dollars.

personalfinance,"Recovering gambling addict, looking for some advice on how to manage funds and monthly payment","Hi everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

Like the title suggests, I'm 24 years old, and a recovering gambling addict. I've gambled every last penny away and am now on the road to recovery, and trying to make a better life for myself. Some information about me: 24 years old, have a bachelors of science degree in IT, still living at home (for free).

Current monthly expenses:

Car + warranty - $470 (I know, bought too much car)

Geico insurance - $95 a month 

Gym - $40 a month

Spotify - $10 a month

I am employed by the federal government and just receive a $10,000 promotion, so I will now be making $50,000 a year. I estimate my monthly take home after deductions and taxes will be $2500 a month. 

I'd like to move out and buy my own place as soon as possible. I currently don't have much of any savings. I'd like some advice on what I should try to keep my monthly expenses to (outside of the car stuff) to save and stay on track. Plus, any advice you have for someone like me would be great too. I am really working on fixing my life and breaking the terrible habit and addiction I developed. Hoping for better days ahead :)",finance

solar,Solar panels on home and detached garage. Sub panel feed.,"Journeyman Electrician here from Canada, I've done solar training, and have done a few off grid and on grid hookups, and have done plenty of coordinating with solar companies on homes where solar has been getting installed during construction. But this is the first time that I've run into this particular situation, and I just wanted to double check my thinking.

House that we did the wiring on a few years ago has new owners, they are getting solar installed on both the house, and the rear detached garage. We've been called to upgrade the garage electrical service to a sub panel, because all we have out their currently is a 15A 240V multi-wire branch circuit. We always oversize our conduit to make sure that we can upgrade the service just in case, so we install conduit large enough for 60A, despite only pulling wire for 15A (builder/customers choice on what goes in).

New owners are getting 8x 450w panels installed on the garage, and 7x 450w panels installed on the house. House service is 100A main breaker with a 125A bus. Upgrading the service to 200A is not going to happen as this is 1 unit of 5 unit row home, so don't even suggest it. There is a single service coming into a 5-gang meter bank with 100A out to each unit. 

I just wanted to confirm whether my usual 60A sub panel in the garage would be acceptable, or if I needed to do a full 100A panel. Either way, the bus rating of the panel would be 125A. So from the house it would be fed with 60A, solar feed to the sub would be 15A at 240v, for a total of 75A on the 125A bus.

Solar would then feed back to the house on the 60A breaker in the main panel, locating at the very bottom of the panel, plus the additional solar backfeed from the house panel, located at the other lowest breaker position in the panel.

I don't see a problem with only having a 60A feed to the panel, as there is no way to potentially overload the 125A garage panel bus. But I'd like to hear some thoughts. 

If we HAVE to do a 100A sub panel feed, the owner is fine with the extra cost, but if we can still just do the 60A sub panel feed and use the existing conduit without having to re-trench, that would obviously be preferable.",energy

I stumbled across this guy named Mark Galasiewski, I saw a video of his from June 2020 and I can't believe all the stuff coming true looking at it now. He says that if you stop looking at the stock market in a rational way, everything will make sense. You have to look at it non rationally. Like for example he said markets did not crash due to Covid pandemic but instead pandemics happens at the end of the bear market(although usa was not in bear market at the time), same with oil prices and other stuff. He also said that the market did not recover due to the Fed's interference but inspite of it.In the long term, it does not matter what individual countries and their governments do, the stock markets will keep going as per the chart patterns of the Elliot Wave. It was quite fascinating to watch. I will leave a link here.Please do watch it before you comment.

stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Tuesday, July 6, 2021. Please enjoy!","**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, July 6, 2021**

Stocks traded mixed today, with the Nasdaq (QQQ) reaching a fresh intraday high, driven higher by continued strength in mega-cap tech stocks. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) opened at a new all-time high but was unable to hold onto the gains throughout the day and finished modestly lower while the Dow Jones (DIA) fell roughly 0.6%. Each of the major indexes had jumped to fresh record closing highs on Friday, propelled by the June jobs report that showed a healthy pace of recovery in the labor market but that did not suggest an overheating economy. 

Last week,  the US Department of Labor released the Job June report, which showed a stronger-than-expected acceleration in hiring, with non-farm payrolls rising by 850,000, the sixth straight month of gains. The unemployment rate however, ticked slightly higher to 5.9%. Here are the numbers

* **Change in non-farm payrolls:** 850,000 vs. 720,000 expected and an upwardly revised 583,000 in May
* **Unemployment rate:** 5.9% vs. 5.6% expected and 5.8% in May 
* **Average hourly earnings, month-over-month:** 0.3% vs. 0.3% expected and a downwardly revised 0.4% in May
* **Average hourly earnings, year-over-year:** 3.6% vs. 3.6% expected and a downwardly revised 1.9% in May

Oil prices turned lower after recently climbing to a multi-year high amid a breakdown in discussion between the two largest members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), with Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates in a gridlock over production cuts. The meeting, whose purpose was to increase output given an increase in demand for energy, yielded no decision. In response, Saudi Arabia raised the August official selling prices of all crude oil it sells to Asia, according to the state’s oil producer Aramco. 

Goldman Sachs analyst Damien Courvalin said, “As negotiations continue, we estimate that most outcomes still implies higher prices in the coming months as the physical market tightens and with higher OPEC production that the group discussed needed by the global oil market next year. Price volatility will likely rise.”

Looking ahead, market participants are waiting for the release of the Federal Open Market Committee's June meeting minutes (basically notes of what was discussed), which will help reveal central bankers' thoughts around adjusting monetary policy as the economic recovery matures. The June meeting had marked a notable shift in the Fed's outlook, with the central bank signaling as many as two rate hikes by 2023. Subsequent public remarks revealed a number of committee members were also warming to the idea of a sooner-rather-than-later move to taper the Fed's crisis-era asset purchase program. In my opinion, it is extremely unlikely that the Fed will signal any acceleration in the timeline regarding interest rates but will not be surprised if more members discussed tapering quantitative easing in the coming months. 

Next week, earnings season for the Q2 kicks off, with big banks scheduled to report first. Earnings are expected to continue being super-charged by stronger than expected demand from savings-laden consumers that are finally emerging from lockdown  thanks to effective distribution of the coronavirus vaccine. So far, analysts are looking for S&amp;P 500 earnings to grow by 61.9% year-on-year in aggregate, according to FactSet data – an estimate UBS's Head of Equity Derivatives Research Stuart Kaiser said may still be ""need to be revised higher."" This would mark the fastest pace of earnings growth since Q4 of 2009. 

**Highlights**

* Pentagon officials announced they terminated Microsoft’s massive $10 billion Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure (JEDI) cloud-computing contract and said they would start fresh with a new project, putting an end to a yearslong initiative that was unpopular in Congress and mired in litigation from Amazon (AMZN). In terminating the contract, officials said they focused largely on technical reasons, saying advances in cloud-computing in recent years have made JEDI obsolete. AMZN stock rocketed up roughly 5% on the news. 
* Grubhub announced it plans to roll out food-delivering robots across US college campuses starting this fall. Seen a lot of reports about the growing influence of automation in deliveries. Recently, Dominos Pizza also announced it was rolling out an automated delivery robot. 
* Lots of news surrounding Chinese ride-hailing giant Didi. Last week, the company went public on Thursday, however, over the weekend the Chinese government, in another crackdown of a large tech company, ordered Didi removed from app stores, citing cybersecurity complaints. Now there are reports coming out that Didi pressed ahead with the IPO despite the CCP suggesting the company delay due to “security concerns”. Shares were down roughly 19%. 
* The Chairman of Weibo, which is basically like the Twitter of China, and a state investor are reportedly in talks to take the company private in a deal worth $20 billion and help facilitate the exit of major shareholder Alibaba (BABA). A lot of news coming out of China regarding big technology companies. 
* Ford Motor (F), which has probably been hurt the worst by the recent chip-shortage, said it only has 162,100 trucks and cars in dealer inventories, half what it was three months ago and roughly one-quarter the stock the company usually has. 
* **Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices\*\***

personalfinance,"Bank is holding paycheck (NC, USA)","Edit July 7: See bottom of post for the explanation

I am helping a teacher who does not want to post on Reddit herself

I wasn't sure if she should be seeking legal advice, but I figure this would be the best place to start.

She received a paper paycheck from her employer (school). The check comes from ""STATE TREASURER Raleigh, NC"". The check also says ""Payable at par through the Federal Reserve System. On June 30th, around 4:30pm, she deposited the check electronically to Wells Fargo, as she's done in the past with other paper checks.

The next day, she saw that her funds were not available. She contacted WF and was told it was on hold due to unusual activity from the bank the check was coming from. Today, July 6th, she received a physical letter stating the same. Payroll at her school says the check has cleared on their end and the funds have been withdrawn from the Treasury. WF says the funds will be made available on July 12th.

She was able to have a three way call with WF escalation department and her payroll manager, but WF said the hold would continue.

Is WF violating Federal Regulations by holding a government check this long? IANAL but Regulation CC, Subpart B, 229.10 says that funds must be made available the business day after the banking day the check was deposited.

Other details that may help, from what I have been reading online:

\- Her WF account is over 5 years old

\- This is not a new employer (they just sent paper checks for the first payday of summer school)

\- June 30th was the end of the fiscal year for the school

I'll be monitoring this so I can reply to any comments in a timely manner.

Thanks in advance for any guidance

July 7:

Everyone she talked to yesterday would only say ""unusual deposit account activity"" as the reason. She drove to a branch and asked if they could use Regulation CC to expedite the ""investigation in the matter"" or to release the hold. A manager talked to her and showed her that the school district printed checks in a lower-than-usual quality. This, combined with the loss of quality in the image from the electronic upload, gave a very poor image uploaded to WF. Some of the words/numbers are not legible, and this led to the hold on the check. This happened to all teachers who deposited their checks to WF, and a second bank that I no longer recall. Teachers who used local banks and credit unions did not run into this issue, probably because the bank staff was familiar with the school",finance

personalfinance,Student Loan Prioritization,"Hello, 

I've enjoyed reading the advice on this board and would love to get outside takes on my financial situation.

Here's the situation: 34k in student debt

Private: 20,600 at 3.6%
Federal: 13,400 at rates ranging from 3.4-6.8%

Age: 30

I currently have 7k in excess savings beyond a 3 month emergency fund to use on the loans and anticipate having enough by October to knock out at least all but the lowest interest federal loan. My original plan was to wait until the pandemic forbearance period was over and start knocking them out but with even the slimmest possibility of forgiveness I'm questioning if that's the right direction and re-evaluating my financial priorities.  It would feel great to get rid of the federal payments (amounts 400/month) but should I be more focused on the private loans? Or is there something else I could do to maximize value? It's been a long road with these loans and I'm finally starting to see a glimmer of light at the end of the tunnel so I want to make sure I'm making the right financial decisions.


Thanks in advance for the help!",finance
personalfinance,Pay down public student loans at higher interest rates or private student loan at lower interest rate ?,"My public student loans are closer to 4% I believe average interest rate whereas I have some private loans I could pay off completely at around 3% or so. 

Would it be better to pay down the public loan because it's a higher interest rate or the private loan because it has no public protections?

I have apple shares but I bought a bunch of puts in the near term because I think this run may subside a little before earnings or more talk of their apple event. We also have some hawkish news from the feds minutes in June. Shouldn’t be anything new, but it does say that more policy makers are now seeing an interest rate increase in 2022 vs 2023. That means it’s very possible that if things get even crazier for inflation or interest rates, they could push that even closer. Will the news this week affect apples stock price? Is apples price justified right now or should they be somewhere closer to low 130s? I’m bad with technical on this one, so some insight would be great to know short term price action this week.

Trading,What is better more effective? Day Trading? Swing Trading? Long term? What is the strategy? Tips?,"Hello   everyone, since I have come on Reddit late January I have been asked   this many times, almost daily. I have told people eventually when I have   more time I will write a post on it. There was no debate this is   probably the most asked question that I have….Well why do you day trade?   Well 50 cents isn’t good enough for me? You trade for 5 to 10 cents?   That makes no sense.

**I   was going to write this post it was just when, not if. Please remember  I  am not a journalist, I am not compensated to write these, so when I   spend hours writing a post and pour insight from a real trader that is   on the battlefield everyday since 1995 it does mean much more then an   author or even most money managers. I am on the war path watching the   movement all day. Now, if I ever publish a book in my mid 50s this will   probably go into it, because this isn’t even full details but will at   least get the message across and ideas of what Long, Swing, Day Trade.   The first few paragraphs were what forced me to trade sooner, and how I   started you can skip that if you want.**

I   am going to go back to how I started in 1995 and It matters because it   is why, I started as a swing trader that held positions from 1-6  months  or even a year… It slowly evolved and I pretty much try to  liquidate my  account to have other opportunities the next trading day.

I   am not exactly sure if I started in 1994 or 1995, it was probably the   end of 1994. I was 14 or 15, I was always crazy about cars, and could   not wait to buy a used car, even if it was a beat up Oldsmobile. My   Uncle lived in Long Island in a very fancy estate and did not work at   all. He was in his late 30’s and always spent time with my brother and   I. I remember saying Uncle Andrew, you do so well, when I am 16 or 17 if   I can save up to buy a car that would be a dream. He told me he would   give me something even more valuable then money to buy the car.   Naturally, I was piqued, I knew nothing about the stock market but here I   am with $2,000 and my Uncle tells me there are ways I can definitely  by  the time I am 17, not only have a car but not some cheap Oldsmobile.  He  put me in touch with a broker he knew from JB Oxford. He told me to   read the Wall Street Journal everyday and would quiz me on articles. I   opened an account with JB with the $2,000 and at that time trades were   $50, they did allow the first 5 trades free because of his  relationship  with my uncle. I started to read and my uncle told me his  preference for  long term, and his strategy. My first investments were  things he and I  both agreed upon. Coke KO, Disney DIS, Philip Morris  MO, American Power  APC which got bought by Cisco eventually. So I put  $500 in each of these  4 and let them grow. I would watch everyday in  the journal and find the  tickers, AOL didn’t get big until 1996. It was  his guidance that caused  me to hold them long. Eventually after close  to a year the account was  almost doubled at near $4,000.

Now   by the time I was 16, AOL was booming and I got internet access right   away. My uncle was old school and read the paper everyday. Eventually I   could get quotes immediately online, and get information much quicker.  I  started to realize that if I time these things and could get quotes   throughout the day I could make that money faster and even more. I was   going off of end of day quotes. And I would call Anthony my broker from   JB Oxford the next day and place a limit order….once a year. As I  called  him more and more because I was getting mid day quotes, he took  to a  liking of me. He invited me to the city and to meet with other  brokers. I  started to see the platforms, the super computers, I met  market makers,  important people. Some of which invited me daily. I  started to write  important stuff, keep a journal on AOL. By the time, I  was 17 I was a  swing trader, I could name the Dow 30, and pretty much  the entire SP500.  I could tell you roughly the closing prices on them  all. (I cant even  do that now). I was labeled the chosen one…”Ultimate”  by market makers….  In 1997/1998 JB was about to be bought out  eventually I believe it  happened in 2000, but I say that because I  opened an Etrade account, in  case, as Anthony warned me. Etrade was  charging $29.95 per trade and  could be done online. **ONLINE TRADES?? AND JUST $30!!!**   Yea you cant imagine how funny that sounds now. The purpose of this   paragraph is that when online trading came and just at $30 per trade. I   moved from most of my positions being held for 1-3 months to 1 month.   Remember I started at like 6 months to a year, to trading and hanging   out with brokers and holding 1-3 months to just 1 month. With the   evolution of information and discounted trading I traded more and more. I   don’t know exactly the year, but I called TD Ameritrade which started   to grow at the time. Etrade came down to $19.95 per trade. Ameritrade   told me if I could do at least 30 trades a month they will discount me   to $14.95……Boom, JB was bought out…I now had an account with etrade and   ameritrade. I was enticed to trade more actively with discounted  trades.  Eventually I called etrade and told them I would like to close  the  account my $14.95 per trade at Ameritrade was awesome. Etrade  fought for  more hard. They said if I made 150 trades a quarter they  would retro  back to the trades in the quarter and make it $9.95 per  trade.  Ameritrade said If I could do 150 trades they would match the  $9.95 per  trade and give me 10 free trades! It was a crazy back and  forth the  whole time I didn’t close either account and I was forced to  make crazy  trades for these discounts. I was forced to be a day trader,  but I  started to get a great skill set. At 1 point etrade almost  demanded I  close the Ameritrade and said they were creating a new  division called  Platinum/Power Etrade and if I keep my 150 trades a  quarter they are  paying for DSL (High Speed Internet) WOW! You are all  so spoiled, you  have no idea how bad 56K dial up is. And around the  year 2001/2002 when I  had DSL (which is now extinct) It was like 300MB  download so 6x 56K  phone dial up, but no one had it. No one, if you had  DSL it had to be  like some big bank or someone really important. It  was like $400 a month  remember this was 2001/2002. So I was pretty much  forced to be day  trading but I developed a good skill set. They both  told me trading less  I would lose the discounts…..Etrade said I would  pay a discounted rate  of $200 per month for DSL if I didn’t make enough  trades.

By  around 2005/2006 I am  not sure how, but other brokers started to catch  wind of me being an  active day trader. Still don’t know how but at that  time there wasn’t  nearly as many traders, trades. Fidelity called me and  didn’t want to  take no for an answer. They offered me $7 per trade if I  could make 100  trades a quarter. So here I was with 3 different  accounts (Opened for  commission discounts, freebies), because  commissions could eat into  cost. So I had the 3 accounts Etrade,  Ameritrade, Fidelity.

Around  this  time, I was about 25 and decided to open an IRA with Chase,  because I  had no 401K of course. So that is how I have the Chase  account. I  started IRA’s at 25.

The  above  paragraphs are to describe the evolution and I guess forced hand  at  being a day trader in order to receive discounts. I kid you not  that  there were probably quarters where I did 1,000 trades. They all  worked  by quarters, not months. Eventually I got a cable modem, and  trading was  discounted and I was not required to trade as much.

**Now   this is for more, because I have so many years experience. This may  not  work for you, or your comfort level. I compiled watch lists of over  800  tickers, I have studied their patterns, read their finances. I say  this  because it may be easy for me to take a stock and trade it for  10, 50  or 75 cents.**

There  is  always a trade for me, if I want it. I have lists which I said you   should make in my posts about daily routine. So that I don’t have to   search for symbols. I simply click a situation and I have the symbols   right there and I can trade. Defensive, Power Plays (High Pe, NO PE,   Hyper Growth), Dividends, Finance, Insurance, Dow, Top SP, you get the   picture. Why this is important is I don’t have to scour and search   everywhere for a play or news. I can click a list and see anything   abnormal so there is always a trade for me, if I want it.

**Some   bloody days, it is better to sit on the sidelines and do nothing. On a   typical day I may do 2-4 rounds (BUY/SELL) On a bad day I do 0 of  course**

**I   do not set stop losses. My stocks have fundamentals, if you trade   garbage you get garbage and you may lose. I keep NIO, LMND, SNOW on   lists so I can laugh.**

**I   haven’t shorted since 2014 (TSLA), I haven’t bought options since 2017   (Puts on TSLA). I learned the had way shorting you cant go against a   cult stock or freight train. Options I learned it’s a gamble you win or   go home. Though I was very successful earlier, but I lost 50k on the   short and 25K on TSLA puts. We must learn from our mistakes.**

Now a couple of reasons why day trading is better

You   keep cash ready for an opportunity the next day. Yesterdays crazy  drop,  and rally. Unfortunately, my portfolio was about 66% stocks, and  33% LL  which I don’t like to do so I have opportunity. I generally like  to  have at least 50-66% of cash ready. Unfortunately, I do not take  losses,  and my day trades turn into swing trades. Generally they never  last  more then 5 to 10 business days. My longest recently was 7-8 on  Allstate  which I sold at 106…. Now it is 112 on a defensive market.

Those   25-50 cents add up quickly. I made an example in 1 of my posts usig   RKT. I started trading RKT about 19-20. The market hates RKT and even   after awesome earnings it comes down. Also, now everything is commission   free!!! I literally have gotten about $20 on RKT, that is how much I   have scooped with that 25 to as much as a dollar. **There are plenty of very successful day traders that pick 5 to 10 stocks and trade them for a living!** As a kid, I saw market makers that would focus on 2-3 all day the same ones for a month.

On   VRM I probably made about the same with 50 cents to 2 dollars. Knowing   and studying the patterns is critical if you want to be a day trader.   Before VRM took off. I carefully studied the pattern from 33-38 over a   60 day period and once it blasted thru 38 I did not trade it until this   past Thursday. Yes, of course stocks can blow by comfortable trading   levels and we must pivot and do something else\*\*. HELLO 800 TICKERS!\*\*

If   you do not plan on viewing stocks daily, or weekly I actually  recommend  Index funds like the RUSSELL 2000, the SP500, the Nasdaq  100….. Do not  buy mutual funds (heavy fees) and I do not recommend  ETF’s way riskier  and higher fees than index funds. Look at the  superstar Cathie that’s  now down over 20%. I look at her portfolio and  laugh. So no ETFS! Do not  be a stock picker if you don’t plan to  reevaluate at least every  quarter on an earnings report. Things can  change on a dime. Did you see  VRM!!!!

**Yes   there are Apples, Netflix, Amazon, Invisalign (All which I did own),   but remember there are close to 10,000 stocks that trade so what is the   probability you own the next best thing since sliced bread?**

**Trading   a lot is about probability, risk on the upside, the downside. Market   sentiment, as we see interest rates etc. You must monitor or I suggest   the index funds.**

**If   you plan to be a great trader it takes a ton of patience, reading,   experience and seeing the market. Do not believe you can quit your job   and be a day trader for life unless you are willing to do that? Did you   read my daily routine? I follow that to this day!! Will you? If you do   not or 1 day decide to wake up late you can see red crayons for a  while.  The other day a reddit user whom I like and he messages me daily  went  on the hype train with RKT, though it was against my advice. He  had a  chance to get out and be slightly profitable the next morning.  Instead  he partied and drank the night before and now RKT is 24……….Do  you know  what a mistake that was? And from what he says he has 3,000  shares…. Do  you see how costly that error was. I am not naming names  but he knows if  he reads this who he is. And I am not saying this to  make him feel bad.  I am saying this because to be successful this is  not a game, it may  seem like it until red crayons and you need the  money.**

**Lastly,   do not believe I will continue to do this with no compensation  forever.  Do not think you all can sleep wake up, get great plays, make  money and  the next day just rinse and repeat. I will stay on Reddit and  will not  close the forum/group. My posts will remain as great insights  from a  trader. I do not know what I plan to do yet. My 60 day  experiment will  end March 31st. What I can say, is that I will  absolutely not spend 2-3  hours a day on reddit with no compensation. I  am happy if everyone  around me learns and makes money. But I also want  to land that 500K job,  yup it’s a long shot but I was giving the  experiment 60 days. And yes,  Wall Street Journal did reach out to  me…..but once I said I wanted 500k…  everyone got quiet. Listen, I have  to make more than Im making now. I  have to be able to retire from my  W2, maybe stop doing computers for  this to be worthwhile.**

**So   3 hours later, yup took me 3 hours to write this, I hope it helps. And   remember I am not a journalist with an opinion, I am not an author   writing in past tense with old experiences on trading. I am on the front   lines with you! Battling out! Seeing the blood, rallying the troops!**

I hope you can help me out with a couple of questions. I believe that a collection agency may have reported my medical (dentist) debt to the credit bureaus prematurely and I want to file a dispute with the bureaus in the hopes it will get removed from my credit report.

I know there supposed to be a mandatory 180-day 'waiting period' before any medical debt can be reported in my credit file. However, I am not clear on what counts as a starting point of this 180-day period... Is it the original billing date? The date when the bill became past due? Or the date when it got turned over to the collection agency?

Also, is there a formal federal bill name or a legislative statute I can reference when filing my dispute with the credit bureaus? I came across a bunch of online articles that mentioned a 'new law' that mandated 180-day waiting period for all medical debt but I could not find any specifics or the original source.",finance

personalfinance,Help with Condo Purchase Budget,"Looking to see if I'd be ok given the below:

&amp;#x200B;

* Purchase price $1.03M, Brooklyn condo
* I'd be making a down payment of 30% ($309k) so borrowing 70% ($721k)
* My monthly expense, according to the streeteasy calculator on the unit (mortgage + common charges + tax), is $4,086
* Sponsor is paying full transfer tax, mansion tax, sponsor attorney fee, and even 1-year worth of common charges. I'm also getting 2.5% rate and $7,000 closing cost assistance from mortgage lender
* I’m estimating maybe about $4,200-4,300 monthly after including utilities and insurance
* My yearly salary is $150,000. So my *gross* monthly income is $12,500
   * From looking at my paycheck online:
      * Here's how my deductions break down:

|Deduction|Amount|
|:-|:-|
|401k: (This is front-loaded so that I'm paying more upfront until I hit the max allowable contribution and then it's automatically cut off for me. This happens right around November yearly)|$2,000.00|
|Dent Base:|$8.14|
|HSA Individual:|$300.00|
|Pretax Commuter:|$0.02|
|Vision:|$0.98|
|Vol Accident:|$9.08|
|TOTAL|$2,318.22 (until around November due to frontloading of 401k)|

&amp;#x200B;

* I'm taxed nearly $4k per month, here's how it breaks down for the month:

|Tax|Amount|
|:-|:-|
|Federal Income Tax:|$1,868.56|
|Employee Medicare:|$176.76|
|Social Security Employee Tax:|$755.82|
|NY State Income Tax:|$581.04|
|New York R:|$389.24|
|NY Paid Family Leave Employee:|$63.86|
|NY Disability Employee:|$2.60|
|TOTAL|$3,837.88|

&amp;#x200B;

* So all the above totals out to about $6,156.10 per month that's gone from my monthly paycheck (and then goes down a bit in November due to hitting 401k max by that point)
* Which leaves maybe about $6,000 *net* income per month (just rounding to make it simple)
* A big thing here is that my parents will be gifting me $30k yearly starting next year for as long as they’re able to do so, maybe 10 years. That's definitely happening, they are happy to give it.
* This breaks down to an additional $2,500 per month
* So my *net* income becomes $6,000 (net income from my salary) + $2,500 (parents' gift per month) = $8,500

My current situation is that I'm paying $1500 in rent plus utilities so let's say $1700. $6,000 (net income from salary per month) - $1,700 = $4300 left over

At the condo, I'd be paying about $4,300 (including utilities and insurance). $6,000 (net income from salary per month) - $4,300 = $1,700 left over. BUT with my parents' additional $2,500 per month, that would actually be $1,700 + 2,500 = $4,200 left over

So by this calculation, with my parents' additional funds, I'd have just about the same amount left over as I do now. So if I can live on $4,200 now then there'd be no difference at the condo.

I know it's a big jump from $1500 in rent to $4k in mortgage but i was living below my means for a long long time and it's the reason I had so much to be able to put into the down payment.

Do I have this right?",finance

Previously Covered but still interesting:

1. Manuel Chakravarty gave a big update on Hydra (layer 2 scaling). Hydra will not require that the base layer be modified since it will be implemented via Plutus smart contracts. Hydra is actually a collection of protocols including Hydra Head and Hydra Tail. Hydra Head is a symmetric protocol where multiple participants will be online simultaneously for the whole period of the head exchanging messages. Hydra Tail is an asymmetric protocol involving a high performance server and many clients that may be mobile and could be offline for large portions of the tail’s existence. There will also be “inter head &amp; tail networking” which will allow for a network of heads and tails. They have a published research paper on Hydra Head. They are currently writing the Hydra Tail paper.
2. Hydra is distinguished from other layer 2 protocols by its isomorphic properties. This means you will be able to run any smart contract that works on the base layer in a Hydra Head! This is very special. We won’t need special purpose contracts built out just for layer 2. There are some big implications to this. Since a Hydra Head is essentially just a Plutus smart contract, this means you can run a Hydra Head inside another Hydra Head. It’s turtles all the way down, guys. It sounds like they can do this iteratively as much as they want.
3. Aggelos also gave a good presentation on the importance of “skin in the game” in resource based consensus protocols (both proof-of-work and proof-of-stake) and its effect on promotion or discouragement of centralization. He explained how Ouroboros has built-in safeguards to prevent centralization including the K parameter (currently at 500) which caps total rewards per pool and the alpha parameter (currently at 0.3) which splits rewards into a 77% piece and a 23% piece. A pool can take its share of the 77% piece based on the pool’s total stake and its share of the 23% piece based on the pledge of the SPO. A higher alpha parameter makes it less attractive for individual SPOs to proliferate multiple pools since they can’t be as leveraged on their available pledge and still get as big a share of the 23% piece. This also discourages Sybil Attacks. As Cardano on-chain governance progresses, these parameters will be controlled by the community.
4. There will be a Cardano Goguen Summit in September. It will be hybrid digital/in-person.

We also learned exactly how Mithril is going to work. [https://youtu.be/LhepJFCyWRk](https://youtu.be/LhepJFCyWRk)
9. In proof-of-work, bootstrapping can be done with blockheaders. This won’t do in proof-of-stake since we need information about stakeholder distribution to confirm block validity.
10. Mithril fixes this by being a cryptographic construction that enables a population of stakeholders to issue a signature consistent with certain constraints.
11. For Mithril to work in proof-of-stake, it needs three crucial properties: 1) it needs to enforce a threshold ratio of stakeholders before the signature is issued; 2) the pre-signature fragments must be independently verified and subject to public aggregation; and 3) it must be efficient in the sense that the final signature is of constant size and is logarithmically dependent on the # of stakeholders.
12. Stakeholders will issue special Mithril keys along with the normal cryptographic key material. Then at regular intervals, full nodes will test whether they can produce a pre-signature fragment. Only a random subset of stakeholders will be eligible to produce a pre-signature fragment. When a sufficient # of pre-signature fragments have been issued by eligible stakeholders then it will be possible to aggregate the fragments into a final signature.
13. This will be a checkpoint that will be verifiable with respect to previous check points all the way back to the genesis block. Such checkpoints will be cryptographic commitments of the relevant UTXOs.
14. Since the checkpoints will be trustless, a light client (i.e. wallet) will only need to verify the sequence of checkpoints up to the current time to trustlessly bootstrap.

23. Vitalik is saying it’s highly unlikely we see ETH 2.0 before late 2022. I’m guessing that means mid 2023 which will be after two years of Cardano slaughtering the entire ETH user base. Things are looking so bad that Vitalik says he doesn’t even like using the ETH 2.0 label anymore since he knows the changes will be more incremental. This is what early capitulation sounds like guys.

57. Hedgefund Billionaire Paul Tudor Jones tells the world to buy crypto and certain other assets if the Fed doesn’t address inflation in their policy meeting that concludes on Wednesday. JP Morgan’s Jamie Dimon concurs that the current inflation is very likely not transitory. This could be tremendously good timing for Cardano given our top five status and the impending mainnet launch of smart contracts.

70. Bloomberg just published a piece called “America Should Become a Nation of Renters”. While this statement is probably extremely polarizing for Americans, it can also be argued that the death of homes as the primary investment vehicle of Americans may open up a new wave of adoption in crypto as an alternative.

74. It looks like the second biggest ETH stakepool or it's custody provider has lost it’s users private keys to $75MM in ETH. Cardano doesn’t have this problem. We get to keep custody of our crypto because we found a better way than slashing.

77. The June Cardano 360 is currently available on Youtube. [https://youtu.be/al5m14299ww](https://youtu.be/al5m14299ww)
78. We saw segments on various newer partner entities like Nervos, Orion Protocol, and Revuto. Nervos is a UTXO proof-of-work blockchain which is building a cross-chain bridge with Cardano so that you can use your ADA on Nervos dApps and vice versa. Interoperability is a big theme for Nervos and they plan to have a working testnet within a month. Orion Protocol is building a terminal that will allow for decentralized non-custodial trading across centralized and decentralized exchanges. They say this would not require you to KYC or even have an account with any of these exchanges. Revuto is an online subscription management service that recently completed a $10MM token sale on Cardano.
79. It was also revealed that Wolfram Labs, COTI, and IOHK have a three-way partnership (a ménage à tech) to build an NFT auction site. The people from Wolfram were talking about very interesting things including live minting during streaming events and automated upload to IPFS. COTI will be building out auction and bidding mechanisms in ADAPay.
80. Professor Aggelos Kiayias gave us an update on research including that Ouroboros Chronos and Hydra papers have both been accepted into conferences/journals. Chronos will provide Cardano with a global concept of time that doesn’t rely on any outside timekeeper. Prof. Kiayias also pointed out that Hydra is distinguishable from other layer two protocols in that the scripting language is identical to that of the base layer in Cardano such that any dApp that can run on Cardano will run on the Hydra L2. This is a huge plus and superior to many other layer two solutions in other ecosystems where the base layer dApps will not run on layer two. Finally, the Mithril paper has been submitted for peer review. It will provide Cardano light wallets with Succinct Non-interactive Arguments of Knowledge that will give us the best of both worlds: no delays for syncing as in full node wallets while still preserving trustlessness.
81. Finally, the Goguen Summit will be in late September. Sign up now at [summit.cardano.org](http://summit.cardano.org/).
82. The Fed is once again STRONGLY signalling to us that they are going to regulate stablecoins. The Fed is also specifically calling out Tether for the first time. You need to be thinking about how stablecoin regulation might affect your favorite Cardano DeFi or other project.

83. People are starting to realize that the Stakehound private key loss in ETH may attract unwanted regulatory attention to Ethereum 2.0 while this problem could never have occurred in Cardano. Also, only a few days later another ETH stakepool (this time SharedStake...the sixth biggest ETH Stakepool) allegedly experiences a rugpull that some are valuing at over $30MM. This is another problem that could not happen in Cardano staking. It feels like we stepped into the ring, they rang the bell, and ETH just started punching itself in the head. Eventually it’s going to KO itself.

investing,Historical inflation levels - 1914-2021,"I thought this table was worth passing along as it was interesting to scan the historical inflation percentages. The 70’s and early 80’s was rocked with high levels, but other than 1991 &amp; 2008, levels have been low to moderate. Last month we hit 5% and that hadn’t happened since 1991, the fed has remaining somewhat steady in their messaging but Janet’s recent comments *could* be a indicator. (She said a little inflation is ok)

I just wonder how much higher it could go, and what exactly transitory means from this point forward. We’ve all seen constant rotations this summer and it’s been hard to get a grasp on where the market is moving. Are there higher levels of Inflation that can still warrant continued returns on growth names? Or are we entering a period of defense/value names? It’s a very interesting time.",finance

personalfinance,Dual Fellow Doctor Income &amp; Loan Questions,"Hi, I have been trying to figure out what to do with my partner and my finances since we moved from residency to fellowship this year.

1. We both each about 250K in student loans (all federal).  We were aiming to do PSLF but not sure if it is worth it since I will be making (250-300K) and he (\~200K) when we are attendings.  We are currently starting our fellowships (me 65K, him 80K) and I will finish in 3 years and he will in 4 years.  Initially we thought since we would already have 6-7 years of PSLF credited years that it would be easier to do PSLF but now reading through sites I'm realizing that we have a higher income so we could possibly pay it off once we refinance our loans when we become attendings?  Is this a correct way of thinking?
2. We both have 401k and 403b retirements account that are funded by our previous residency program.  We both each have about 16-20K in 401k and 3-5K in the 403b accounts.  Would it be worthwhile to convert these to roth IRA so we pay taxes when we are in the lower tax bracket or should I be keeping these so we can do a possible backdoor roth IRA in the future?

Should have left it financed for lower interest rate, but hindsight 20/20 and all that.

I had the idea of selling the car (which is notorious for engine trouble close to my mileage), using that money to pay off almost all of my CC / medical bills, and finance another car so I only have 1 source of debt at a lower interest rate. I also thought about leasing for 2 years max, and save up during that time to buy another car outright.

I just took a new job in the research triangle and am in the process of relocating there now. I’m really hoping to buy a place because I’m confident I’ll be here for many years, the low interest rates, and I am worried housing prices will continue to rise with Apple’s new campus coming soon. Additionally, if I rent for a year, decent places will run me $2k a month.

My problem is that I only graduated 2 years ago so I haven’t had the time to save up a large down payment. I’m looking at homes in the $400k-$500k range, and my salary can comfortably cover the mortgage payments and PMI, but I consistently hear people recommend against PMI. If I can put down $25k (5-6%) and afford PMI, is it really that poor of an idea? Alternatively, I could take out a loan against my 401k and put down 20%.

If you were in my situation, would you wait a year and risk missing out on current interest rates and prices (assuming they rise)? This time next year, I’ll have closer to $100k available for a down payment but will have spent ~$25k on rent without building equity.",finance

CryptoCurrency,"""Bitcoin Pension"": BTC ""co-founder"" Joerg Molt with a probability bordering on certainty arrested in Germany","summary:

On July 1st, the German federal police were able to prevent the escape of a ""suspected asset fraudster and his alleged accomplice"" at Frankfurt Airport, Germany. The responsible public prosecutor's office confirmed to the editors that the arrests and the investigations are in connection with the so called 'Bitcoin Pension'. This makes it indirectly clear that the suspect must be Joerg Molt, with a probability bordering on certainty.

Molt described himself as Bitcoin ""co-founder"" who allegedly owns around 250,000 BTC, and appeared for several years as a Bitcoin influencer, author and speaker - while the business model of his 'Bitcoin Pension' (a weird kind of savings plan - ""invest min. 0.1 BTC and get 2 - 5 BTC back after a certain time"") was extremely questionable from the outset. He is accused of stealing a total of 62 Bitcoin from over 50 victims.

So with current prices on everything, and assuming max spending on other, we're at $4,106 in expenses for the month. After taxes, health care deductions, 401k to get match, net income monthly for me is $3,302, and for my wife, is \~$1800 for a total of $5102. So we should be able to save $996 a month.

Most months something pops up that we have to pay for - car repair, vet visit, whatever. When that doesn't happen, we are able to save some. 

In addition to my regular job, I have been doing food delivery services as 1099, earning roughly $500 a week, I immediately put 40% of this in a savings account and make quarterly tax payments. The leftover from that, I put towards what was my highest balance student loan until it's paid off. I've done this for 2 months and have been able to pay off an extra $2.3k. I've run some calculations that show if I keep this up, I'll have student loans 1-3 paid off in 3 years rather than 7, which frees up an additional $\~785 a month. At that point I think I would stop with the food delivery apps.

So we should be able to save $996 a month - most months something pops up that we have to pay for - car repair, vet visit, whatever. When that doesn't happen, we are able to save some. 

Our car is paid off, and we have roughly $4k in savings, so 1 month emergency fund really, although if we are in a pinch I know this can be stretched by cutting a lot of what we budget for now.

So, are we ready to buy a house? I'm worried that if we wait too long we will miss our chance to get a decent home with the way the market has been. I'm also hating throwing away equity by renting, as I have been for the past 10 years. I also want to give our dogs a yard to run around in rather than being leashed all the time for walks.

 We want to buy a house max price of $200k to stay within our feasible budget for monthly expenses. If I'm willing to spend \~$1200 a month on rent I can't help but think that I'd be fine spending that or less on a mortgage. The unforeseen expenses that come with a house will get added in to the mix of other random unforeseen expenses that we pay now with our leftover $996 a month.. but will that be enough?

Should I take the $1k extra a month I've been throwing towards student loans and start building up a down payment instead? Perhaps towards building up our E-fund more to try and prepare for major house expenses? (roof or HVAC replacement etc, I've seen horror stories.)

personalfinance,"[2019 return]Denied CTC, ACTC and EIC after audit despite qualifying and providing all requested verifying documentation.","For background, my 2019 return was audited in July of 2020 due to my tax preparer (presumably) mistakingly including a student credit I am not eligible for when filing my return (yes, I know this is partly my fault for not thoroughly checking his work, but I had never had any problems with said preparer in 4 years of them handling my returns).

As a result I was requested to provide documentation to prove eligibility of every tax credit present in my initial return, and promptly collected and mailed every document that was requested in my initial correspondence letter from the IRS. Additionally I provided about 5 other documents beyond what was requested to prove my eligibility for the CTC, ACTC and EIC credits in my return.

I then heard nothing more from the IRS for nearly a year until receiving notification in June of 2021 that a determination had been reached on my audit and that they were denying me on all 3 credits with the stated reason for the denial being that I did not provide proper documentation, along with a list showing every document I ""did not present"" to show eligibility.

Thing here is that every document listed in this section is one that I did in fact include in what I mailed in. Additionally other documents that were requested in my initial audit notification were stated to have been received, and, given that all of my documentation was sent together, I'm utterly at a loss as to how they're now alleging to have received some but not others.

In addition to knowing that I'm never getting a refund I am in fact entitled to and desperately need at this time and that the IRS is basically robbing me of my own hard earned income, the letter I received also gleefully declared that I now owe them 12 hundred on top of it between the tax increase, a civil penalty and interest rates.


I'm more than a little devastated by this judgement since I have been unemployed for over year now as a result of lockdowns, am currently dealing with an issue with my unemployment claim that has caused me to have my payments stopped for over a month now, have my savings depleted and my bank account overdrawn due to having to rely on a financing service for car repairs in order to have transportation to be able to get my son to and from a specialist in another city for several medical issues, am the sole the financial provider for two children and was kind of depending on the upcoming CTC stimulus payments to help catch up on house rental fees we are currently one month behind on now, which I'm sure I'll no longer be eligible for since I was denied the CTC on my return.

Do I have any recourse whatsoever for this determination at this point?

Again I provided EVERY SINGLE BIT of documentation that was requested of me and then some. Additionally I was definitely in the income bracket for the EITC for 2019, and both of my dependents lived with me exclusively for that entire year and ALL of their financial needs were paid for/provided by me solely.

I'm losing my mind here worrying and trying to figure out how this even happened and how I'm supposed to deal with the financial fallout from it with how much I'm already struggling to get by with all the issues hitting at all once.",finance
personalfinance,23 year old Roth IRA help,"I'm a med student who got married and is lucky enough to be able to contribute to a Roth IRA through my wife's income. We are sitting on about 75k in savings and rushed all our money into a Vanguard Roth before the tax deadline. 

Unfortunately, this was basically on a whim an neither of us have extensive financial knowledge. All I know is that we both contributed our maxes into our Roth IRA for the year of 2020. We both have it all in Vanguard's Federal Money Market (VMFXX) mutual fund.

We are looking to grow our net worth as much as possible before retirement and, given our savings+full scholarship for school+future earnings, have a fairly high risk tolerance. I have done a little bit of reading on these topics but would appreciate someone who can direct me a little.

Additionally, what should we do with the rest of our savings. It's currently sitting in a bank account, gaining nothing. We have about 2k that we have invested slowly to try to learn about stocks before investing more. If you could also help with that, we would appreciate it.",finance
personalfinance,Compensation Review: A Bold Move?,"I work in a very niche area of the energy industry. My company is small in size but has been aggressively growing within the last year, taking on a lot of new hires and doubling their annual profit from the previous year. A few months ago they poached 2 new employees from our competitor. Because what we do is so niche, even these employees from our industry who were said to have experience, have had to undergo training. I suspect they were hired at much higher salaries than me, but I'm more senior in my knowledge. I have privately discussed it with some co-workers and they agree that the poached employees are likely making more. 

My annual compensation review is coming up this month and I would like ask that my salary at least match the salaries of these new hires. I'm very thorough in my work and my workload has significantly increased in the past 2 years. My boss is very nice, but he is a total 'yes' man and answers to our CEO. 

I'm not worried about getting fired or anything of that nature because we are already severely understaffed and constantly crunching for deadlines. That said, I tend to be aggressively blunt, and so I want to check that this is not an over the top request. 

TDLR: So my question is this, should I say ""I would like to be making at least as much as BIll and Jackie within the next six months."" Or should it be better to tactfully mention wage compression?",finance
stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Wednesday, July 7, 2021","**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, July 7, 2021**

Stocks finished higher again, with the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Nasdaq (QQQ) once again recording fresh intraday highs thanks to continued strength in mega-cap tech stocks like Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), and Amazon (AMZN). The Dow Jones (DIA), which has been lagging the other two indexes the last six or so weeks, continued to underperform comparatively. Market participants are currently digesting the Fed’s June meeting minutes (basically notes of what was discussed) and are looking ahead to Q2 earnings season, which is set to kick off next week with big banks reporting. 

Oil prices remain under heavy pressure after recently reaching a multi-year high. In the latest meeting, the two most important members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), failed to reach a deal to increase crude oil production as energy demand rebounds. At the time of writing, Brent crude settled down $2.63 a barrel, or 3.4%, to $74.53, after hitting a session peak of $77.84, its highest since October 2018. The U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures settled down $1.79, or 2.4%, to $73.37 after touching $76.98, highest since November 2014. Some analysts have speculated that in light of the failure to reach a unilateral decision, individual oil producers may begin to act alone to increase production. Bob Yawger, Director of Energy Futures at Mizuho, said “The market is concerned that the UAE will step in and unilaterally add barrels and other members in OPEC will follow suit.” The White House said Tuesday it was closely monitoring talks by OPEC+ and was ""encouraged"" after conversations with officials in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.

For equity investors, the focus was squarely on the Federal Reserve’s June Meeting minutes, which will help market participants decipher that path forward for monetary policy and possible timelines for any adjustments. The Fed said the economic recovery “was generally seen as not having yet been met”, but said they are ready to act if inflationary pressures indeed begin to materialize. The minutes said, “Participants generally judged that, as a matter of prudent planning, it was important to be well positioned to reduce the pace of asset purchases, if appropriate, in response to unexpected economic developments, including faster-than anticipated progress toward the Committee’s goals or the emergence of risks that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals”. This is not surprising, as I have been saying for weeks now, as the pace of economic recovery improves, quantitative easing, or the purchase of government bonds in order to inject money into the economy, is always the first policy to be tapered. I am not worried about the tapering of quantitative easing and encourage everyone to read up about the 2013 Taper Tantrum, which happened when the Fed announced QE would be tapered since the economy had largely recovered from the 2008 crisis by then.

In short, the Federal Reserve is maintaining current policies in place but noted they were prepared to act if unforeseen pressures or progress to their goals emerged.Mark Haefele, Chief Investment Officer at UBS Global Wealth Management said of the minutes, “If the US economic recovery continues to accelerate to a sufficiently robust level into the summer, the Fed is expected to signal rolling back its asset purchases later this year. But the actual tapering would only take place in 2022, and we believe markets have largely priced in this expectation.” I fully agree, while I expect choppiness when the Fed makes more concrete statements about the taper timeline but do not see that derailing the current bull market. 

**Highlights**

* Lots of news surrounding Chinese ride-hailing giant Didi. Last week, the company went public on Thursday, however, over the weekend the Chinese government, in another crackdown of a large tech company, ordered Didi removed from app stores, citing cybersecurity complaints. Now there are reports coming out that Didi pressed ahead with the IPO despite the CCP suggesting the company delay due to “security concerns”. Shares are down double-digits in each of the sessions this week.
* The Labor Department's monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Summary showed U.S. job openings increased to 9.209 million in May. This followed a downwardly revised 9.193 million in April, which was brought down from the 9.286 million previously reported
* U.S. mortgage applications declined for a second straight week last week, declining to the lowest level in a year-and-a-half as home price growth and low housing inventories weighed further on purchasing activity. 
* Pentagon officials announced they terminated Microsoft’s massive $10 billion Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure (JEDI) cloud-computing contract and said they would start fresh with a new project, putting an end to a yearslong initiative that was unpopular in Congress and mired in litigation from Amazon (AMZN). In terminating the contract, officials said they focused largely on technical reasons, saying advances in cloud-computing in recent years have made JEDI obsolete.
* Yesterday, Nvidia (NVDA) unveiled the Cambridge-1, which the company claims is the most powerful supercomputer in the UK. The computer will be dedicated to studying and analyzing the healthcare industry.

personalfinance,What is the best budget method for me moving forward as I take on new expenses this year?,"I \[F23\] began a my first full-time job last year in August.

After taxes, TRS, insurance and stuff like that I take home around **$3693 monthly.**

Because I live with my parents I have a lot of savings and spend only around 20%-25% monthly of my monthly take-home salary on ***expected expenses*** meaning I spend around **$230** on monthly fixed bills like (my family's phone plan, internet for our home, &amp; streaming services) and then around **$400-$500** on personal things (Clothing, Entertainment, Dining Out, Transportation, Pet, ect). Anything that I don't spend from my expected monthly take home sits divided between my checking and savings amounting to around $33,470 gone unspent from that expected monthly salary. (I know I should probably be putting this extra money to work in investments and/or a Roth IRA but I am still very uneducated about it so I have been hesitant to start on those things- but that's an issue for another post perhaps lol).

This is not to say I don't spend way more month to month but as of right now anything ***unexpected and big gifts/splurges***...I subtract from anything extra I receive that *isn't* my expected take home income (i.e work bonuses, stimulus payments, tax return money, ect). This extra money has amounted to around $8950 since August of last year to June this year of which I've spent almost all of (As of June I've got $773.29 left of this ""extra money""). What did I spend all this money on? Well my expenses included things like spotting my sisters rent/tuition, spotting some of my parents extra/unexpected bills (like car trouble), family travel, buying a nice used car, two concert tickets, &amp; big anniversary/holiday/birthday gifts expenses.

Because I already have spent a lot towards my sister's tuition/rent this past year and because I want to help my parents out more I've talked to them about taking on part of my sisters rent for this upcoming year starting this August. It will be $300 monthly. I also will be starting payments on my student loans now that the covid forbearance is ending. I have 4 students loans that amount to $9006 with interest rates between 4.45-5.05%. Part of me wants to just pay it all off but I don't know if I could handle giving up that much money in one go even if it would avoid accruing/paying interest. So my plan is to pay $1000 a month towards my student loans starting August as well.

I'm thinking of following a modified version of the 50/30/20 method starting the beginning of August given that my new expected expenses will start then. With my my current take home salary this method would look like this:

**50% - Needs - $1846** Which would about exactly cover the part of mg my sisters rent, loan payment &amp; my own fixed bills

**20% Wants - $738** For my personal expenses which is about $200 more than I spend month to month on this category.

**30% Savings - $1108.12**

With paying my sisters rent I likely won't be doing a lot of ""spotting"" this upcoming year so if I do earn anything extra I'll probably just add it to my savings and/or create a sinking fund out of it.

I do expect my salary to go up this year and I'll also receive a stipend to run a club I'll be leading this school year but I am unsure of what those numbers look like at this time so I'm just working with what I got right now.

I probably gave a lot of extra unnecessary information but typing this out really helped clear up what was going on in my head and I appreciate any suggestions/critiques to this.

Thanks!",finance
personalfinance,Down payment savings- CD or Treasury Bonds?,"Hello personal finance elite! This is my first post on this sub, but I have browsed it in the past.

I'm looking for a safe place for my down payment savings, and I'm thinking my horizon for a purchase is about 1 to 2 years. 

I was looking at CD rates since my savings account interest rate is abysmal, and I like to know that I am not risking my value in the market (I have a couple of different places I keep my investments). The highest rate I could find was .7% for 18 months with Marcus, which seems absurdly low to keep my money locked away.

I was looking at Treasury Bonds (series I), and saw that they currently have an introductory rate of 3.4ish right now, and then it has an inflation-based recalculation every 6 months afterwards. Even with a penalty of losing the last 3 months of interest if I withdraw between 1-5 years from issuance, that seems an awful lot better than any CD yield I could get.

Am I missing some additional drawback if I go this route? It seems crazy that anyone would get a CD when a savings bond offers this much more.

personalfinance,Loans vs. Savings for School,"Hey PF. I am heading to law school next month and am looking for some advice regarding whether to use my savings to pay for expenses or take out more in loans.

I am in my early/mid 20s, have $15k in my checking account, nothing anywhere else. I own an old car and the only debt I have are my student loans from undergrad which are about $60k. All of those loans are federal, no private loans.

I am attending a pretty good school in a large metro area with relatively cheap COL. I have been given a strong scholarship, I will end up paying $18k/year in tuition expenses. I estimate that my personal costs will be ~$10k for this year (rent, utilities, food). So, all in all, I am thinking this first year of law school will cost me $30k. 

All loans I will be taking will be federal. I believe I am able to borrow up to $40k for the year, but of course there is no need for me to borrow up to that cap. During the semester if I end up needing to borrow more I will be able to do that as I will be under that federal loan ceiling.

With that being said, how much would it make sense for me to take out? How much of my savings should I feel comfortable using? I like having the safety net, but obviously minimizing debt is my main priority. The hope is I will be able to borrow less in year two, and even less for year three as I will be able to work over the summers in between.",finance

investing,Does this bond allocation “substitution” make any sense?,"I’m currently on a learning spree regarding the topic of portfolio allocation and diversification strategies. I’m a new investor (Jan ‘21) who began by blissfully picking individual stocks based on (in hindsight) not much at all. 

I’m just about finished with The Four Pillars of Investing and I have a whole stack of other books queued up. 

**My question is this** - considering the current interest rate environment and the possibility of rates finally being raised in the fairly near future, would it be a good or bad strategy to substitute an 80/20 stock to bond split with an 80/10/10 stock to REITs to Gold split? (Excluding bonds all together). 

I don’t know how to feel about bonds. I’ve learned a lot about the historical performance of bonds versus stocks in The Four Pillars of Investing and part of me thinks I absolutely have to allocate 20% at least. But then when I take into account the current interest rate environment, as well as other schools of thought, I’m getting the feeling that it doesn’t make sense right now. Maybe I should just be 100% stocks?

personalfinance,Advice - Should we pay off the house?,"New to Reddit and new to this group/community.  I have been back and forth on whether or not we are sitting on too much cash (we probably are) and need to just bite the bullet and do it or continue to invest in our brokerage and keep cash on hand for rainy days projects or just because.

My spouse and I just turned 36 and work for the same company.  Our gross income puts us in the $370k range each year depending on variable compensation (bonus and RSU values once stock awards vest etc).  We max out our 401ks and have $205k in taxable brokerage accounts in addition to $1.5M between both our 401ks and cash balance pensions.  We have about $95k in unvested RSUs and $72k in our oldest child’s 529 plan (12 y/o, we got a later start on the 529 and have been throwing $20k/year in), and we have $185k in cash.  We owe $170k on our 30-year mortgage.  We have a low interest rate so I have talked myself out of paying it off too early and been throwing $30k/year at our brokerage.  We have no other debt and largely live below our means. Now…onto why I like having a pile of cash….

I am paranoid.  There, I said it.  I like having a pile of cash I can get to at all times.  Because we employ a nanny for our 3 kids, our yearly expenses are significant — $100k roughly.  So I think it makes sense to at least keep that in a place where I can get to it if the worst happens, like one of us loses our job.  We’ve been stockpiling beyond that due to some home projects we are considering and want to just pay cash for.  Am I being too conservative here?  Should I just throw $100k at the mortgage and be done with it?  How much cash is too much cash?  Our fidelity guy told us we’ve got too much cash on the sidelines.  He is probably right, but the worrywart in me doesn’t like the idea of having less than $100k on hand at all times.  Or am I better off to just throw a huge chunk in our brokerage and let the debt on the house ride, given that market returns would likely beat our mortgage interest rate?",finance

For the past 5 years I’ve been working for a company that is small and relatively easy once I got the environment running on autopilot. Because of how small and niche the company is my skills have degraded to the point where realistically I can only expect a salary of around $50k a year at my next job, and it would probably take a couple years to regain my current range around $95k. 

The thing is, I’m about to get a huge bonus when the company sells. It will be around $300k after taxes. 

My current monthly expenses are $3,123 with very little room for reduction without paying off the car and mortgage. I can shave off about $250 a month if I cut my entertainment budget.

I carry $10k in personal debt on top of the home and car, but the interest rate is only 1%. My total debt is about $166k. 

The thing that I can’t decide is whether I should pay off my home and car so that my new monthly expenses would be $1,600, allowing me to comfortably work at any salary indefinitely, or to invest it and keep like a year on hand to cover any deficit. 

I guess this is more of an emotional decision than mathematical one since on paper I know it would be better to invest the money.

stocks,"The Nasdaq and market keep making record highs, my watch lists are a sea of red. What gives? Are we already in a correction? Thoughts?","So what does that mean, the market has turned upside down? What does that mean when the Nasdaq is hitting new highs everyday but many of the stocks I watch are down? What is this divergence? Is the Nasdaq index accurate? What stocks are actually up?

So yesterday 7/6/2021, I was surfing on Reddit and I did come across some Warren Buffet videos. The oracle of Omaha and well deserved. I have read a couple of his books maybe 10-12 years ago, read much about him but actually didn't see these videos until yesterday. In a nut shell he stated that you can not time the markets, no one can time the market, the best time to buy, is when you first see value and if anything but it in increments. The 2nd thing he stated was that he does not buy anything where he does not see value..... if it does not make money now..... because you can not predict the future, ""a bird in the hand right now, is worth 2 more in the bush."" That means if you have a solid company making money now, do not jump ship and buy/speculate on something that is losing money/growing or for the short term perceives to be doing alot better. This paragraph will become important as I answer these questions. I hope to help calm everyones' nerves with the answers to these questions.

I have wrote in many posts, as far back as a few weeks that the market is upside down, ever since the Nasdaq was at 13,800-14,000 and fed Powell was about to speak. The market upside down is when stocks that make money, have cash, give dividends, have the ability to buyback shares, raise dividends are falling like knives. Something like AFIN dipped under 8! NYCB under 11! (Again today, thanx for the trade), NYMT under 4.50 (Here we go again).. These are stocks that I constantly trade, and tell the elite team to trade when we are forced to pivot and seek safety. Why? Because they can do all of those things....... A company that does not make money, can not buy shares, can not raise dividends, and even as the stock drops they want to print more shares..

Many followers and the elite team are asking me what do I think is going on, why is the Nasdaq making new highs but I see a sea of red? So, I did alot of digging this week. The Nasdaq is indeed a cap weighted Index.. So is the SP and Nasdaq 100 are all cap weighted. That means as the market cap of a company grows (That is the overall value of a company) the meaning and weight it carries on the index grows as well....Why does this matter? The big 5, AAPL, MSFT, AMZN, GOOG, FB... account for 40% of the nasdaq!!!! Look it up! I just did, because I am supposed to be all knowing! You guys do keep me sharp! AAPL alone accounts for 12% of the nasdaq index and nearly 20% of QQQ (Nasdaq 100). The Nasdaq has almost 5,000 tickers. So the fact that 5 company's can shift 40% or more! of the market means that 4,000 can call and 150 can be up and the NASDAQ can be up! Is that possible? Yesterday there were 4 decliners for every advancer.. (4,000 down, 1,000 up) that is 7/6/2021. Today 7/7/2021 there were about 1.5 decliners for every advancer. (3,000 down and 2,000 up)..... In fact the US equity market is about 50 trillion and covers about 12-13,000 tickers amongst the NYSE, NASDAQ, AMEX and OTC... These 5 make up about 10 trillion!! So, just these 5 are 20% of the entire US market!! Yes! Now, I knew they were important and cap weighted I just didnt know how so..... because these stocks are making record all time highs, the Nasdaq is at 14,600-14,700 and its a sea of red. I started to see what was up and saw these mighty titans and some speculative stocks.. So that is your answer....... it is happening, why the Nasdaq is making new highs and I see a sea of red. So the Nasdaq is accurate, their is no mistake. Some stocks like SE, BILL are going sky high, LMND bouncing back but these are strictly speculative, snow.......

What is the danger in this? Why does it matter? Because I was even telling my elite team to me, we are already near a correction. If you take out 25 of the largest cap companies their is no doubt the Nasdaq is already down 5-10% but we cant see it! They have asked me other ways to track what is going on...... The only other way is to track other nasdaq important stocks to know, because if you track these 5 that mean the most, they are making highs. The danger in this is if they fall, it may cause a panic and speculative stocks will really crash! Because if the Nasdaq is at record highs and most people do not know its a few company's bringing up the market if the Nasdaq as a whole falls to 14,000 it may cause panic!

What do we do? I am going back defensive after I sell of some of my offensive stocks....Or I will buy an offensive stock after its down at least 5% on the day.....

Recall earlier the paragraph about Warren Buffet and buy value, cash cows, and buy more when fear is instilled elsewhere........ When the market started to turn upside down, an amazing value stock I had was TX, it dipped to 31, I did buy more, albeit in fear and traded it. It has bounced back to near 52 week highs as of today near 42. So that is a 30+ percent move in 2 weeks on a safe stock that makes cash! AFIN, BRMK, NYCB, they all recovered and made for great trades.... Today I am given another trading opportunity in NYCB and NYMT.......Now an offensive play, give it, these are Chinese are getting crushed and they are offensive. TIGR and VIPS. TIGR rose to 30!! It is now under 21...... VIPS dipped to 15 and change went back to 20.66 and has dropped this week because of DIDI (Chinese).. Same with TIGR.. I do own VIPS at 21.... I have been trading TIGR.... I just wanted you all to see what the difference is of a defensive play making tons of cash \[1 in the hand, 2 in the bush\]..... Now I do believe VIPS and TIGR are 2 offensive plays that should rise but we do have to be careful....

So in short, the market is upside down, being held by a few stocks. I refer to the Nasdaq as most of us trade tech/growth. I hope this explains much, and calms nerves for people with stocks that make cash!!!",finance
stocks,PulteGroup $PHM company analysis,"# Company Summary

PulteGroup is a residential home builder based in Atlanta and formed in 1956.  They are the fourth largest homebuilder in the US after $DHI, $LEN, and $NVR.  They have a number of different brands and are vertically integrated in the homebuilding process from purchasing undeveloped land to selling completed homes.  They develop communities with single family detached homes, townhouses, duplexes and condos.  Their target market is middle class Americans and they also develop residential communities focused on senior living in 23 different states.  45% of their customers are ‘moving up’, 31% are first time home buyers and 24% are purchasing senior living options.

When purchasing land, they claim they use well developed data models to predict socioeconomic trends for housing markets in cities and isolated communities.  The auditor seemed very optimistic about their computer models as compared to $MDC, a similar homebuilder.

They sell homes in two ways:

* Speculative homes: homes that have already been built.  PHM expects that these homes will be purchased based on their own analysis of the region
* Pre-ordered homes: homes that are customized by a committed buyer.  The buyer puts down some principal capital that is usually non-refundable and has to prove that they are adequately covered to purchase or finance the home.

They run a mortgage issuance segment that mostly issues mortgages to their homebuyers and then sells the mortgage to some other institution in order to reduce the risk on their own balance sheet.

They control 180,352 lots in total.  5000 in the NW, 15000 in the SE, 21000 in Florida, 9700 in the midwest, 16000 in texas, and 25000 in the west.  30% of lots are developed.  91, 363 of these lots are owned, and 88,989 are optioned.  43% of owned lots are developed and 16% of optioned lots are developed. See Note 2. At the bottom of the report for more info on the regions.

**Management overview:**

I’ve heard the grandson of the founder speak, and all I can say is it was a good decision keeping him out of the CEO position.  People have a good opinion of the company from what is on glassdoor.  There are a few comments about management being bureaucratic and putting unnecessary pressure on employees, but these only account for a small percentage of comments.

CEO: Ryan Marshall.  He has an accounting and business degree, but it looks like he has only ever worked for PHM.  He has over 20 years at PHM and his compensation was over 13 million dollars.  This seems way too high for a CEO of a company this size.  He has very good reviews on glassdoor (94% approval).

CFO: Bob O’Shaughnessy.  Has an accounting degree.  He has a much more diverse work experience than the CEO, but it isn’t in housing.  He spent 10 years at Ernst and Young, 14 years at Penske as the CFO, and then 10 years at PGH as CFO.  He has past CFO experience so I wouldn't be worried about him making irrational decisions.

## Addressable Market

This section is speculative, they do not provide a breakdown of their target markets so I had to do some reverse engineering to get to this conclusion.

Their main business is single family homes, which account for 85% of their revenue.  They talk vaguely about who they target, but it is quite clear to me after looking at the homes they sell that their target market is the middle class with a bit more in savings than most.  Their homes are good quality, and their senior living arrangements are standalone homes with a lot of customization and community amenities available.  From my analysis I think it is fair to state that their average buyer is in the upper middle class, and the retirees who buy homes have an average amount of savings, although there is serious interest from wealthier seniors.

## Risk

PHM is directly exposed to the volatility of the housing industry.  They are a middleman in real estate ownership and try to keep their inventory turnover below 36 months.  The way they purchase land is akin to dollar cost averaging.  They purchase land more frequently than 36 months, and their long term assets are constantly changing.  This brings us to the possibility of significant reduction in real estate value.  Sure they might lose paper value on their balance sheet but there is still a fixed selling price that they will generate significant operating cash flows from.

Thankfully, there is a very prominent event that is an example of the worst case scenario for homebuilders - [check this out](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/economy/reports/2017/04/13/430424/2008-housing-crisis/) if you don't know what I am talking about.  They took a big hit because of the dropoff of demand.  It took 6 years, or four housing cycles to build back to pre 2008 levels, and they had three years of negative earnings.  They managed to decrease debt and took the unfavorable but appropriate approach of selling 150 million shares, an increase of 60 percent.  Since then they have bought back those 150 million shares but who's to say there isn’t another housing crisis on the horizon?  I have looked closely at common and uncommon indicators and all I see is a lack of supply but there is obviously much more that I am completely blind to.

The mortgages they keep on their balance sheet are slightly worrisome, but when I think about it, if the homeowner defaults, the home will just be repossessed by PHM.  So not much of a concern.

They are vulnerable to commodity price inflation, but the distribution and acquisition of these works the same way as their land purchases do.  Non land inventory is purchased regardless of the price, and home prices tend to slightly outperform the general CPI so this doesn't really concern me as it balances out the same way as land purchases.

One unconventional risk they face is the lack of skilled laborers.  The average age of construction workers has increased by [two years in the past seven years](https://sgchorizon.com/construction-industry-workforce-getting-older).  There are more and more people going to post secondary school trying to make more money and do less work each year.  This really does pose a significant risk to PHM in the long run.  Less human capital supply means higher wages means lower margins means less operational cash generation means more debts and less cash means ultimately a more unstable and unhealthy business.  No matter what happens otherwise in the economy, I think this could be their biggest long term risk.

Their ‘in your face’ optimism in their annual report isn’t captivating me.  They also say that they think past stock price performance compared to the DOW home constructors index “represents a meaningful analysis for investors” ([Page 19](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/822416/000082241621000007/phm-20201231.htm) above the stock performance chart).  Again, this is really immature for the auditor to say this.  They have competitive financials and a good company, so there is no reason for the auditor to go so overboard when they prepare reports.  This stuff always makes me suspicious.

## Revenue Breakdown / Company segments

96% or revenue is from all homebuilding operations.  This figure is 10.7 Billion:

* 45% of their customers are not making their first purchase.  This section excludes seniors.
* 31% are first time home buyers.
* 24% are purchasing senior living options.

The remainder is from their financial services.  This figure is 0.362 Billion.

Their average annual output of homes was 24600 last year.  It has been growing slowly in the past three years at about 2% YoY.

## Industry position

Some of their competitors are $DHI, $LEN, $NVR, $TOL, $LGIH, and $KBH to list a few.  PHM has the lowest P/E and PEG, and their P/S AND P/B are average out of their competitors. Their D/E and margins are competitive, but they are lagging with their ROE/ROA/ROI.  Free cash flow is currently at about 30% of the market cap but this is not usually the case.

They have an estimated 6.1% market share in American residential construction.

## Overview/Growth and Developments

Growth: Revenue took a turn for the worse in the late 2000s, but since then it has almost returned to pre 2008 levels.  The growth has been very steady

Margins:

* Margins seem to hover between 8-13%, and there hasn't been much change over the years.  The values are the same before 2007

Net reinvestment:

* They have a BBB- Credit rating
* A lot of capital expenditures go towards land that is either held and sold or developed
* Not much R&amp;D that would benefit them.

Share buybacks:

* Share buybacks have been good since 2008.  They have shown that they are capable of taking action to add shareholder value
* Their massive issuance in 2008 also shows that they are willing to raise capital and diminish shareholder value if it is needed for the business.
* The implications are mixed here.  If I am looking from a shareholders perspective, then I would be skeptical of their excessive issuance in the past, but if I was looking at it as a long term business owner, it shows responsibility and willingness to sacrifice their reputation if it can keep their business strong.
* They have bought back almost all of the shares they issued in 2008.

Costs:

* They are consistently putting more money into paying off debts than they are taking out debt.
* One thing to consider in their operational costs is they are forced to pay market prices for commodities.  They don’t keep a lot of inventory so these costs may become harder to manage unless they raise home prices along with the CPI.  They have a 24-36 month lag behind the CPI in pricing their marketable assets because of the nature of the building contracts with their buyers.
* They had their second most successful year in 2020, and instead of massive bonuses they decided to:
   * Repay all 700M drawn on their revolving credit facility
   * Repurchase $75M in shares
   * Increase dividends by 17% (Why so much?  Invest back into the business or buy more shares)
   * Committed to an early completion of notes due 2026-7 (Done Mar ‘21)

Debts:

* They have 411M in financial services debt and 2.752B in Notes payable.
* The notes payable is adequately spread over 15 years.  The highest interest is 7.9% due 2032 and the average interest rate is 5.5%.  As long as their operations are at least half as strong, their debt won’t be a problem.  Interest expenses and retirement on these on average will cost them 180M/year
* Financial services debt is of no concern with an average interest rate of 3%.

Assets:

* Assets have grown since 2011.
* They have just under 13 B in assets
* They currently have less assets then they did in 2005-06
* Most of their assets are in PPE but they still keep 3.2 B in current assets.

WACC: 8.5%

Long term growth rate: They will grow with the housing market, but also shrink with it.  3.5-3.8% organic growth per year is reasonable.

Legal: Nothing

Recent/expected developments:

* They have 13657 homes in production currently, with 10421 of those already sold.
* No expected developments

## Industry advantages

Suppose this data driven model they talk about really can predict socioeconomic trends in neighborhoods or to-be neighborhoods.  This would offer huge profitability advantages for them, but unfortunately so far their margins and growth are pretty in par with the industry.

They do have an advantage as a publicly traded company of their size.  Lots of access to capital and large capital reserves make it easy for them to have many operations simultaneously in different parts of the country.

They have a healthier history internally compared to competitors.  Their finances have stayed intact even in the worst case scenario and they have shown a better than average ability to rebound after hardship.  This is because of the financial maturity and responsibility management has taken over the years and hopefully this is a culture that continues in the business.

## Sell side VS Buy side

I am more bullish on this one, but here are two arguments for two different opinions.  I will limit them to five points each:

**Sell:**

* They did not hesitate to reduce shareholder value in 2008 instead of alternate debt financing.  This shows that they are willing to do it again.
* Prevailing sentiment is split - there is a possibility of a massive real estate crash in the near future
* Economic conditions are favorable right not, but it is expected that they will not be as favorable in the future
* Some of their corporate paper is sold at quite a high yield, which may be grounds for default if they do not sell shares or more debt in the event of financial difficulties.
* The demand for skilled workers is and will be rising, making it more difficult for PHM to acquire valuable human capital without raising wages.

**Buy:**

* They have steady organic growth
* Management has shown more than once that they are responsible.  In bad times they are capable of sacrificing shareholder value for more shareholder value in the future.  In good times they make good on future obligations early and don’t get too euphoric with expansions and bonuses.
* Their asset and debt structures are very attractive - with adequate coverage of debts and not a lot of outstanding obligations
* They have great ability to generate lots of capital in good times and store that capital away.
* The economic conditions indicate a shortage of residential housing, so even if there is an economic catastrophe in the near future, PHM and other homebuilders will still be needed to fill a 5.5 million house void in the country.  This figure is only going to grow too without federal intervention which either way is advantageous for PHM.

## Valuation

Assuming a dividend growth of 1 %, a 3.8% expected growth from the company and an 8% rate of return, the Gordon model gives them a $10.7 valuation per share. Their intrinsic value calculated from the DCF model is between $70-100, giving an average margin of 35%.  Of course the DCF model makes the assumption that OCF and investments will be stable and follow my predicted growth rates, so this is a subjective valuation no matter how accurate I think it may be.

## Valuation Market Comparison

The average intrinsic values I have found for the industry show that the industry is overvalued by about 15%, giving PHM a potential relative valuation of 50% undervalued.

## Opinion

I would give $PHM a buy rating.  They have a strong, cash generating business model.  There is more risk associated with owning them than a comparable consumer staples business, but there is also much more potential reward and in my opinion the reward is more likely to be realized than the risk.  This is something I would be comfortable holding in my portfolio.

personalfinance,Should I request a refund on my federal student loan payments to put toward other debts?,"Hi!

As back story, I currently have a little over $75K in federal loans. At the beginning of COVID, I had about $81K, which means I paid roughly $6K during COVID to my federal loans. This effectively paid off one of the loans, which was about $1K of the $6K. After I realized federal loans would be in deferment for quite some time, I swapped over to paying off my private loan, and I’ve successfully paid off about $11K of that loan this year, and have about $22K left.

In terms of interest rates, my federal loans range from a 3.76%-6.6% for the 17 separate loans (bachelors and masters degree). My private loan is about 3.5% variable.

I also have my half of a car loan for about $8K, and a personal loan for about $13K, and then varying credit card debt of roughly $15K. 

I’m trying to really get myself in proper order with my financial situation, and just started at a better paying job which will hopefully help. However, I suppose my question would be if it would make sense for me to request a refund of my COVID payments, and use that to pay toward my private loan, or any other of my debts, or if since we are so close to going back into repayment for federal loans, if I should leave it there and just continue tackling my other debts how I have been?

Thank you in advance!

**Buy:**

* They have steady organic growth
* Management has shown more than once that they are responsible.  In bad times they are capable of sacrificing shareholder value for more shareholder value in the future.  In good times they make good on future obligations early and don’t get too euphoric with expansions and bonuses.
* Their asset and debt structures are very attractive - with adequate coverage of debts and not a lot of outstanding obligations
* They have great ability to generate lots of capital in good times and store that capital away.
* The economic conditions indicate a shortage of residential housing, so even if there is an economic catastrophe in the near future, PHM and other homebuilders will still be needed to fill a 5.5 million house void in the country.  This figure is only going to grow too without federal intervention which either way is advantageous for PHM.

## Valuation

Assuming a dividend growth of 1 %, a 3.8% expected growth from the company and an 8% rate of return, the [Gordon model](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gordongrowthmodel.asp) gives them a $10.7 valuation per share. Their intrinsic value calculated from the DCF model is between $70-100, giving an average margin of 35%.  Of course the DCF model makes the assumption that OCF and investments will be stable and follow my predicted growth rates, so this is a subjective valuation no matter how accurate I think it may be.

## Valuation Market Comparison

The average intrinsic values I have found for the industry show that the industry is overvalued by about 15%, giving PHM a potential relative valuation of 50% undervalued.

## Opinion

I would give $PHM a buy rating.  They have a strong, cash generating business model.  There is more risk associated with owning them than a comparable consumer staples business, but there is also much more potential reward and in my opinion the reward is more likely to be realized than the risk.  This is something I would be comfortable holding in my [portfolio](https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/oeedlq/my_value_portfolio/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3).

eth,How should I frame the demand for all things trustless (including DeFi)?,"Of course, a BTC Holdr will tell me that the Fed and central banks will destroy fiat, the inflation is coming and it'll be the end of the world. And of course, I understand how this can be translated to ETH.

But I am trying to find non-apocalipytical arguments for ETH. 

When I think about Ethereum, I think mostly about two things: DeFi and other applications.

DeFi: Goldman Sachs enjoys to brag that they have more developers than Facebook. I already worked for a Bank and I can say that the tech sector is pretty codifiable. Of course, the question is: why should we trust unauditable Credit Suisse's Risk Management if instead we can use protocols like Uniswap and Maker and achieve the same goals?

So I understand that if the demand for trustless finance is big, in some way the profits of the banks, asset managements, insurance companies, mastercard, visa, experian, Delloite: it all will become profit of DeFi protocol (that maybe can pass some of this profits to customers, through lower prices) but also for ETH itself, because Ethereum stakers will get their fair share of the DeFi ecosystem.

My question here is: how do you frame the opportunity for trustless finance? 1% of the world will go trustless? 10%? 100%? How did you get to this conclusion?


Second.

I think that right now it's hard to talk about other applications to the Ethereum blockchain because of the prices of gas, but there are web3 opportunities to solve lots of problems outside of finance: identity, cybersecurity, internet protocol, art, and a bunch of things that I'm not smart enough to think about.

How do you frame these opportunities? Can it ever be meaningful for ETH capitalization?

--

I read a lot about ETH on Bankless Substack and I am quite convinced about this sentence ""If there is meaningful demand for the world finance to go trustless, we'll see today's ETH price as a steal"".

I'm not convinced that there's meaningful demand for trustless finance. I didn't form my mind.",cryptocurrency

cardano,"Cardano Rumor Rundown July 8, 2021","Hey Everyone!

Let's go...

Newly covered today: 

1. IOG says they have started onboarding new SPOs and developers to Alonzo White this week. [https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1412847798274478084](https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1412847798274478084)
2. Charles also confirms that Alonzo White may start Friday but probably Monday due to a natural (and warranted) desire to avoid executing a rollout at the start of a weekend.  [https://youtu.be/yd1eg4QopV8](https://youtu.be/yd1eg4QopV8)

Previously Covered but still interesting:

1. Manuel Chakravarty gave a big update on Hydra (layer 2 scaling). Hydra will not require that the base layer be modified since it will be implemented via Plutus smart contracts. Hydra is actually a collection of protocols including Hydra Head and Hydra Tail. Hydra Head is a symmetric protocol where multiple participants will be online simultaneously for the whole period of the head exchanging messages. Hydra Tail is an asymmetric protocol involving a high performance server and many clients that may be mobile and could be offline for large portions of the tail’s existence. There will also be “inter head &amp; tail networking” which will allow for a network of heads and tails. They have a published research paper on Hydra Head. They are currently writing the Hydra Tail paper.
2. Hydra is distinguished from other layer 2 protocols by its isomorphic properties. This means you will be able to run any smart contract that works on the base layer in a Hydra Head! This is very special. We won’t need special purpose contracts built out just for layer 2. There are some big implications to this. Since a Hydra Head is essentially just a Plutus smart contract, this means you can run a Hydra Head inside another Hydra Head. It’s turtles all the way down, guys. It sounds like they can do this iteratively as much as they want.
3. Aggelos also gave a good presentation on the importance of “skin in the game” in resource based consensus protocols (both proof-of-work and proof-of-stake) and its effect on promotion or discouragement of centralization. He explained how Ouroboros has built-in safeguards to prevent centralization including the K parameter (currently at 500) which caps total rewards per pool and the alpha parameter (currently at 0.3) which splits rewards into a 77% piece and a 23% piece. A pool can take its share of the 77% piece based on the pool’s total stake and its share of the 23% piece based on the pledge of the SPO. A higher alpha parameter makes it less attractive for individual SPOs to proliferate multiple pools since they can’t be as leveraged on their available pledge and still get as big a share of the 23% piece. This also discourages Sybil Attacks. As Cardano on-chain governance progresses, these parameters will be controlled by the community.
4. There will be a Cardano Goguen Summit in September. It will be hybrid digital/in-person.
5. Charles is helping to bring the cryptographer who broke SHA-1 to the University of Wyoming. The Cardano funded blockchain lab there could be on the road to be a powerhouse.

8. Professor Aggelos Kiayias recently dropped a video explaining exactly how Mithril (apparently neckbeard dungeon master talk for elf armor) is going to allow for Perfect Cardano (ADA) wallets that combine the ease of use and convenience of light wallets with the trustlessness of full node wallets. We also learned exactly how Mithril is going to work. [https://youtu.be/LhepJFCyWRk](https://youtu.be/LhepJFCyWRk)
9. In proof-of-work, bootstrapping can be done with blockheaders. This won’t do in proof-of-stake since we need information about stakeholder distribution to confirm block validity.
10. Mithril fixes this by being a cryptographic construction that enables a population of stakeholders to issue a signature consistent with certain constraints.
11. For Mithril to work in proof-of-stake, it needs three crucial properties: 1) it needs to enforce a threshold ratio of stakeholders before the signature is issued; 2) the pre-signature fragments must be independently verified and subject to public aggregation; and 3) it must be efficient in the sense that the final signature is of constant size and is logarithmically dependent on the # of stakeholders.
12. Stakeholders will issue special Mithril keys along with the normal cryptographic key material. Then at regular intervals, full nodes will test whether they can produce a pre-signature fragment. Only a random subset of stakeholders will be eligible to produce a pre-signature fragment. When a sufficient # of pre-signature fragments have been issued by eligible stakeholders then it will be possible to aggregate the fragments into a final signature.
13. This will be a checkpoint that will be verifiable with respect to previous check points all the way back to the genesis block. Such checkpoints will be cryptographic commitments of the relevant UTXOs.
14. Since the checkpoints will be trustless, a light client (i.e. wallet) will only need to verify the sequence of checkpoints up to the current time to trustlessly bootstrap.
15. The ecosystem is growing so fast, it’s hard to keep up with all the projects without these infographics at this point. [https://twitter.com/Dr\_shwetaPHD/status/1398783893638103040](https://twitter.com/Dr_shwetaPHD/status/1398783893638103040)

78. We saw segments on various newer partner entities like Nervos, Orion Protocol, and Revuto. Nervos is a UTXO proof-of-work blockchain which is building a cross-chain bridge with Cardano so that you can use your ADA on Nervos dApps and vice versa. Interoperability is a big theme for Nervos and they plan to have a working testnet within a month. Orion Protocol is building a terminal that will allow for decentralized non-custodial trading across centralized and decentralized exchanges. They say this would not require you to KYC or even have an account with any of these exchanges. Revuto is an online subscription management service that recently completed a $10MM token sale on Cardano.
79. It was also revealed that Wolfram Labs, COTI, and IOHK have a three-way partnership (a ménage à tech) to build an NFT auction site. The people from Wolfram were talking about very interesting things including live minting during streaming events and automated upload to IPFS. COTI will be building out auction and bidding mechanisms in ADAPay.
80. Professor Aggelos Kiayias gave us an update on research including that Ouroboros Chronos and Hydra papers have both been accepted into conferences/journals. Chronos will provide Cardano with a global concept of time that doesn’t rely on any outside timekeeper. Prof. Kiayias also pointed out that Hydra is distinguishable from other layer two protocols in that the scripting language is identical to that of the base layer in Cardano such that any dApp that can run on Cardano will run on the Hydra L2. This is a huge plus and superior to many other layer two solutions in other ecosystems where the base layer dApps will not run on layer two. Finally, the Mithril paper has been submitted for peer review. It will provide Cardano light wallets with Succinct Non-interactive Arguments of Knowledge that will give us the best of both worlds: no delays for syncing as in full node wallets while still preserving trustlessness.

83. People are starting to realize that the Stakehound private key loss in ETH may attract unwanted regulatory attention to Ethereum 2.0 while this problem could never have occurred in Cardano. Also, only a few days later another ETH stakepool (this time SharedStake...the sixth biggest ETH Stakepool) allegedly experiences a rugpull that some are valuing at over $30MM. This is another problem that could not happen in Cardano staking. It feels like we stepped into the ring, they rang the bell, and ETH just started punching itself in the head.

investing,"Both the Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg have picked up on Zoltan Pozsar's most recent article, which warns of coming chaos from an accumulation of cash in the Federal Reserve's reverse repurchase facility (RRP)","https://www.efinancialcareers.com/news/2021/07/zoltan-pozsar-credit-suisse  
&gt;Pozsar estimates that use of the facility has jumped by $300bn since the Fed increased the interest rate on the RRP from 0 to 5bps last month: the higher rate means it no longer makes any sense to hold lower yielding Treasury bills and Pozsar thinks money will continue to flow into the RRP throughout the summer, with up to $1.3 trillion being switched out of Treasury bills by August.  **This in turn could cause issues for the $400bn of Treasury bills that Pozsar calculates will still need to be bought by banks over the next two months, and which are likely to be purchased with non-operating deposits at banks like JPMorgan and Bank of America, which could in turn have curious effects on the markets as banks have less to put into FX swaps, longer dated Treasury bills or mortgaged backed securities.**",finance

The company's US market value has fallen by more than 20% since a Chinese regulator told online stores to pull the app.

Beijing's cybersecurity watchdog says the app illegally collected users' personal data.

The lawsuits, which were filed in federal court in New York and Los Angeles on Tuesday, say Didi failed to disclose ongoing talks it was having with Chinese authorities about its compliance with cybersecurity laws and regulations.

The complaints named Didi's chief Executive officer Will Wei Cheng and several other executives and directors. The lead underwriters for the company's share sale - Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase - were also named as defendants.

CryptoCurrency,"We are all concerned about fiat, we also want to get out of corrupt banking system and manage our own finances, is all of this true or a bubble we created?","I was just thinking about some years ago some part of the population was super concerned about privacy, i remember reading about Snowden and how shit hit the fan hitting everyone around the globe... Then reading in here and in other places i thought wow so many people thinking the same, concerned about our privacy, about how companies and governments manage our data, etc etc... But then i realized this was a small bubble i was in, in fact the majority of the people kept posting all their life in facebook, then in instagram, then on snapchat and now on tiktok, like the majority give a fk, or maybe they say ohhh yes im concerned about my privacy!! But then they post about all their lifes in public places, geotags also activated, etc etc...

Then i thought, in here is happening the same?? Are we in a bubble that we only read people that are interested in crypto so we try to maintain our heads positive reading each others? Whats happening outside? We all know the massive fiat printings, the negative interest rates in some places, etc etc... But what does the average Joe think about this, are they interested in crypto?

I think that this time since $$$$ is involved, it might be different and we could see a change. Plus banks and other big players entering the space, might bring crypto oportunities to normal people that before they wouldnt sign up into a exchange or create their metamask wallet.

personalfinance,529 question / scholarships / loans etc.,"Hello everyone please forgive my ignorance here. I’m new to this. 😬

In the fall my child is going to an expensive public university in the northeast. 

Tuition, room and board etc in the 60k range. 

She received an 18k scholarship per year.
She received an 8k grant from the university. As far as we know this is determined year by year and is not guaranteed. 
Federal loans around 4K combined. 

Her grandparents set up a 529 that has about 60k right now. 

My question is how to proceed funding the gap? I am leaning towards private loans with immediate interest repayment as I have a decent enough job and can help with interest until she assumes the responsibility after graduating. 

How should I use the 529. Pay the first year fully and close it out? That would reduce her interest by 1 year. Or should we take a little at a time? 
If she cashes out a 529 freshman year, would that limit her financial aid eligibility next year?",finance
CryptoCurrency,I am closing all my fiat bank accounts with the exception of one checking..,"You may call me crazy, but I am in the process of closing all my fiat checking/savings accounts. I never liked to keep all my eggs in one basket so I had my funds spread out over multiple banks. 

Now I am not rich by any means and my emergency fund is rather low but the point is I believe so heavily in crypto that I have determined that I don’t need multiple checking/savings accounts. I just need one checking account to pay my bills and then that’s it. The rest goes into crypto.

You may think I’m crazy, but crypto is liquid enough to where if I had a big emergency I could front it on a CC then withdrawal crypto if necessary. 

Interest rates aren’t paying anything in savings accounts either so I might as well stake my emergency fund with a better yield and go all in with crypto!

gaming,I've been griefed in 7 days to die and I don't know if I can do anything to punish or report the player.,"Hello,

I'm just fuming right now... 

I was on my first playthrough on 7 days to die, I just picked up the game, and I was at day 45. Suddenly a player connects to my server and we chat together with the in-game chat, all was good we were friendly. Then night comes so I invite him to my base, he had no clothes and no tools so I gave him some primitive stuff and all was good. Then, I was minding my own business crafting stuff on my workbench and he simply shotgunned me to the face. 

After that I tried running back to my base but he used my own sniper rifle to hunt me down. After a few minutes he told me through chat that he destroyed all my safes and workstations, and made all my stuff disappear. He then quietly left the server after telling me I was the 4th guy to whom he did that in the same day, and that he enjoyed every single bit of it.

I'm already contributing the maximum amount (per federal limits) to my 401(k) and HSA. I know the next step is to contribute to an IRA. My income exceeds the income limits for contributing to a Roth IRA. I understand that I can still contribute to a traditional IRA but that it won't be tax deductible at my income level. Would it be better to contribute to a traditional IRA regardless or should I attempt to do a backdoor Roth IRA? 

I have an emergency fund, no debt, and I'm on a pretty healthy path to retirement with my current 401(k). I am also anticipating (but not counting on) some windfalls prior to retirement age, including a very sizeable (like $3M) inheritance. Should I even bother with another retirement fund or should I do something else entirely, like invest in index funds or ETFs?

personalfinance,Question about tax deductions and 401k contributions,"So I have a question. I thought that contributions to your 401k were done pre-tax and the tax was applied to the remaining amount. 

So for example if my gross paycheck was for $10,000, I paid 35% in federal income tax, and I decide to put $1,000 of that in my company's 401k program what would my taxed income be? Am I paying $3,500 in Fed tax (35% of $10,000) or am I paying $3,150 in fed tax (35% of $9,000 because of the $1,000 401k contribution)?",finance
CryptoMarkets,➜ Why DeFi Is More Than A Ponzi Scam ?? | Econteric.com,"Some people claim that DeFi is a scam ponzi because there are a lot of pumps and dumps. Everything on Twitter is shilling all kinds of different projects. Now there are a lot of risks involved, and the projects are not fully audited. So a lot of people are wondering this is a ponzi scam of part of the innovation cycle.

In this article, we will tell why DeFi is more than just a ponzi scam.

We cover 3 things today:

1. Why DeFi feels like Ponzi
2. Why DeFi is not Ponzi
3. Future of DeFi.

When talking about DeFi here, we are referring to the general ecosystem and not a single project, because the ecosystem is doing quite well in general.

Sure, there are some systems around the world with plenty of scams. This includes traditional financial market. But you cannot discredit the entire system because of a few black sheep.

DeFi is a new system and industry. There will be a few scams coming out but you cannot define this for the entire ecosystem, which is doing a lot of good and interesting things.

# DeFi and Ponzi

If you google the keyword ""DeFi and Ponzi"", you can see a lot of articles saying that DeFi is like Ponzi, just another name called, DeFi is basically ICO 2.0 where people are pumping and dumping, whale manipulation, etc.

**What it feels like:** Everything is just memes and a joke. Is this even serious? Why do I have to join? How is this legal and how can people make money? Projects with 100% APY; where does the money come from and why is it valuable? People just swapping or trading tokens together, but it was in a circle, a pyramid scheme.

**What it actually is:** Liquidity Mining (Synthetix) and Yield Farming (Compound) are ways to bootstrap growth and to reward a decentralised community to take ownership of the protocol. High rewards for risk takers in the early days is rationally sound. And when payout for the risk takers happen all at once, it feels like the APY is insanely high.

# Why DeFi is not Ponzi

**1.   Grow the Pie**

Answer the above question briefly: this is not necessarily true. If you look at the distribution of the entire economic value as a pie, a ponzi scam is where you are extracting value every time someone is coming in. This means that the pie doesn't change much, you give your money to someone else to receive new tokens.

DeFi is like the pie, that keeps growing. There are many projects/protocols under construction, such as lending protocol, Dex protocol, portfolio asset management protocol, etc. They're in beta testing in this early stage and they do not try to capitalise on the entire financial market which is a big field.

Each DeFI tries to do well with a specific purpose, they are like small lego blocks, combined together to create various different products. This is composability, the protocols can interact with each other and make the pie grows. Just like in order to make a delicious pie, we have to add more kinds of fillings. This is why it is so interesting and exciting.

On the protocol side, the protocols with all these little ecosystems and applications whose own community can grow by interacting together.

With the platform which is pretty neutral because they are technology, the added value from connecting buyers and sellers. If we look at economics, this is supply and demand, and they only make sense when there is equilibrium and interacting together.

The protocols/applications are trying to build to the playing field, from which suppliers and buyers can come to interact with each other. The more interactions, the more economic value added is created and the pie keeps growing.

**2.   Experimenting with New Business Models**

According to the economics perspective, if you observe the previous business models, it is usually one-sided. Going back to the above example, if I make a cake, you go to a bakery and buy it, there is nothing more I can do like asking a few people to try a new or similar flavour. Supply and demand are still very dependent.

However, when we look back about 10 years ago, a new business model emerged called the platform. We have Amazon, AirBnb, Uber, etc. which provide the technology to connect the two sides of the ecosystem together to transact. This creates a lot of economic value.

Suppose I am an economist, the question is: how to quantify the economic value created? We can then calculate metrics like GDP, because it represents the growth of a platform.

With these values, you can calculate the value-added with all of these transaction fees. But there is a lot of intangible value being created in the ecosystem, which is connecting two sides of the platforms together for easier interaction. By reducing transaction costs, it increases economic value. This is what an economist observes and we are working on it. Specialities focus on the digital economy and how to compute them.

I realised that what we are doing with native tokens is considering how valuable they are to the ecosystem. Tokens can have a lot of utility and represent value. More specifically, these tokens are representing the value of some ecosystem.

That way, we are assigning a monetary policy value to the economies that the system is creating. And we can calculate metrics, like GDP. All of the above gets interesting.

**3.   New P2P Incentive Models**

We are developing new p2p incentive models. One thing about decentralised finance as a whole is the complete elimination of middlemen. Instead of centralised power in one person/place, they are distributed equally to everyone. Now, we have more money to be distributed, instead of sending them to intermediaries. In traditional finance, for example, a public initially listed on a stock exchange must go through banks and pay them an expensive fee, but these are eliminated in decentralised finance, where those companies can list their tokens on dexes, provide liquidity, and lots of other incentives.

This is very interesting. We are phasing out intermediaries that are stealing a lot of money. But the bad thing is we have a lot of money not distributed: how do we allocate them? How do we reward the right types of people?

I would say that these will keep moving forward because we realise that capitalism does not work so much anymore and is not going to be sustainable in the long-term. That makes us look forward to new paradigms of capitalism, like social capitalism kind of thing.

We need to have lots of new p2p incentive models and the best place to test is DeFi which has liquidity farming, yield farming, etc. For these interesting mining and incentive mechanisms, we are trying to try many different incentive mechanisms and create many interesting future mechanisms.

# Future of DeFi

There are two things that we see in DeFi's future:

1. **On-chain Financial Experiments and Mechanisms to be used in TradFi**  
The first thing we are seeing in DeFI right now is that you don't have many transactions in the real world. That goes back to my point of the whole GDP accountability because we are trading nominal value, not much real value transactions since you exit the crypto space and transfer the money to the bank.  
Right now, everything is still within the on-chain sphere. DeFi's future is to allow these experiments and experiences to interact within the off-chain world. Because the off-chain world is very ineffective (like the financial system, the governance system, etc.).  
What we are trying to do now is to run all these little experiments/tests. If it works in on-chain well, we can extend to the off-chain world, creating a bridge to connect the 2 worlds. This is really interesting.
2. **Economic Valuation from Ecosystems**  
Second, we can now more easily calculate the economic values generated from specific individual ecosystems, while also moving them off-chain world and account for them in a much more equitable way. It leads to governance which has better resources/data points to be accounting for all these different changes in the world.

# Conclude

Here is a quick summary of the Ponzi Scam and DeFi and I would say that not all DeFi platforms are Ponzi Scam. One of them could be a scam and you need to check it out carefully. For non-scam projects, they are fun experiences. We need to learn to understand how it works and explore what kind of experiments capital allocation and governance system that could be.

Honestly, I am going to tell you that there is so much economics literature out there, talking about the technical and the academic aspects of all these experiments, but we never really had a chance to explore them. There are a lot of interesting monetary policy mechanisms in academic papers, but we don't really use them. We have a lot of dynamic variables in DeFi space and we can test these experiences.

In fact, in the economics space, a lot of people are experimenting with many different theories on DeFi and if it works which will lead to a huge change and bring DeFi even more powerful. Their users also become part of DeFi's future development. An example of a testnet is the experiments of crypto and crypto itself is the experiments of the off-chain world. This is super fascinating and now one of the best times to be.

**TLDR**:

DeFi is still in its early stages and it is still risky. There are scams here and there. But we should not use a few black sheep to define the space as a ponzi scam. DeFi will develop further in the future with better testing. And it is clear that its potential will develop very quickly later.

DeFi is innovating fast. We should analyse and exploit the strengths. Scam projects will still emerge. Our continuous education and knowledge will help reduce that.

**Get smart:** DeFi is not exactly a Ponzi Scam, it is still evolving and will have limitations in it.

**Get smarter:** The growth potential of DeFi is huge, we see the traditional financial system, the governance system is very ineffective. Thing resources are under-utilised and expensive. DeFi is trying this problem and if it succeeds it will be revolutionary.",cryptocurrency

I’m a 2020 computer science grad working in defense, currently making just under 110k. I’ve been working at the same place since before graduation, and as of now have no intention of leaving as the benefits are too good to pass up (7% 401k match vested immediately, fully paid healthcare, dental, very generous time off, etc).

In terms of savings: I have ~15k in a Roth IRA, ~24k in my 401k, and 500 in a HSA. The IRA is maxed for 2021, the 401k is on track to max, and the HSA I haven’t set contributions for, but likely will also try to max. I also have a 6k emergency fund (3 months expenses), and 28k set aside in a HYSA.

In terms of debts: I have 28k in fed student loans on pause till October, all of which are in the rather uncomfortable 4-7% range.

Now the 28k I saved in the HYSA are meant for those loans, and I was gonna pay them all off at the end of deferment, but a recent post in r/studentloans alerted me of the SmartBuy program run in my state (Maryland).

From the Maryland website:
“Maryland SmartBuy 3.0 financing provides up to 15% of the home purchase price for the borrower to pay off their outstanding student debt with a maximum payoff amount of $30,000.”

After seeing this, I have no idea what the correct move is. On one hand I can go debt free, continue renting, and save/invest for a future home on my own timeline, but lose out on 28k. On the other hand I can buy a home at 23/24, save 28k, but must shoulder a debt an order of magnitude larger.

Our capitalist society is essentially a giant game of monopoly, and those Bitcoin rich assholes know this, so now that they have and are acquiring most of the concentration of money out of any other player on the board, they are buying the other players out, and they’re only going to continue to buy out every company against bitcoin, every politician against it, all to make them accept, and integrate bitcoin into their businesses, networks, and legislations. Just like like the last rich assholes before them made the world integrate Facebook &amp; Google into every smart phone. There’s no stopping it at this point. 

Someone builds a quantum computer to try &amp; hack Bitcoin? Those rich assholes will already have a thousand quantum computers protecting the bitcoin network by then; just like Jeff Bezos, or any other billionaire does today, those rich assholes will buy out their enemies. 

Ever wonder why Visa card, PayPal, JP morgan chase, Goldman Sachs, etc, are now all pro bitcoin after being so negative about it only a few years ago? It’s because the rich assholes in Bitcoin combined already bought out a majority share of their companies stocks, giving us the voting power to vote them into integrating Bitcoin into their companies. 

They’re buying up all the shares of the money companies first, anyone paying attention can see it. 

Everything else will be easy to buy majority share control over after owning the financial transmission companies. 

One day, those Bitcoin rich assholes will likely own a majority share of Google, Amazon, every major bank, and every major company in the world. And idk if you guys know how the federal reserve works, but its shares are owned by every major charter bank in the US, so once Bitcoin rich assholes own a majority share of every major bank as they’re buying up now, then they will eventually literally own the federal reserve. 

But the moral of the story is that it’s too late to stop this train. You can either join the rich assholes &amp; hop onto the internet 2.0 of financial energy storage &amp; transmission, or you can be left behind, just like all the Ma and Pa shops that were left behind and destroyed by the rich assholes of the last internet 1.0 of data information storage and transmission. 
Ma and Pa shops who they choked out by using the internet to take their customers, and then bought out for pennies on the dollar after their websites choked them out financially and left them in debt and ruin, just like crypto exchanges have been choking out the banks and investment firms for the last 12 years by attracting their customers to Bitcoin exchanges, just as the first internet did with Ma and Pa shop’s customers.

personalfinance,28 year old looking for investing advice,"Hey everyone, I am looking for some general investing advice. So I am 28 years old and not including retirement, I have about 110k in savings. I currently live with parents and I plan on moving out of my parents place in 4-5 years. I am trying to formulate an investment plan for the next 4-5 years to make the most out of my time living at home.

Right now, I make about 108k a year. This boils down to a monthly income of $4638 a month after taxes and retirement distributions. Typically my monthly expenses on average are $1400 a month. To be conservative in my estimates though, lets assume 2k. This leaves me with $2638 a month to place in an investment account.

5 years I think is a short horizon, so I was trying to be conservative with regard to the portfolio. This is the portfolio I came up with. Please feel free to critique me and tell me if I'm doing something stupid. The bonds I think are no brainer, they are safe and stable. I went with a 40/60 split between bonds and riskier assets. 35% is in index funds, with a majority being consumer staples as I've been told they are more resilient in recessions. The Gold I added as an inflationary hedge given the low interest rate environment we live in and the fact that it is not correlated to the stock market. The real estate is also there to diversify from the stock market while trying to get a good ROI.

**Portfolio 1**

TickerName Allocation

BSV Vanguard Short-Term Bond ETF 40.00%

GLDSPDR Gold Shares 9.00%

VDC Vanguard Consumer Staples ETF 25.00%

VNQ Vanguard Real Estate ETF 15.00%

VTSAX Vanguard Total Stock Mkt Idx Adm 11.00%

I am a total financial newbie, so I don't have any true skills in portfolio analysis. But from the little back testing I did on the portfolio, I could see it had a CAGR of 7% and a Max Drawdown of 21%(08 financial crisis). This doesn't seem too bad. Not sure though if this is a good risk to reward ratio or what the best way to measure risk is besides looking at the drawdown and saying, hey ma we only lost a 5th of our money.

Ultimately this account will be used to purchase a home within 4-5 years. The only major expense I have on the horizon is potentially a wedding in 2 years. I'm dating someone at the moment and I am going to assume this could be in the cards for me.

Assuming this account does grow at 7% annually, with a monthly contribution of $2638, I should have about 342k in the account. This is more than enough for a down payment/rainy day fund within the areas I would like to buy.

personalfinance,Debt consolidation loan options,"Hello all, I’m looking to get my financial house in order after a year of reduced income. Unfortunately some of my unavoidable expenses went on credit, and I have about $15,000 in CC debt (between 19-21% APR) that I will be carrying for the immediate future. 

I’ve received an offer from Marcus (Goldman Sachs) for $15,000 at 13% over 36 months, no penalty for earlier payoff, and I would very likely pay it off sooner.  

The interest rate still seems quite high, and I’m wondering if a local credit union would be more competitive. Are there other, better options for a consolidation loan?",finance
personalfinance,Crawling out of Credit Card Debt,"I'm desperate for help. If anyone with more knowledge that I do can just peek at my situation and maybe offer some advice - anything at all - I'd really really appreciate it. I posted my information at the end if you'd like to just skip to that. 

I did real the rules - I hope this abides. I'm not asking for money or handouts, purely just advice for someone who's been reading non-stop and feels like it's going nowhere. 

**Long story as short as possible:**

At age 18, I needed extra money to live and not be homeless and pay off medical debt - and I regretfully took out my first credit card. I didn't research other methods or any assistance. I was so desperate and needed the cash so quickly that I just opened up the credit card.

This had been a cycle for years - and I want to break it SO bad. I needed a plane ticket at one point - and opened a credit card. My school loans didn't cover a year so I took out a loan and a credit card. I made bad decisions continuously for so long. I hate to bring emotion into this but I fell into depression so bad that I had to almost ignore the debt and act like it didn't exist just to not have panic attacks over this every day. 

**Now I'm almost 31**, and have been out my bad life situation for almost 3 years now. I couldn't save up anything so sold all of my belongings and moved out of state. Mentally and financially I'm more stable than I have ever been (besides the debt). I haven't opened a new line for quite a while, besides a car loan that's technically with my husband even though I pay it. I'm married now, but I'm a plateau with my life where I can't move forward until I get this debt drastically minimized. I'm in an apartment, I know I can't get a mortgage let alone house repairs for it, I want kids but I would have to pay and adopt if I do. I want the family but I'm stuck in debt. Does anyone have ANY advice on how I can proceed - any methods to get this consolidated or a service to budget with that I don't have to pay for - anything at all. I need a savings, I need a retirement fund, I need my money to stop going to credit cards only to accrue interest and practically negate that payment.  

I've been trying to pay off small cards first, and I have closed a couple and closed them successfully, but it feels like as soon as I do that (or get close), an emergency happens and I need the money. I don't have a savings to counterbalance this, because my money goes into so many different credit card payments. 

I'm willing to consolidate my debt if it's worth it. I don't know how but if I can reduce these huge interest rates and payment quantities each month - and help my credit score for when I need a mortgage, I will consider it for sure. 

Maybe at least tell me this situation isn't as bad as I'm thinking it is. It feels real bad!

investing,Hypothetical - interest rates in recession,"Hi,

I have been trying to understand what would happen if the economy is gone into a recession? 

Looking at the 2008 records Bank of England dropped from 5% to 0.5% by end of 2009 and now it is 0.1%.

Are we looking at potentially -3-4% rates? I find it a bit mind numbing as inflation is on the rise and loads of talks about a possible ‘crash’. But if the no 1 solution for recession is lowering the interest rates, how could it be applied in current already zero-ish environment. Inflation is going to reduce value of money and on top we would give banks money to keep our money…cant see that helping anything!

Bitcoin,MARKETS Digital currency company Circle to go public via SPAC at $4.5 billion valuation,"Circle plans to go public by the end of the year through a SPAC with Concord Acquisition Corp.
The announcement comes as regulators seek more clarity around the trading and issuers of stablecoins — digital currency that’s designed to be less volatile than other crypto — with one proposal suggesting they obtain bank charters.
Payments and digital currency firm Circle plans to go public later this year through a merger with special purpose acquisition company Concord Acquisition Corp.

The deal, which Circle announced on Thursday, is expected to close in the fourth quarter and would value the company at $4.5 billion.

“We just see an incredible opportunity to grow rapidly and grow around the world, and we think that this set of transactions and becoming a public company really sets us up to be a trusted platform in this in this digital currency industry,” Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire said on CNBC’s “Squawk Box” Thursday morning.

The eight-year-old startup is best known for co-creating the U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin USD Coin, or USDC.
Stablecoins are digital currencies designed to be less volatile than cryptocurrencies by pegging their market value to an outside asset like the U.S. dollar. Tether is one of the best known and most controversial ones, along with USDC and the initially Facebook-led Diem (formerly known as Libra). There are currently $26 billion of USDC in circulation, Allaire told “Squawk Box.”
The announcement of Circle’s deal comes amid growing concern by regulators that there should be more transparency in the trading of stablecoins, the reserves backing them and the overreliance on them to enable trading in decentralized finance or DeFi. 

In December, Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., along with Reps. Jesus Garcia, D-Ill., and Stephen Lynch, D-Mass., introduced Stablecoin Tethering and Bank Licensing Enforcement Act, or the STABLE Act.

The legislation would require issuers to obtain bank charters and keep reserve funds equal in amount to the number of stablecoins they issue, with the Federal Reserve.
“We’ve seen growing adoption and usage of the USDC across an ever-widening range of use cases,” Jeremy Fox-Geen, Circle’s chief financial officer, according to a transcript of an investor conference call filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday.

“While we believe that the use case for USDC is the same as the use case for a dollar, for many of those use cases, USDC is the better product,” Fox-Geen said, because it can move and settle faster and more cheaply.
Payment systems adoption
“We operate this market infrastructure of USDC which doesn’t have a clear comparable,” Allaire said on “Squawk Box.” “It’s a fundamental innovation in payment systems, so you might think about large payment technology companies,” like Visa or Mastercard.

Earlier this year, Visa settled a USDC transaction on its payment network. The move lays the groundwork to potentially support a digital dollar and other central bank digital currencies worldwide. 

“On the other hand, we’re building this suite of what we call transaction and treasury services – those look more similar to at-scale, financial services platforms. It’s a diversified set of businesses,” Allaire added.
Circle also provides other commerce and financial applications for businesses. Allaire said on the same investor conference call that customers are “highly global,” with more than 50% outside the U.S., and that the company is investing aggressively to expand its international digital currency payments and treasury services operations.

Allaire, who is also the company’s co-founder, will remain CEO of the company. Bob Diamond, chairman of Concord Acquisition Corp. and CEO of Atlas Merchant Capital, will join the board.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Should I reduce student debt burden and refinance or keep same strategy?,"Wondering if reddit can help advise me on the best way to tackle my student loans while maintaining a sense of financial health.

I currently have $21,000 in student debt (with a private lender, eg SoFi, Earnest, LendKey). The interest rate is 3.04% and the monthly payment is $500. I have no other debt, make a reasonable salary at a stable job in a HCOL area and manage to pay only 17% of my gross salary for rent. My loan payment is around 13% of my monthly salary. I also have a $10,000 emergency fund, $13,000 in a brokerage account (all ETFs), and $14,000 in a 401(k) and Roth IRA; I would say I'm in a relatively healthy financial position.

My issue is that I hate being in debt. My student loan payments used to be much higher as I was aggressively working to reduce my debt burden--I only started saving/investing about a year ago. I refinanced several times to lower the interest rate and, now that I'm investing a bit, I feel less pressure to slash my debt than I used to. However, I'm beginning to think that sticking to my current strategy of paying $500/month and tucking a little bit away isn't the best way to handle my finances.

So my question is, does it make sense to pull a chunk of money out of my savings or investments and reduce my student debt by $5,000-$10,000 and then refinance the remainder so my payments/interest rate will be even more manageable? Or does it make sense to take even more out and then just aggressively finish paying off the debt and hold back on saving? Or is saving and paying down debt as is the optimal strategy? I suppose its a somewhat subjective question relative to your risk tolerance but I am curious as to what the general consensus is.",finance
personalfinance,Is refinancing student loans as straight forward as it seems?,"My wife had a fair amount of student loans when she graduated. The interest rate on her remaining loans (private loans) is 4.5% which didn't seem crazy so the idea of refinancing was always kind of on the back burner.

Since interest rates are so low, I wanted to look at refinancing them. Is it as simple as applying with a company, they pay off the old loan, and you make payments on the new loan to them?

Sorry if that's a really basic / dumb question, we've just never refinanced anything before.

Also, any particular companies that you've had good or bad experiences with?

Thanks for any help!",finance
stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Thursday, July 8, 2021","**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, July 8, 2021**

Stocks dipped across the board today, putting a stop to the recent record-setting rally that has seen both the Nasdaq (QQQ) and S&amp;P 500 (SPY) reach countless fresh intraday highs in the last six weeks or so. The SPY and Dow Jones (DIA) both fell roughly 0.9% while the tech-heavy QQQ fared slightly better, closing 0.65% down. It seems there a few differing factors that contributed to the drop today, including but not limited to, (1) rising coronavirus fears outside of the US due to the highly contagious Delta variant, (2) the Fed’s June Meeting Minutes, which showed members are increasingly talking about accelerating the timeline to taper quantitative easing, (3) a disappointing weekly unemployment report, and (4) general profit-taking after such a monster rally in the market. In positive news, the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield sank for the fourth straight day, hovering around a multi-month low at 1.29%, a sign that inflation fears are further tapering. 

In a sign of rising concerns over the highly contagious coronavirus delta variant, the Japanese made a last minute announcement that a state of emergency would be re-instituted across Tokyo and that all events would take place behind closed doors, with no spectators, walking back an earlier decision to allow locals to attend the games. On Wednesday, 16 days before the Opening Ceremony, the [Tokyo Metropolitan Government reported 920 COVID cases](https://stopcovid19.metro.tokyo.lg.jp/en), over 200 more than any other single-day total since May. On Thursday, it reported 896, the second-highest count since May. Other countries, like India and Brazil, are also dealing with an extremely worrying surge of cases. Even in the US, where roughly 50% of those eligible are fully vaccinated, the country is seeing a small surge in cases recently, with the delta variant accounting for 51.7% of all new infections. 

Yesterday, the Federal Reserve released the June Meeting minutes, which are notes about what was discussed in the latest meeting, which helps market participants decipher that path forward for monetary policy and possible timelines for any adjustments. The Fed said the economic recovery “was generally seen as not having yet been met”, but said they are ready to act if inflationary pressures indeed begin to materialize. The minutes said, “Participants generally judged that, as a matter of prudent planning, it was important to be well positioned to reduce the pace of asset purchases, if appropriate, in response to unexpected economic developments, including faster-than anticipated progress toward the Committee’s goals or the emergence of risks that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals”. This is not surprising, as I have been saying for weeks now, as the pace of economic recovery improves, quantitative easing, or the purchase of government bonds in order to inject money into the economy, is always the first policy to be tapered. I am not worried about the tapering of quantitative easing and encourage everyone to read up about the 2013 Taper Tantrum, which happened when the Fed announced QE would be tapered since the economy had largely recovered from the 2008 crisis by then.

In other news, after a strong run of outperformance in reports about the labor market, the most recent weekly unemployment report showed new jobless claims unexpectedly tick higher. According to the Department of Labor, there were 373,000 new jobless claims filed last week, higher than the 350,000 expected. While it is slightly disappointing, jobless claims in the US have been continuously declining for months, a sign that the labor market continues to improve as the US continues to reopen.

Ian Shepherdson, Chief Economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics said, “The consensus ignored the tendency for unadjusted claims to rise in weeks when July 4 falls on a Sunday, so the risk was always to the upside. But this is noise, not signal. The seasonal adjustments are struggling simultaneously with the July 4 holiday period and the annual automakers’ retooling shutdowns, which can make the headline numbers even more volatile than usual. The noise will persist through late July, but we have no doubt that the underlying trend will remain downwards."" I agree and remain encouraged by the pace of recovery in the labor market. 

Another potential explanation for today’s pullback, coupled with the other reasons listed, may be general profit taking after such a monster run by the broader market. Since mid-May, the Nasdaq and SPY are up 12.3% and 6% respectively, a great run by any judgement. Nothing ever goes straight up, sometimes dips are needed for the market to recharge for another move higher. 

Looking ahead, market participants are waiting for Q2 earnings season, which is set to kick off next week with big banks reporting. 

**Highlights**

* The Labor Department's monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Summary showed U.S. job openings increased to 9.209 million in May. This followed a downwardly revised 9.193 million in April, which was brought down from the 9.286 million previously reported
* U.S. mortgage applications declined for a second straight week last week, declining to the lowest level in a year-and-a-half as home price growth and low housing inventories weighed further on purchasing activity. 
* The NFL and Twitter (TWTR) are extending a media partnership that will leverage Twitter Spaces, the social-media network's live-audio feature. The NFL says it has more than 20 Spaces sessions planned for the upcoming season; they will include participation from players and other NFL personalities. Other aspects of the partnership will include postings of curated videos, Twitter polls and other content.
* Airbus delivered 297 airplanes in the first half of the year after a surge of handover activity in June, the European planemaker said on Thursday. US-rival Boeing (BA), on the other hand, has more orders in the books for planes but only managed to deliver 111 planes so far this year.
* Tesla (TSLA) introduced a cheaper version of the Model Y in China, as the company is facing increased pressure from Chinese regulators and local competitors. 
* Beyond Meat (BYND) is expanding its product portfolio by launching plant-based chicken-tenders.

I'm 30 and making about $45000/yr and my wife is probably closer to about $35000/yr. We're currently renting (for very cheap), partially because of the housing market, and we like where we live.

Probably about 35k between a couple retirement accounts, and a then like 15k of student loans between the two of us not a terrible interest rate (will pay these off quickly once payments resume again, also waiting on that sweet sweet loan forgiveness I keep getting my hopes up on)

However, we have almost 100k savings which kind up crept up because we're both savers. Usually saving quite a bit every month relative to our income.

My thought was keep enough for a 20% down payment and closing cost for a house in our price range in my savings account, then invest the rest in ""safe and boring"" stocks/etfs.

Again just looking for some feedback on this, I know it's unusual for people who make so little to actually have a bit of money.

personalfinance,Are physician loans generally better than conventional loans?,"Our situation:
My partner is a fresh dentist hoping to get into ortho school (3 yrs will have no income during the time) starting 1 year from now. She is currently a resident hospital dentist making around 60k. I am employed making 100k w/ a 15% contingent bonus.

We are looking to purchase a house at the location where she attends ortho school (1 year from now). We have 20k saved for a down payment.

We will have the option to utilize a physician loan which requires 0% down and has no pmi but generally has a higher interest rate.

I’m trying to determine if the physician loan would be better since we won’t have 20% down for 9/10 places where we would end up. At what interest rate difference is no pmi generally worth it?

personalfinance,Should I stick with law school or delay graduation to go to med school?,"Law was kinda the path of least resistance for me with my current major (political science), but I think I'd have more of a passion for medicine and I don't really have much passion for the practice of law. I'll lay out reasons for both below and let me know if I am making a financially very stupid decision for context I will be entering my senior year of undergrad this fall

Law school: I have a very high LSAT and a high GPA, ""biglaw"" is easily achievable with the schools I am likely to get into, and I stand a decent chance of full rides to much of the T14, but I am interested in federal/SCOTUS clerking (I know odds are low for that no matter where I go), so I am not sure I could turn down a Harvard/Stanford/Yale acceptance even though that would mean a lot of debt. I don't think I could make it in Biglaw for more than a year, maybe two, the whole idea of biglaw goes against pretty much everything I stand for morally, I want to help people, not slave away 80 hours a week for massive corporate clients. I also eventually want work life balance, which isn't achievable really in big law, so I'd be taking a big paycut after a year or two to go into something else. I likely won't apply no matter what this fall, so I would be doing at least 1 gap year between graduating undergrad and starting law school, not sure what I would do in that time period.

Med school: This is what I feel like I'd have more of a passion for, but it comes with serious financial pitfalls, I have spoken with my schools financial aid office and if I were to delay graduation to do all the premed classes I should still have most everything covered by financial aid, but this involves adding an extra year or two to my undergrad, and I would almost certainly be in more debt with med school than law school, This also means even once in med school it will take at least 7 years to become an attending with a good salary. Of course the financial upside to this is I can make a very high salary (barring any federal legislation which drastically cuts physician salaries), and I could actually help people. Unlike big law I could work as a doctor my entire career and earn biglaw level pay for my entire career.

I am not sure I'd be happy practicing law, med school is what I am leaning towards, but is this a terrible decision?",finance

investing,I’ve seen several post worries about a market crash- mostly new investors who are worried they bought the top. Here is one way to play a crash for whom it concerns,"1 almost all the time people are predicting the next crash 

2 know what your investing in~preferably a company you know and use that is steadily showing an increase in cash flow ~ a solid company then how the market moves shouldn’t matter. The price of the stock shouldn’t even matter. You own a part of a great company.

3 use the power of DCA ( dollar cost averaging) with this strategy you buy consistently every week - month - or day. This will minimize the effect of volatility on your portfolio. 

4 DIVIDENDS. often good established companies will pay you a portion of their profits. By reinvesting these you can grow your share count. Using ETFs like SCHD or JEPI create cash flow in your portfolio quarterly and monthly. When 
The market begins to fall you are all ready accumulating more shares at discount prices. These newly acquired shares will also pay you dividends creating a snowball effect. 

5 if you can add more than your dca purchases then save it as a cash or bond position In your portfolio. This will allow you to go on a spending spree when the market crashes to buy more of your shares you picked out in (see “2”).

6 recent US history 1973+ has shown that during market turn downs the fed will try and create an artificial floor under the market. You can benefit from this buy purchasing gold and silver or mining companies. This always works as an inflation play. Ray Dalio suggest to keep ~7% in precious metals. Another inflation play would be commodities such as oil or oil companies or lumber etc….

7 I do not suggest buying or using these. OPTIONS. You can sell calls or buy puts when expecting crashes. If I had to chose one I would sell COVERED calls and re buy them when the stock drops for a lower premium and reinvest the difference. With put options I think the risk is greater. I won’t go into detail here on what options are.

personalfinance,"I wanted to open a checking and savings account at the Alliant Credit Union, but my mother had other plans.","(18M)

**TLDR:** Alliant Online Credit Union is in the middle of reviewing my application for a checking account, and they required additional verification. I asked my mom for the forms I needed for verification. She explained that I already had an account with her bank, TD Bank, and that she wanted me to open a new one there. 

[In my last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/od73v2/i_want_to_open_a_bank_account_but_i_have_no_money/), I wanted to get my own bank account at the Alliant Credit Union, but I had no money for a minimum balance to open a savings account. 

After reading the comments, I decided I would just open a checking account at Alliant for now, and then open a savings account when I got my first paycheck. 

After submitting my application, I got an email stating that they wanted additional verification. They wanted the following.

* **One (1)** forms of valid U.S. government or state ID (at least one must be a Photo ID):
   * U.S. drivers license, state ID, signed passport, signed social security card, birth certificate, and/or permanent resident card.
* **One** (1) photocopy of your signed social security card.
* **One (1)** form of address verification
   * Utility bill, lease agreement, mortgage statement, vehicle registration card or voter registration 

I have the first one through my learner's permit, but my mother had the other two. I could've ordered my own through the mail, but I told my employer I would get them the materials I need to work as soon as possible. Plus, if I got it through the mail, one of my parents would probably find out somehow anyway. 

So I approached my mother for the remaining two, but she informed me that I already had my own account (I was unaware of this) she created at her own bank, TD Bank. She wanted me to open that account with her this weekend at the physical bank. 

I tried to explain that I had already signed up for an Alliant account and the high-interest rates that came with it, but she kept insisting I open that account with TD Bank. I didn't really have a choice, so I begrudgingly said okay. 

I really don't want to come across as ungrateful when talking about my parents (commenters who lack context have already accused me of this in other posts, not on this account), but I can't say I'm completely happy with the change of plans.

I chose Aliant because of the high interest rates on my checking and savings accounts, as well as the easy online access and the fact that it was a different bank than my parents'. I don't have a good relationship with my them (for other reasons), and I wanted to be financially independent. It would also help to avoid any inadvertent connections as well. 

I'm also apprehensive about opening a TD Bank account this weekend versus opening one through Alliant ASAP, but I'm not sure which option will take longer to acquire a direct deposit form, so it might not be a big concern.

Anyway, that's all.",finance

wallstreet,The Fed is quiet.,Have you ever wondered why the Fed has been mum about the rate?  Meanwhile the treasuries have shot up due to inflation data which the Fed said was transitory.  Perhaps Jackson Hole gathering will shed more light on what the bankers will do to steer the economy between inflation and recovery.  No matter what happens YOLO will be the common theme.👽,finance
personalfinance,Refinancing a car,"Hi everyone, I’m interested in refinancing my car but I’m unsure of how many months I want to refinance it for….. is there a way to see the different options months/ interest rate when applying for a loan? Or would I have to just chose a time frame and they will tell me the interest rates and months?",finance
personalfinance,Is it worth it for me to be paying above the minimum mortgage payment right now?,"So about a year ago I moved into my first home. My mortgage is a 15/1 ARM physician's loan with a decent interest rate (3.49%) for the first 15 years. Being a 15/1 the last 15 have a brand new interest rate, and I may refinance when that time comes depending on the market.

My mortgage payment is $2588. Starting in January I started paying an extra $500 toward the principle, which at this point would bring the life of the mortgage down to ~21 years. 

So, the question is this: Is this worth it, or am I better served putting that $500 per month towards something else such as savings or stocks? I've always thought that paying off a 30 year mortgage sooner rather than later was a good goal to have, but I've never actually had that challenged by people who actually know anything about personal financing.",finance
personalfinance,Question about refinancing a mortgage as a business owner,"Hi there.

I’m a small business owner.  I started my business two years ago, and I’m successful enough to pay my pre-existing mortgage.  However, my overall net income has dropped around 30%, and that’s for this year - my first full year was around a 60% drop.

Now the interest rates are down, but I’m hesitant to mess with things - since I can afford the somewhat low interest rate (3.75% I think?), but I’m not sure I can prove it, would it be worthwhile to try?  My bigger concern is that the bank could decide I’m not a good risk and pull something with the mortgage I am current on.",finance
CryptoCurrency,Found my old phone from 2013 that I used for weed purchased using Bitcoin,"As the title says. I was one of those guys that got into crypto early. As in 2010 ish. For quite some time, I made a living exclusively from trading Liberty Reserve. The OG's here know that story. The feds shut it down and I lost over $15,000. I scrounged what I had left and diversified my portfolio. E-gold, Bitcoin, digitalnaira and more.

Of all of them, Bitcoin had the least promise. Cos it was only used by bad guys on silk road. Which is where my dealer brought from, and was what I used to pay for weed instead of cash. 

November 2013, I decided to sell all my crypto and grow up and get a real job. The good news is I just now realized I had 10 bitcoins on my LocalBitcoins account. No longer have access to the email I used then, but have reached out to the team to see if my account can be restored.

Previously Covered but still interesting:

1. Manuel Chakravarty gave a big update on Hydra (layer 2 scaling). Hydra will not require that the base layer be modified since it will be implemented via Plutus smart contracts. Hydra is actually a collection of protocols including Hydra Head and Hydra Tail. Hydra Head is a symmetric protocol where multiple participants will be online simultaneously for the whole period of the head exchanging messages. Hydra Tail is an asymmetric protocol involving a high performance server and many clients that may be mobile and could be offline for large portions of the tail’s existence. There will also be “inter head &amp; tail networking” which will allow for a network of heads and tails. They have a published research paper on Hydra Head. They are currently writing the Hydra Tail paper.
2. Hydra is distinguished from other layer 2 protocols by its isomorphic properties. This means you will be able to run any smart contract that works on the base layer in a Hydra Head! This is very special. We won’t need special purpose contracts built out just for layer 2. There are some big implications to this. Since a Hydra Head is essentially just a Plutus smart contract, this means you can run a Hydra Head inside another Hydra Head. It’s turtles all the way down, guys. It sounds like they can do this iteratively as much as they want.
3. Aggelos also gave a good presentation on the importance of “skin in the game” in resource based consensus protocols (both proof-of-work and proof-of-stake) and its effect on promotion or discouragement of centralization. He explained how Ouroboros has built-in safeguards to prevent centralization including the K parameter (currently at 500) which caps total rewards per pool and the alpha parameter (currently at 0.3) which splits rewards into a 77% piece and a 23% piece. A pool can take its share of the 77% piece based on the pool’s total stake and its share of the 23% piece based on the pledge of the SPO. A higher alpha parameter makes it less attractive for individual SPOs to proliferate multiple pools since they can’t be as leveraged on their available pledge and still get as big a share of the 23% piece. This also discourages Sybil Attacks. As Cardano on-chain governance progresses, these parameters will be controlled by the community.
4. There will be a Cardano Goguen Summit in September. It will be hybrid digital/in-person.
5. Charles is helping to bring the cryptographer who broke SHA-1 to the University of Wyoming. The Cardano funded blockchain lab there could be on the road to be a powerhouse.

8. Professor Aggelos Kiayias recently dropped a video explaining exactly how Mithril (apparently neckbeard dungeon master talk for elf armor) is going to allow for Perfect Cardano (ADA) wallets that combine the ease of use and convenience of light wallets with the trustlessness of full node wallets. We also learned exactly how Mithril is going to work. [https://youtu.be/LhepJFCyWRk](https://youtu.be/LhepJFCyWRk)
9. In proof-of-work, bootstrapping can be done with blockheaders. This won’t do in proof-of-stake since we need information about stakeholder distribution to confirm block validity.
10. Mithril fixes this by being a cryptographic construction that enables a population of stakeholders to issue a signature consistent with certain constraints.
11. For Mithril to work in proof-of-stake, it needs three crucial properties: 1) it needs to enforce a threshold ratio of stakeholders before the signature is issued; 2) the pre-signature fragments must be independently verified and subject to public aggregation; and 3) it must be efficient in the sense that the final signature is of constant size and is logarithmically dependent on the # of stakeholders.
12. Stakeholders will issue special Mithril keys along with the normal cryptographic key material. Then at regular intervals, full nodes will test whether they can produce a pre-signature fragment. Only a random subset of stakeholders will be eligible to produce a pre-signature fragment. When a sufficient # of pre-signature fragments have been issued by eligible stakeholders then it will be possible to aggregate the fragments into a final signature.
13. This will be a checkpoint that will be verifiable with respect to previous check points all the way back to the genesis block. Such checkpoints will be cryptographic commitments of the relevant UTXOs.
14. Since the checkpoints will be trustless, a light client (i.e. wallet) will only need to verify the sequence of checkpoints up to the current time to trustlessly bootstrap.
15. The ecosystem is growing so fast, it’s hard to keep up with all the projects without these infographics at this point. [https://twitter.com/Dr\_shwetaPHD/status/1398783893638103040](https://twitter.com/Dr_shwetaPHD/status/1398783893638103040)

70. Bloomberg just published a piece called “America Should Become a Nation of Renters”. While this statement is probably extremely polarizing for Americans, it can also be argued that the death of homes as the primary investment vehicle of Americans may open up a new wave of adoption in crypto as an alternative.

74. It looks like the second biggest ETH stakepool or it's custody provider has lost it’s users private keys to $75MM in ETH. Cardano doesn’t have this problem. We get to keep custody of our crypto because we found a better way than slashing.

78. We saw segments on various newer partner entities like Nervos, Orion Protocol, and Revuto. Nervos is a UTXO proof-of-work blockchain which is building a cross-chain bridge with Cardano so that you can use your ADA on Nervos dApps and vice versa. Interoperability is a big theme for Nervos and they plan to have a working testnet within a month. Orion Protocol is building a terminal that will allow for decentralized non-custodial trading across centralized and decentralized exchanges. They say this would not require you to KYC or even have an account with any of these exchanges. Revuto is an online subscription management service that recently completed a $10MM token sale on Cardano.
79. It was also revealed that Wolfram Labs, COTI, and IOHK have a three-way partnership (a ménage à tech) to build an NFT auction site. The people from Wolfram were talking about very interesting things including live minting during streaming events and automated upload to IPFS. COTI will be building out auction and bidding mechanisms in ADAPay.
80. Professor Aggelos Kiayias gave us an update on research including that Ouroboros Chronos and Hydra papers have both been accepted into conferences/journals. Chronos will provide Cardano with a global concept of time that doesn’t rely on any outside timekeeper. Prof. Kiayias also pointed out that Hydra is distinguishable from other layer two protocols in that the scripting language is identical to that of the base layer in Cardano such that any dApp that can run on Cardano will run on the Hydra L2. This is a huge plus and superior to many other layer two solutions in other ecosystems where the base layer dApps will not run on layer two. Finally, the Mithril paper has been submitted for peer review. It will provide Cardano light wallets with Succinct Non-interactive Arguments of Knowledge that will give us the best of both worlds: no delays for syncing as in full node wallets while still preserving trustlessness.
81. Finally, the Goguen Summit will be in late September. Sign up now at [summit.cardano.org](http://summit.cardano.org/).
82. The Fed is once again STRONGLY signalling to us that they are going to regulate stablecoins. The Fed is also specifically calling out Tether for the first time.

83. People are starting to realize that the Stakehound private key loss in ETH may attract unwanted regulatory attention to Ethereum 2.0 while this problem could never have occurred in Cardano. Also, only a few days later another ETH stakepool (this time SharedStake...the sixth biggest ETH Stakepool) allegedly experiences a rugpull that some are valuing at over $30MM. This is another problem that could not happen in Cardano staking. It feels like we stepped into the ring, they rang the bell, and ETH just started punching itself in the head. Eventually it’s going to KO itself.

Banking,Return dispute advice? Please help!,"3 months ago I returned parts to Diesel Powered Products. I had contacted them about a return cause I got rid of the truck. Well, their return form never sent me an email back with return instructions. 

So, okay, fine. I'm going to ship it back out to DPP headquarters in Spokane, WA. Which is what I did. Waited two weeks, never got my money back. 

So, I called my bank, and filed a dispute. Gave them the details, and the information for shipping in which I returned the items. I'm covered under federal regulation (reg E), so I'm entitled to my money. 

The bank pays me, and they charge DPP back. DPP submits a rebuttal, which I have the paperwork for. The only thing DPP submitted for proof is email conversation about the return. That, and the invoice of the purchase. 

So somebody in Huntington decided that was enough proof to reverse my credit and give it back to the merchant. I'm floored.Im calling the bank tomorrow and informing them that per federal regulation, that I have submitted all proof, including the shipping information. 

I am no longer in possession of the parts, and that the merchant is responsible for this. I am over $300 in the negative because of this. 

I'm just not sure how far I'm going to get with this 🤷‍♂️",finance
CryptoCurrency,Inflation vs Deflation: Let's Talk,"This post is targeted towards people who are interested in exploring macroeconomics and discussions are strictly not limited to cryptocurrencies.

**Inflation** can be defined as a persistent rise in the general price of goods and services of common or daily use — such as clothing, food, fuel, transport, etc — which results in an increase in the cost of living.

**Deflation** can be defined as the opposite, where the prices of general goods and services in respect to the unit of currency decreases over time.

Even people with basic economic sense would tell you that **a little inflation is good for the economy** and the reasons stated for the same are:

1. **Inflation incentivises spending**: This is because the purchasing power of your money is degrading day by day, so the average Joe would rather spend it today and buy two loaf of breads for the same price rather than buying one loaf of bread tomorrow (as goods become more expensive). So inflation is beneficial for producers as consumers are forced to spend their wealth thus keeping the economy running. More spending equates to more aggregated demand. More demand, in turn, triggers more production to meet that demand. So ultimately more spending means more growth.
2. **Everyone has to constantly provide value to the society:** Storing wealth is extremely difficult. Everyday you don't earn, your past money is losing value irrespective of whether you spend it or not. This forces the individual to either try to constantly provide value (have a source of income)  or invest existing wealth in the market risking it in hopes of beating the inflation with the profits. Either way, the money is being put to work and is not just sitting there doing nothing.

**Deflation is considered bad** because it indicates a fall in demand of goods which means producers suffer hence people lose jobs, goods prices falls even more and a viscous cycle is created.

Economists use the above context as proof that a little inflation is better than deflation and that **more spending equals more more growth**.

The truth is they cannot be more wrong. To take a look at the opposite scenario we just have to turn our heads to the World War II era and the post World War economy. This is what was being fed by the governments to its citizens in the time of war:

*""The war was what caused economic recovery. With government war expenditure and conscription on the rise, aggregate expenditure soared while unemployment plummeted, so all countries involved in World War II had recovered because of their participation in the war.""*

This is such a ridiculous notion. We all know the consequence of war and what it did to the people across the World. People were employed to murder other people and that is what was defined as productivity and economic growth.

Once the war was over, governments set on the notion that the war spending fuels the economy were scared. They expected recessions and economic stagnation whereas what really happened was the polar opposite:

*""The U.S. government cut its spending by an astonishing 75% between 1944 and 1948, and it also removed most price controls for good measure. And yet, the U.S. economy witnessed an extraordinary boom during these years. The roughly 10 million men who were mobilised for the war came back home and were almost seamlessly absorbed into the labor force, as economic production boomed, flying in the face of all economic predictions and* ***utterly obliterating the ridiculous notion that the level of spending is what determines output in the economy.****""*

Furthermore, by taking away the means to save, **the government incentive to spend turns people to live from pay-check to pay-check.** Inflation takes away the ability to pass on wealth to the next generation and thus people stop thinking towards the future and concentrate on the present. *""****Most Americans are not saving enough to retire by the age of 65****."" -* [Source Article](https://longevity.stanford.edu/sightlines-financial-security-special-report-mobile/)

Even if I am wrong on all of the above, the biggest demerit of an inflationary economy is that it completely disregards rational agents/people.

**A rational human has three options in an inflationary economy**:

1. Spend all the money away.
2. Invest in the market by taking a risk that the profits would outperform inflation.
3. Transfer all wealth to a deflationary asset/currency.

Every rational human being would choose to store their wealth in a deflationary asset because it is the least risky way to preserve wealth and let it grow. This kind of creates a dual-economy inside an inflationary economy where rational citizens are moving their wealth from the inflationary state issued currency to a deflationary one. Meanwhile, financially illiterate and under privileged people don't know any better and choose to trust the only currency they have been exposed to: the state issued one. **This means the poor keep losing: their purchasing power, the ability to transfer wealth to their children and they also live pay-check to pay-check.**

**This is why in an inflationary economy the rich keep getting richer and the poor struggle to make ends meet.** Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk and many more have stored most their wealth in their company's stock which is a deflationary asset. Over time, the stock price of amazon and tesla would rise making them richer, whereas the businessman who is storing his/her wealth in dollars is losing value day by day and it would be near impossible for this naive businessman to ever acquire wealth close to that of these behemoths.

**In a deflationary economy, everyone would get richer over time.** The under privileged would get equal opportunities to get out of their economic situation even without significant financial literacy. Unnecessary spending would reduce which would force producers to provide real value to the consumer to take their money. Eg: No more over-priced popcorn at the theatres. The consumer would be interested in delayed gratification and would be able to pass on wealth to his/her children thus breaking the poverty cycle.

**Deflationary economy breaks the dual-economy paradox and thus making the World a better place.**

Some even estimate that World Wars never happened before the 20th century because for the majority of the 19th century we were on a gold standard. When the governments started breaking away from the gold standard and inflated their money supply, they could drag out the war for years essentially converting it into World War which had never happened before.

I would like to credit the book ""The Bitcoin Standard"" for helping me understand the value of sound money. Some excerpts are taken from there to support my narrative.

&amp;#x200B;

Tl;dr - More spending doesn't equal more economic growth. Inflation turns people to live from pay-check to pay-check. The rich get richer and the poor get poorer. In a deflationary economy, everyone would get richer over time and people would be able to pass on their wealth to children thus breaking the poverty cycle.",cryptocurrency

Problem is after they made the hard inquiry construction team updated the mortgage loan consultant that my closing date is going to be pushed to December due to some material shortage.

Question: there could be another hard inquiry in the month of October or November for my actual
Closing date. That will be my third hard inquiry by the same lender and will it impact my overall credit score much for these frequent hard inquiries? Will it impact my interest rates and such?


Also I can’t shop for mortgages within next 14 days as I am not closing anytime soon or can i?

$IRON is a partially collateralised mechanism so it uses $USDC and $TITAN which is the secondary token created within the system. Every $IRON is valued at one dollar. It could be like 70% $USDC and 30% backed by the value of $TITAN.

$TITAN helps to support the price of $IRON and this 70-30 split is calculated based on an effective collateral ratio and is recalculated based on demand and supply. The end goal of this entire mechanism is to figure out the monetary policy to support $IRON as a stablecoin.

# IRON VS FRAX

We want discuss about $FRAX because we did a [big report](https://econteric.com/stablecoin/algo) on stablecoins together with Lemniscap and Bocconi university where we analysed eight different algo stablecoins.

&gt;Based on our matrix and all the different conclusions we came up with, $[FRAX](https://econteric.com/stablecoin/algo) was the most robust of all algo stablecoins. You can read the full report for free on [econteric.com/reports](https://econteric.com/reports).

$FRAX was the main protocol that created this design, then $IRON came along which was basically a copy of that but was built on a different chain. They built it on BSC and the Polygon network.

## If They Are The Same Then Why Did $FRAX Succeed Whereas IRON Failed?

The similarity is that both $FRAX and $IRON use partial collateral or partial reserve and both have the same reserve which is $USDC.

The key difference is that with $FRAX the base mechanism is the same but it moved on to create version 2 and updated the system to make it more robust and efficient, **which $IRON did not do.** They stayed on V1.

&gt;Great concept, great idea, but poor design.

CryptoCurrency,Will there be fee less exchanges in the future?,"When you read this, bare in mind that in my country the banks are close to fee less. I don't pay fees to pay bills, using atm (not even abroad), to transfer money to someone else (or exchanges for that matter). When getting a loan for my house, then yes there was a fee. Other than that I can't remember paying fees in twenty years for just normal bank services.

So my question is, will there ever be a no fee exchange? I'm wondering because some of the fees are ridiculous. And gemini is something I consider just for the ten free transactions a month. I just need to look more into them first. 

Look at binance. All the staking that's being done through them. They must make a lot of money on just that. Why do the fees?

I remember when the first bank here became fee less. They were a fully online bank. So saving a lot of money on not having physical bank terminals across the country. But one office to deal with customers. Not only did they have no fees. They also gave best interest rate. I started using them. My old bank gave me my interest at the end of the year. While this one every month. Also this bank had lowest interest on loans. Today this bank is still thriving and the most popular among the customers. Other banks have followed. No more fees.

When can this kind of change happen in the crypto world? Binance having customers world wide. Earning on fees must be a huge huge huge income for them. They have this little easy service, a small amount of crypto worth less than $10? You can easily have that converted to BNB by one simple click. And even then they take their share. Their own coin. Which will benefit them either way.

People here say they hate banks who rob them through fees. Another system in the banks is already in play some places. In my situation for twenty years already. For the first time I feel robbed. By entering crypto world. It's insane to look at.

And I'm very very very sure that exchanges should be able to make cuts and make it cheaper for us. The question is when. And how to push them in that direction...?",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Relo-Tax Gross Up &amp; Roth Eligibility Question,"Hi All,
I’ve seen answers for similar questions but not quite this situation. I was hoping someone could chime in.

- Previously I calculated myself and my wife would make below the 2021 Roth IRA eligibility requirement to qualify after standard deductions (401k, HSA, etc.). As such we already made our $6k Roth contributions. 

The curveball is that my employer paid for a relocation this year with the typical gross up scheme, which is great but has caused a headache. I received a $3k grossed up cash payment + have also been receiving paystubs that have a gross payment for other relo expenses (goods shipment, etc) with taxes already paid &amp; resulting in zero net payment, but with a fed gross increase. It’s been tough to pre-estimate these and they’ve now grown to a significant figure over $20k. 

With this included we will be real tight/possibly over the Roth limit even with maxing out 401k/HSA and I need to figure out a solution. Two questions:
1. Confirming the grosses up relo payments as described above will impact my AGI? It looks to me it will &amp; will result in Roth ineligibity for this year. 
2. Confirming the best course of action should be to covert our Roth IRA contributions for this year to traditional then back door later to avoid penalties? Any other recommendations?",finance
investing,Hedging an income portfolio with growth stocks,"My portfolio has taken a bit of a burn lately. I'm primarily an income investor, focusing on stable companies that either pay dividend or have stable profits and free cash flow. I use options to either enhance this income or hedge my positions, depending on the situation. As of late, income stocks have taken a bit of a hit from what is supposed to be prolonged periods of low interest rates and quantitative easing, so I think companies sitting on cash are underperforming and those with higher growth potential are outperforming. But I could be wrong (check me on this one).

I'm looking to diversify my holdings to growth areas in the S&amp;P 500, so my options are either QQQ, XLK, or one of the ARK funds like ARKK or AWKW.

personalfinance,How to invest from an unstable country to gain economical freedom?,"I'm living in Turkey and things have been on a downhill economically and politically. The social aspect of the corruption also influences businesses, banks and even the law system. What this means is, local exchanges, banks or businesses are robbing their clients and they are getting away with it. At this point there is a biannual event of a businessman emptying their bank/exchange/business accounts and fleeing abroad. Problem is, nobody will return your lost money to you because corruption isn't just in the private field, it has spread to the private field from the government itself.  

Anyway I hope that paints a clear picture as to why I don't want to store anything that depends on my country's political or economical decisions.  

As a result I want to drive growth from outside sources. This way, political shenanigans of my country wouldn't affect me as much as somebody only earning TRY and investing in local assets.

I currently have more than half of my wealth in real estate, which I will be slowly shrinking until it is down to 50%. Taking that into account, what I had in mind for the remaining 50% is this:

* 20% Crypto, Planning to DCA into BTC, ETH and 2 Altcoins over the next year.
* 15% Foreign stocks, now I'm not from USA as a result I'm not sure how it works but I've found exchanges that aren't local that would allow me to purchase S&amp;P 500, or some way to drive dividend income, so this is a possibility. I can also divide this % within itself once I know what multiple stocks or index funds to invest into.
* 10% TRY interest account, this aside from real estate is the only local investment I'm comfortable with making as it takes advantage of the insane interest rates that banks provide (18%-20% as of today) while being protected against bankruptcy/cyberattacks at the given percentage, therefore anything above 10% would be a massive risk.
* 5% Cash/non interest fiat, I need liquidity to live

I would very much appreciate your opinions on how the general division of my portfolio looks like. Whether you think it would provide me the economical freedom from my country's downsides or am I clutching at straws and it's actually not possible?

Also please feel free to mention anything you think could benefit a portfolio like this for the general aims of growth over conservation and as much income and stability from outside Turkey in order to balance out how unstable Turkish economy is and how much value its currency is losing.

I've applied to anything and everything with no luck for 4 years, and I think it's because my grad program did not offer any type of TAing, so I don't have experience teaching in academia and it's also incredibly competitive. I teach painting workshops and show and sell my work, but it's not enough to really save money yet. Everything I make goes into rent, car insurance l, car payment, bills etc. I'm starting to feel fed up with the art world in general. I do well sometimes with my paintings and I have my first solo show this year, but I'm squeezing in painting time after jobs I don't like.

personalfinance,Refinance to 15 year?,"Hi all--

I refinanced through Better last year to a 30 year 2.875% loan  (216,000 remaining).  I've been paying an extra $350 a month to reduce the principal a bit more. 

Looks like better has a 2,000 AMEX credit promotion that might make it worth it to refinance again, but I'm not sure.  Loan Cabin is offering a 20 year loan at 2.25% with $974 paid in points or 15 year at 2% with $659 in points.  Better can match either of these, plus add the $2,000 credit which would cover the fees and such (I believe).  

My question is:  1)  Is it worth it to refinance?     and      2)  Since the interest rates are so low, is it better to have a house paid off sooner, or keep the mortgage for a long period of time due to inflation?  (I'm a teacher and have no plan to leave this house)

Thanks in advance.",finance
retirement,To Carry a Mortgage or Not?,"I'm 2 years away from retiring from my FT job. We think we're in good financial shape. We have a mortgage of about $250k with 10 years left (of 15 years) at 2.75 interest rate ... and no other significant loans or debt. The house is worth about $550k. We're planning on moving to a new location and the house prices are about the same if not a little bit more. We have $370k in accessible funds and then have $1.4 in IRA funds. We plan to live off both of these at least until we start taking SS (6 years.)

My wife and I have a disagreement. She believes that when we buy the new house, we should add our cash to the proceeds and therefore, have no mortgage. She would like us to have lower monthly expenses. 

I see that we make between 8% and 18% on both sets of money (we're at 13% halfway through this year!) With mortgage rates so low, I would like to have approximately the same mortgage and preserve the cash and preserve the 401k so we can continue to let it grow.

personalfinance,Refinancing for someone who's too worried to do so,"I need some information regarding refinancing. My partner is American and has a mortgage on a house with Bank of America for 7%. I'm European and don't understand much of the fine print and terms of the mortgages here (I do, however, in my country). I'm slowly reading up on how personal finance works in the USA - it's so different here.Anyway, I've asked my partner to please refinance as the interest rates are so low at the moment and he's been so hesitant plainly out of fear of being screwed over by any of the banks or mortgage places.

He's already called Bank of America to ask for a lower interest rate, but they waved him off because of XYZ reasons... (one of them being that his credit score wouldn't be the best - which is a lie, his credit score is at 750 rn; the paperwork would be difficult to obtain for him; they can't help him with this yadda yadda yadda). Now looking at more posts in this sub regarding refinancing I can see why they did that - 7% is an awesome rate for them.

He's looked into Rocket Mortgage and has an offer from them - closing cost would be around $5,000 which I find a lot. For my partner it's important he lowers his monthly rate - it's at around $750 at the moment per month and he wants to go down to around $400-$450 a month. Rocket Mortgage could do that for 30 years at 2,75%.

However, doing all the math, it would be that Rocket Mortgage would be more expensive over the 30 years than Bank of America with around 15 years left.

I've been begging him to just look around at other offers, but he's just too worried to do so because of 1. he might get screwed over any fine print he doesn't understand and 2. he's scared that if he asks more places his credit score will go down because of too many banks looking into his credit score.

&amp;#x200B;

So here are my questions:

1. What can I do to help him get his worries of his mind? I just think 7% is too much for mortgage on a house and would love him to get a better deal with less interest and less closing costs.
2. Are there places with no closing costs?
3. Is it true that it lowers your credit score if too many banks look into it?
4. What would you do in his case?
5. Where can I read up on all the details on what to look out for in mortgages?

I hope I covered all the details. If I missed anything, I can edit the post. Any other ideas you might have - I would highly appreciate it.",finance
personalfinance,Home Sale / 121 exemption / unrecaptured section 1250 gain,"Hello,

I am trying to figure out my tax situation with my primary residence and would hope that my situation is challenging enough for some of you to contribute. Thank you in advance. 

My wife and I purchased our home in 2004 and plan on selling it in 2025. At that point I will qualify for the 121 exemption since I will have owned it for more than 5 years and will have used it as my primary residence for the last 2 years before selling the home. During the 21 years that I will have owned the home, I will have worked for 8 years outside of the US. Still working for the same employer, but on International project assignment. During these 8 years the home was rented out. I expect that the gain from selling our home in 2025 will be below 500k (filing jointly).

After researching this topic to the best of my ability, it appears that I qualify for the 121 exemption, but that I will have to pay taxes on the deprecation for the 8 years the property has been rented out. But I was not able to get that confirmed or to calculate what the amount of taxes would be. In case its relevant, during the 8 years outside the US, I continued to pay US state and federal income tax.

stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Friday, July 9, 2021. Please enjoy!","**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, July 9, 2021**

The stock market pulled a remarkable turnaround today, shaking off yesterday’s declines with the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) rocketing to another record intraday high, led by the financial and energy sectors, which had been lagging as of late and continued strength in mega-cap tech stocks. It seems that after a brief flare-up of concerns regarding the coronavirus delta variant and a potential acceleration of the timeline to taper quantitative easing in the US, fears have greatly tempered. At the time of writing, the Dow Jones (DIA) rose 1.27% while the Nasdaq (QQQ) rose 0.6% and is very slightly below it’s all-time high. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, led the day, rising more than 2%.

In recent weeks, market participants are increasingly trying to gauge if the surge we are seeing in the more contagious coronavirus delta variant will weigh on global growth rates. Yesterday, it seems concerns came to a head after the Japanese government made a last minute announcement that a state of emergency would be re-instituted across Tokyo and that all events would take place behind closed doors, with no spectators, walking back an earlier decision to allow locals to attend the games. The state of emergency will begin on Monday and run through Aug. 22, while the games are scheduled from July 23 to Aug. 8. On Wednesday, 16 days before the Opening Ceremony, the [Tokyo Metropolitan Government reported 920 COVID cases](https://stopcovid19.metro.tokyo.lg.jp/en), over 200 more than any other single-day total since May. On Thursday, it reported 896, the second-highest count since May. Other countries, like India and Brazil, are also dealing with an extremely worrying surge of cases. Even in the US, where roughly 50% of those eligible are fully vaccinated, the country is seeing a small surge in cases recently, with the delta variant accounting for 51.7% of all new infections, according to the CDC. According to reports, as of yesterday, only 16.8% of the Japanese population was vaccinated against the virus. 

In other news, in another move that raised concerns about the global growth rate, China’s central bank signalled it will be cutting the amount of cash that banks must hold in reserve, a move that suggests the economic recovery in China may be slowing down. The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) will reduce the reserve requirement ratio by 0.5 percentage points for most banks, according to a [statement](http://www.pbc.gov.cn/goutongjiaoliu/113456/113469/4287599/index.html) published Friday. That will unleash about 1 trillion yuan ($154 billion) of long-term liquidity into the economy and will be effective on July 15, the central bank said. The reduction was signaled earlier this week, when the State Council, China’s equivalent of a cabinet, hinted the central bank would make more liquidity available to banks so they could lend to smaller firms hurt by rising costs. The timing and magnitude of the move, coming a week before second-quarter growth data, suggests worries about the economy’s outlook and was a decisive shift away from policy tightening, which most, if not all, recovering economies are pursuing.

Ken Cheung, Chief Asian Foreign Exchange Strategist at Mizuho, said “The PBOC came in broader and sooner than expected, highlighting the policy urgency to support the Chinese economy. Such firm easing measures could further fuel concern over China’s growth outlook in the second half as well as the upcoming Q2 GDP figures in the coming week”. Just to put into more familiar terms, this would be like if the Federal Reserve suddenly turned around and said rather than discussing tapering quantitative easing, it would instead propose pumping more money into the economy.

While these global concerns did jitter the market yesterday, the impressive recovery in US equities underscores the remarkable strength of its economy, as the country continues reopening thanks to effective distribution of the vaccine, with 48% of the population fully vaccinated, according to the CDC. In my opinion, while the delta variant does pose a risk to global growth rates, and the market may react negatively to headlines about it, the foundations of the recovery in the US (i.e nation-wide reopening measures, a rapidly improving labor market, record earnings from companies, and a high level of savings among Americans) are very strong and will continue to underpin a bull market here. 

**Highlights** 

* The recent sell-off in crude oil recovered, with the West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures settling higher by 2.2% to $74.56 per barrel at the time of writing.
* Apple (AAPL), the largest company in the world, reached a new all-time high today. 
* President Biden is expected to sign an executive agreement ordering the Federal Trade Commission to limit or ban noncompete agreements, unnecessary occupational licenses, and revise guidance for sharing wage information between the HR department and workers and other employers. 
* Tesla (TSLA), Brookfield Asset Management (BAM) said Friday they would work together on a new initiative to create the nation's most sustainable residential community. The companies said the provisionally named SunHouse at Easton Park in Austin, Texas, would be the first Tesla Solar neighborhood.
* On Monday, a trial will kick off in the Court of Chancery in Wilmington, Delaware between Elon Musk and shareholders. The plaintiffs alleged that Musk used his control at Tesla to force the company to buy SolarCity for $2.6 billion in order to protect his investment in the company from bankruptcy and want Musk to pay that money back to Tesla. IMO seems a little weird to me to sue about this given that SolarCity has proven to be a good acquisition for Tesla.
* Apple (AAPL) is reportedly in early talks with the NFL to buy the rights to stream Sunday Night games for their streaming service. A while ago, Amazon (AMZN) bought the right to stream Thursday NFL games for Prime Video.

personalfinance,Building a new house: Best use of funds?,"My parents have bought 30 acres of rural land. Utilities are already present at the road. We are getting the land replatted so my brother in law and I can each own 1.5 acres. My parents are going to sell the land to me at what they paid for it, that plus the replatting fees should come out to a little under $30,000.

We have been talking to a home builder and have been discussing building a ~1350 square foot 3 bed 1.5 bath single story, still haven’t nailed down a price but I expect it’s going to come in somewhat over $200k. So possibly around $250k total or so, including the land. 

As for our finances, I make $2300/month after taxes, my wife makes $1000/month. We have a $20k emergency fund and $70k to put towards the house with an additional ~$130k invested in an IRA, 401k and non-tax advantaged accounts. The land and platting fees will be paid to my father in a month or two, but I’m not see what to do about the rest. 

With interest rates being as low as they are, is it better to only put a small amount down? Or put more down and have a smaller monthly payment?

Since we are building new, what can we do to lower bills and avoid future expenses? We are looking at a metal roof for durability, and aligning our house to have a southern facing roof for solar. We are in NE Texas and intend to live in this house permanently. Is there any other information that would help to provide?",finance

I'm starting a new job and have 2 loans to pay off, student loans at $22k, and a mortgage, with a total principal = $311k.

Because I'm a first-time homebuyer, I have to pay PMI, which comes out to about $180/mo for every month that my principal remaining is over 80%. I have several components to my student loan, and the average interest rate for each component is 4.5%. My mortgage has a 3.25% interest rate.

How would I go about deciding which loan to prioritize in paying back first, in order to minimize total cost? Are there any good online calculators for this problem? Although my student loans have a higher interest rate, and the total quantity to pay back is smaller, PMI is a waste and doesn't contribute anything towards my mortgage principal, so would it be cheaper to attack the mortgage loan first? Would appreciate an answer that includes mathematical support, or a resource that could help solve this problem.

EDIT: down payment is $14k, total value of house is $325k. So, once I have $65k equity, PMI disappears.",finance
stocks,"Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning July 12th, 2021","Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning July 12th, 2021.

# **Earnings season begins in the week ahead with eye-popping growth set to validate market’s 2021 run - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/09/earnings-season-begins-in-the-week-ahead-with-eye-popping-growth-set-to-validate-markets-2021-run.html)**
*****
&gt; Second-quarter earnings reporting season gets underway in the week ahead and eye-popping results could validate a market that continues to easily shake off any concerns on its steady march to record high after record high.
*****
&gt; The second quarter’s profits for S&amp;P 500 companies are expected to be up 65% from the same quarter a year ago in the depths of the pandemic, according to Refinitiv. The growth will be led by a near 570% increase in profits for industrials, one of the hardest hit sectors during the pandemic.
*****
&gt; “The second quarter could be as good as it gets for economic growth,” said Callie Bost, senior investment strategist at Ally Invest. “Earnings growth may slow, but analysts still expect S&amp;P profits to grow by double digits in the next two quarters. It’s crucial not to lose faith in the market just because the economy’s strongest growth may be behind us.”
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 climbed to yet another record on Friday following a minor setback on Thursday. Banks and other stocks linked to an economic comeback led the way. With Friday’s gain, the benchmark posted a 0.4% gain for the week and its sixth positive week in seven, bringing its 2021 gains to over 16%.
*****
&gt; The financial sector starts the earnings season off with reports from JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs Tuesday. Bank of America, Citigroup and Wells Fargo report Wednesday, and Morgan Stanley and Truist report Thursday.
*****
&gt; The banking industry is expected to produce blowout results for the second quarter with S&amp;P 500 financial sector earnings doubling year over year, according to Refinitiv. Major banks recently announced they will boost their dividend payouts after the Federal Reserve gave lenders a thumbs-up as all 23 passed the central bank’s stress test.
*****
&gt; Bank stocks led Thursday’s sell-off on Wall Street as some investors took bets off in the face of a surprising drop in Treasury yields. They then immediately snapped back Friday. Strong earnings result could help stabilize the sector that gyrated amid intensifying worries about slowing growth.
*****
&gt; # Big earnings numbers ahead
Among other sectors, consumer discretionary companies are also expected to see a big profit comeback, with earnings up 271%, according to Refinitiv. Energy companies are expected to see earnings bounce back by 225%, and materials are expected to see earnings growth of 115%. Tech lags those sectors with just a 31.6% gain. Utilities are expected to see earnings decline by 0.9%.
*****
&gt; “Once you pass the peak of economic growth as well as earnings growth, you do get higher levels of volatility,” said Matt Stucky, portfolio manager, equities, at Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management Co. “We still think the path of least resistance is higher when it comes to equities but with more volatility than we’ve had.”
*****
&gt; He said he expects stocks to continue to make gains but to grow at a much more normal level. “There’s fundamental reasons to be optimistic about the market in the next year,” said Stucky. He said earnings should be strong and companies that can pass along higher costs will raise prices.
*****
&gt; # Inflation
There is also some important data ahead, particularly the Consumer Price Index on Tuesday. CPI inflation rose at a higher than expected annual rate of 5% in May, and June could also be hot. The Fed has said it would allow inflation to rise above its targeted 2% level, and watch an average inflation rate.
*****
&gt; “I think all of the inflation prints are going to take on added importance,” said Jim Caron, head of global macro strategy at Morgan Stanley Investment Management. “It’s not a question of whether it will fall. It’s whether it will fall fast enough to make the Fed remain patient. If it’s just lingering around a high level, that’s not good.”
*****
&gt; All eyes will be on the 10-year Treasury yield’s reaction to the data given the equity market took its cues from the bond market for most of the past week. As the 10-year yield dove to 1.25% on Thursday, the lowest since February, the equity market dropped, believing bond investors were signaling an economic global slowdown could be ahead. As yields snapped back on Friday, so did equity markets.
*****
&gt; Other data includes Producer Price Index Wednesday and retail sales for June on Friday.

&gt; # Stocks Are Going Streaking

&gt; To quote the great Frank the Tank from Old School, “We’re going streaking!” Although Frank had another idea, stocks have been streaking in some historic ways, both near-term and longer-term.

&gt; Let’s start with the more recent action. The S&amp;P 500 Index was recently higher seven consecutive days for the first time since last August, but even more impressive is it made new highs all seven of those days. You have to go back to June 1997 to find the last time we saw a streak like that! Incredibly, this has happened only eight other times since 1950 and stocks were higher a year later every single time.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/7.7.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Stocks have also streaked to monthly gains for five consecutive months. “Although a five month win streak for the S&amp;P 500 feels like a lot,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick, “a year later stocks were higher 25 out of 26 times after such long monthly win streaks. So the real strength could only be beginning.”

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, five month win streaks tend to be followed by strong performance over the next 12 months.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/7.7.21-Blog-Chart-3.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Lastly, the S&amp;P 500 has streaked to five consecutive quarterly gains. Some more color on this:

&gt; * The average return a year later has been only 6.6% because of very poor returns during the Great Financial Crisis. The median return a year later, though, is a solid 10.4%.

&gt; * The last time it was up five straight quarters was in the fourth quarter of 2016, when it went on to gain nine consecutive quarters.

&gt; * One year after that streak of five quarters stocks managed to gain more than 19% a year later.

&gt; * It has gained more than 5% for five consecutive quarters. Only from Q4 1953 through Q4 1954 did that last happen and stocks gained another 26% the following year.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/7.7.21-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; There is no doubt that stocks have put up some amazing streaks lately and history would suggest the path of least resistance remains higher. We listed some potential near-term worries in Three Things That Worry Us, but bigger picture going out a year or so, this bull market looks alive and well and these recent streaks do little to change that.

*****

&gt; # Mega Cap Stocks Relatively Strong

&gt; Mega cap stocks are an important area to watch and have been an area of our focus recently as the relatively small number of names hold a large weight within the S&amp;P 500. Their recent strength has propelled the broad market to a series of new highs in spite of what has been weaker breadth outside of this space.

&gt; In the chart below, we take a closer look at the relative performance of the four largest stocks versus the S&amp;P 500 over the past year. Alphabet (GOOGL) has performed the best versus the S&amp;P 500 of the four names shown and is at one-year highs. Apple (AAPL) outperformed the S&amp;P significantly in 2020 but gave it all back from late January through May. Since June, however, Apple has been on a tear versus the market. Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon (AMZN) are both still underperforming the S&amp;P over the last twelve months, but they have made solid moves higher since June.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/07/070721-Mega-Caps1.png))**

*****

&gt; # Value (VLUE) Giving Way To Quality (QUAL)

&gt; In last night's Closer, we noted how until February the Momentum factor (MTUM) was keeping up with Value (VLUE), but it has since given up ground as VLUE, even after stumbling of late, remains the clear top performer of the four factor-based ETFs from MSCI. On a total return basis, VLUE has gained 45.42% over the past year which is roughly 7 percentage points more than the next best performer: the Quality ETF (QUAL). Granted, that return was even stronger at 51.49% at the high on June 4th. With VLUE's outperformance having wavered over the past month, QUAL has been gaining ground. Additionally, although QUAL has underperformed, alongside Minimum Volatility (USVM) there has been a much less 'exciting' and steady grind higher than VLUE or Momentum (MTUM).

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/07/070721-Value-vs-Growth.png))**

&gt; # Diverging Breadth and Frothy Sentiment

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/a734b9d2b4777766bd113a28906be098/89796090ee48d63e-e2/s500x750/d6b685fd5371e36c3cb35b75d0907fd4f5a9f09a.jpg))**

&gt; Today’s selloff did not catch the Advance/Decline Line off guard. As you can see in the chart above, as the S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ logged minor new highs yesterday and DJIA did last Friday, market breadth has been diverging. NYSE Composite and S&amp;P 500 breadth have flat-lined over the past week while Russell 2000 and NASDAQ breadth turned clearly lower. This indicates a market running out of gas as advancing issues are unable to outpace decliners and in the case of the NAS and R2K decliners have been beating out advancers over the past week.

&gt; This bad breadth scenario comes at the outset of the seasonally weakest time of the year from mid-July through October – AKA the “Worst Four Months.” In addition, bullish sentiment had reached dangerous levels in the face of a dearth of bears. The chart below courtesy of the venerable Investors Intelligence U.S. Advisors Sentiment Report shows the difference of the Bullish Advisors % less the Bearish Advisors %. When this gets above 40 it’s a warning sign and with 60.8% Bulls and 15.5% bears the difference is now 45.3%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/713d20e83eb1f1b1223cebead8093162/89796090ee48d63e-f9/s500x750/44da67099273196331f448ae52d69bf3bd3f537d.jpg))**

&gt; The weekly CBOE Equity-Only Put/Call ratio tracked in Barron’s “Market Lab that we have followed for years, has also reached extremely complacent levels lately. Put/Call retreated from the modest fear level of 0.59 at the May lows back down to 0.41 the first two weeks of June and logging 0.43 and 0.44 the past two weeks. We have been getting defensive and in a neutral posture since our April 22 Best Six Months Seasonal MACD Sell Signal for S&amp;P 500 and DJIA and have been preparing for our MACD Sell Signal for NASDAQ’s Best 8 Months which appears imminent.

*****

&gt; # Value Has Given Up The Ghost

&gt; In the last few months of 2020 and throughout 2021, the S&amp;P 500 Value ETF (IVE) was consistently outperforming its growth counterpart (IVW). Since its most recent high in early June, though, IVE has given up the ghost falling 2.5%. Although not a dramatic decline, IVE's drop has coincided with a rally of 7.3% in IVW and an even larger 12.5% rally off the May 12th lows.

&gt; With growth having gained so much ground on value, on Tuesday, IVW's year-to-date performance actually moved above that of IVE. That has continued to be the case through the rest of the week as IVW is currently outperforming IVE on a year-to-date basis by almost a full percentage point. Additionally, looking at the past year's relative strength between the two ETFs, the recent divergence in performance has resulted in relative strength reverting back to zero meaning growth and value have roughly performed in line with one another over the one year span.

&gt; # Russell 2,000 (IWM) No Longer in Favor in Q2

&gt; The final quarter of 2020 and the first quarter of this year saw small caps come back into favor as the Russell 2,000 consistently outperformed the S&amp;P 500 during that stretch. From the late September test of its 200-DMA to the mid-March highs, the Russell 2,000 rose rallied around 65% versus the S&amp;P 500's gain which was less than half of that. As such, the ratio of the two indices shown below, and highlighted in last night's Closer, ripped higher. That outperformance has been absent over the past quarter though. In the second half of March, the ratio peaked then made a sharp reversal lower. Throughout Q2 and continuing into Q3, the ratio has continued to trend lower as the Russell 2,000 has trended sideways, hovering around its 50-DMA.

personalfinance,11% interest rate on student loans,"EDIT: My S/O and I did the math for every possibility and came to the conclusion that I will need to just keep paying the second payment on my student loans each month and keep my 401k to roll over into an IRA. So, if anyone has any ideas on how to bring the interest rate down or where I refi without a degree, that would be great.  


Hi everyone. I am a 24 y/o with about $20k in a 401k and $17k in student debt with an 11% variable interest rate through Sallie Mae. I've looked into refinancing my student loans but most places require a Bachelor's degree (which I do not have, and will not have for several years - if ever). I've been paying double the minimum amount split between two payments in a month to reduce my loans at an accelerated rate but I'm hardly seeing any movement. I'm wondering if it would be better just to wipe out my student debt with my retirement and start over with a roth IRA with my new employer.

I guess I have a couple of questions here:

1. Would it be a good idea to wipe out my student loans with my current retirement and start maxing out my Roth with this new found money?
2. What kind of taxes/fines/fees am I looking to pay should I do this?
3. Do I have other options of refinancing my loans or paying them off earlier?
4. (ETA) Should I instead roll it over into a traditional or roth IRA with my new employer?

Thanks in advance!",finance

What will the next five years bring? Will we see adoption in the billions? Will there be even more innovative products beyond NFTs?",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,"Car gets totaled(Drive-able condition) not at-fault , need some advice on how to handle the situation financially.","Hello there! hope you guys are doing alright during this pandemic. For me, I'm somewhat in a pickle right now regarding my ride being totaled 4 weeks ago. I'll try to be specific as much as I can with my financial dilemma so please bear with me.

I'll start with my car, I'm currently driving a pre-owned 2014 Corolla, financed it for $21k with 12.8% interest, No Gap insurance. Current odo is 83k kilometers, good condition, regularly maintained. I have this car for about 4 years now, and with balanced of $8k, it wouldn't take another year for it to be fully paid. However, about 4 weeks ago, the fate of my car was sealed by an accident, I got rear-ended while waiting at the stop light and the impact causes me to hit another car right in front of me.

Luckily the car is still drive-able, however the rear bumper, trunk, taillights, front bumper we're affected by the crash, leaving me with a $10k worth of damage. The insurance company states that it's a total loss, and they offered me $13,100 which is not bad considering that in car-value calculating sites like Kelly blue books, my car goes only for $12k.

   They also told me that I can buy the car back If I wanted for $3,800, however I need to get the car fixed and ensure that it passes the mechanical inspection. Downside is, its going to be a rebuilt-title and if I ever get into an accident again, the insurance company will most likely low-ball me with their offers because of the said title. 

 I've done some research these past few weeks, and some what came with some conclusions that hopefully, makes some sense. I'll put my car, financial status and divide my options into 3 so its much easier to read. 

&amp;#x200B;

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\*My financial background and current car loan\*

Financial status: stable, salary is 45k a year, sick of my job though!

Credit score: 719, good credit

Line of credit: none at the moment but doable

Car financed: $21k with 12.8% interest. no GAP insurance, 5 years of payment, zero down

Balanced left in my car loan: $8k 

Money after paying balance: $5,100

&amp;#x200B;

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\* Car Total loss\*

Insurance company offer for the car: $13,100

Buy-back offer: $3,800

Total damage/ fix: $10k or more

&amp;#x200B;

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Option 1: Financed a certified pre-owned car 

pros

\- Lower interest rate than my previous loan which is 12.8%( this is due to my financial problems 5 years ago) 

\- GAP insurance for added security in case of total loss

\- Credit history 

\- Good looking 2019 Corolla hatchback 

\- down payment of 20% about $4k 

Cons 

\- Another 5 years of excruciating payments

\- Future is bleak, don't know if I will still be employed by then.

&amp;#x200B;

Option 2: Buy-Back

Pros

\- 1 more year left to pay the last 8k( I can even rush the payment now)

\-  financially free in terms of car payments

\- can probably find a new job without being bothered by car payments

Cons 

\- Will have to get it fixed with my own money which probably isn't enough

\-  Rebuilt-title, low-ball offers the next time I get into an accident

&amp;#x200B;

Option 3: Buy a used car from advertising company like Craigslist

pros

\- Can buy a car within $5k range

\- freedom from getting a new loan

\- can probably find a new job without being bothered by car payments

Cons

\- not a mechanic so cant tell if the car is reliable

\- high mileage 

\- cant be returned once bought from person

&amp;#x200B;

Hopefully this format isn't irritating enough,  and is legal to be use on this sub. I hope to get some of your opinions, or maybe your experiences about dealing with this kind of problem. Thanks in advance!",finance

cardano,"Cardano Rumor Rundown July 10, 2021","Hey Everyone!

Let's go...

Newly covered today: 

1. Cardano Gainz Calculator now has a graph showing 10 year growth. [https://twitter.com/lesquive1/status/1413249312465866757](https://twitter.com/lesquive1/status/1413249312465866757)
2. Emurgo has released a guide on how to register for Catalyst voting with your Ledger Hardware Wallet. [https://github.com/Emurgo/yoroi-mobile/blob/develop/catalyst5-instruction.md](https://github.com/Emurgo/yoroi-mobile/blob/develop/catalyst5-instruction.md)
3. Great new interview with World Mobile’s Mickey Watkins, Charles, and John O’Connor. [https://youtu.be/WSSpI8Rtif0](https://youtu.be/WSSpI8Rtif0)

Previously Covered but still interesting:

1. Manuel Chakravarty gave a big update on Hydra (layer 2 scaling). Hydra will not require that the base layer be modified since it will be implemented via Plutus smart contracts. Hydra is actually a collection of protocols including Hydra Head and Hydra Tail. Hydra Head is a symmetric protocol where multiple participants will be online simultaneously for the whole period of the head exchanging messages. Hydra Tail is an asymmetric protocol involving a high performance server and many clients that may be mobile and could be offline for large portions of the tail’s existence. There will also be “inter head &amp; tail networking” which will allow for a network of heads and tails. They have a published research paper on Hydra Head. They are currently writing the Hydra Tail paper.
2. Hydra is distinguished from other layer 2 protocols by its isomorphic properties. This means you will be able to run any smart contract that works on the base layer in a Hydra Head! This is very special. We won’t need special purpose contracts built out just for layer 2. There are some big implications to this. Since a Hydra Head is essentially just a Plutus smart contract, this means you can run a Hydra Head inside another Hydra Head. It’s turtles all the way down, guys. It sounds like they can do this iteratively as much as they want.
3. Aggelos also gave a good presentation on the importance of “skin in the game” in resource based consensus protocols (both proof-of-work and proof-of-stake) and its effect on promotion or discouragement of centralization. He explained how Ouroboros has built-in safeguards to prevent centralization including the K parameter (currently at 500) which caps total rewards per pool and the alpha parameter (currently at 0.3) which splits rewards into a 77% piece and a 23% piece. A pool can take its share of the 77% piece based on the pool’s total stake and its share of the 23% piece based on the pledge of the SPO. A higher alpha parameter makes it less attractive for individual SPOs to proliferate multiple pools since they can’t be as leveraged on their available pledge and still get as big a share of the 23% piece. This also discourages Sybil Attacks. As Cardano on-chain governance progresses, these parameters will be controlled by the community.
4. There will be a Cardano Goguen Summit in September. It will be hybrid digital/in-person.
5. Charles is helping to bring the cryptographer who broke SHA-1 to the University of Wyoming. The Cardano funded blockchain lab there could be on the road to be a powerhouse. [https://twitter.com/CaitlinLong\_/status/1398290866419105802](https://twitter.com/CaitlinLong_/status/1398290866419105802) [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yiqun\_Lisa\_Yin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yiqun_Lisa_Yin)
6. We don’t often get to hear from the engineers behind Yoroi over at Emurgo. But, here’s a podcast with Vicente Almonacid from Emurgo. Check out 12:50 where he mentions the dApp Connector (Cardano’s Metamask Equivalent).

8. Professor Aggelos Kiayias recently dropped a video explaining exactly how Mithril (apparently neckbeard dungeon master talk for elf armor) is going to allow for Perfect Cardano (ADA) wallets that combine the ease of use and convenience of light wallets with the trustlessness of full node wallets. We also learned exactly how Mithril is going to work. [https://youtu.be/LhepJFCyWRk](https://youtu.be/LhepJFCyWRk)
9. In proof-of-work, bootstrapping can be done with blockheaders. This won’t do in proof-of-stake since we need information about stakeholder distribution to confirm block validity.
10. Mithril fixes this by being a cryptographic construction that enables a population of stakeholders to issue a signature consistent with certain constraints.
11. For Mithril to work in proof-of-stake, it needs three crucial properties: 1) it needs to enforce a threshold ratio of stakeholders before the signature is issued; 2) the pre-signature fragments must be independently verified and subject to public aggregation; and 3) it must be efficient in the sense that the final signature is of constant size and is logarithmically dependent on the # of stakeholders.
12. Stakeholders will issue special Mithril keys along with the normal cryptographic key material. Then at regular intervals, full nodes will test whether they can produce a pre-signature fragment. Only a random subset of stakeholders will be eligible to produce a pre-signature fragment. When a sufficient # of pre-signature fragments have been issued by eligible stakeholders then it will be possible to aggregate the fragments into a final signature.
13. This will be a checkpoint that will be verifiable with respect to previous check points all the way back to the genesis block. Such checkpoints will be cryptographic commitments of the relevant UTXOs.
14. Since the checkpoints will be trustless, a light client (i.e. wallet) will only need to verify the sequence of checkpoints up to the current time to trustlessly bootstrap.
15. The ecosystem is growing so fast, it’s hard to keep up with all the projects without these infographics at this point. [https://twitter.com/Dr\_shwetaPHD/status/1398783893638103040](https://twitter.com/Dr_shwetaPHD/status/1398783893638103040)

23. Vitalik is saying it’s highly unlikely we see ETH 2.0 before late 2022. I’m guessing that means mid 2023 which will be after two years of Cardano slaughtering the entire ETH user base. Things are looking so bad that Vitalik says he doesn’t even like using the ETH 2.0 label anymore since he knows the changes will be more incremental. This is what early capitulation sounds like guys.

31. Binance has 63 stakepools charging 6%. Please stop paying so much for the right to stake your ADA. You don’t have to pay that much. You have a huge number of better options. You are literally giving away your ADA rewards to a large corporation. It’s easy: just download the Yoroi Chrome extension, send your ADA there, and pick from the 2k+ available stakepools right inside Yoroi.

32. Nigeria Bans Twitter after Twitter censors Tweet from Nigerian President. This emphasizes the need for decentralized social media. A decentralized solution running on Cardano could fix this.

34. This could have huge ramifications for bank and accounting treatment of Bitcoin potentially including that banks might suddenly be allowed to handle Bitcoin as a foreign currency. Today it was BTC. But, wait until they find out what Cardano can do. [https://twitter.com/CaitlinLong\_/status/1401334421773504517](https://twitter.com/CaitlinLong_/status/1401334421773504517)
35. Nayib Bukele, President of El Salvador, also clarified that there will be no capital gains taxes on Bitcoin since it is a “legal currency” and crypto entrepreneurs will be given instant permanent residence.

52. The Marlowe Webinar with Shruti is now available on youtube. Very interesting discussion of DeFi in general and also specific topics like “deep interoperability” in DeFi. Cardano is obviously already doing the very involved thinking about the future of DeFi. [https://youtu.be/vzsUSG5CSj0](https://youtu.be/vzsUSG5CSj0)
53. John O’Connor recently tweeted about a day where he “wrote a letter to a president” and “found a million users to bring into Cardano”.

57. Hedgefund Billionaire Paul Tudor Jones tells the world to buy crypto and certain other assets if the Fed doesn’t address inflation in their policy meeting that concludes on Wednesday. JP Morgan’s Jamie Dimon concurs that the current inflation is very likely not transitory. This could be tremendously good timing for Cardano given our top five status and the impending mainnet launch of smart contracts.

58. With exploits like this one being all too common in the legacy smart contract networks, we’re not even going to have sell the Cardano use case for DeFi. The competitor networks have already made the case that something better must be on the way.

61. While renewable energy is certainly a wonderful thing, there may be a problem with your technology when your path to compete on clean energy consumption involves you talking about harnessing the power of a whole series of volcanoes. Maybe just use fewer volcano’s and more proof-of-stake?

65. The bank of England is getting very serious about how it “may wish to limit migration” of money from the legacy system to stablecoins. Wow. Just another example of why it’s such an asset (no pun intended) that Cardano is prepared for regulation.

69. It’s a good sign that the top two crypto communities are spending so much time talking negatively about Cardano. You only focus your hatred on that which is most threatening.

70. Bloomberg just published a piece called “America Should Become a Nation of Renters”. While this statement is probably extremely polarizing for Americans, it can also be argued that the death of homes as the primary investment vehicle of Americans may open up a new wave of adoption in crypto as an alternative.

72. All 345,501 of the people who have watched the Lex Fridman/Charles episode as of writing are realizing that Cardano could be the first project to put voting on the blockchain in a U.S. state. [https://www.atalaprism.io/app](https://www.atalaprism.io/app)
73. Days like today in Cardano and the greater crypto space always reminds me that there have been other great adoption stories that went through periods like this.[https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1407077949774442499](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1407077949774442499)
74. It looks like the second biggest ETH stakepool or it's custody provider has lost it’s users private keys to $75MM in ETH. Cardano doesn’t have this problem. We get to keep custody of our crypto because we found a better way than slashing.

77. The June Cardano 360 is currently available on Youtube. [https://youtu.be/al5m14299ww](https://youtu.be/al5m14299ww)
78. We saw segments on various newer partner entities like Nervos, Orion Protocol, and Revuto. Nervos is a UTXO proof-of-work blockchain which is building a cross-chain bridge with Cardano so that you can use your ADA on Nervos dApps and vice versa. Interoperability is a big theme for Nervos and they plan to have a working testnet within a month. Orion Protocol is building a terminal that will allow for decentralized non-custodial trading across centralized and decentralized exchanges. They say this would not require you to KYC or even have an account with any of these exchanges. Revuto is an online subscription management service that recently completed a $10MM token sale on Cardano.
79. It was also revealed that Wolfram Labs, COTI, and IOHK have a three-way partnership (a ménage à tech) to build an NFT auction site. The people from Wolfram were talking about very interesting things including live minting during streaming events and automated upload to IPFS. COTI will be building out auction and bidding mechanisms in ADAPay.
80. Professor Aggelos Kiayias gave us an update on research including that Ouroboros Chronos and Hydra papers have both been accepted into conferences/journals. Chronos will provide Cardano with a global concept of time that doesn’t rely on any outside timekeeper. Prof. Kiayias also pointed out that Hydra is distinguishable from other layer two protocols in that the scripting language is identical to that of the base layer in Cardano such that any dApp that can run on Cardano will run on the Hydra L2. This is a huge plus and superior to many other layer two solutions in other ecosystems where the base layer dApps will not run on layer two. Finally, the Mithril paper has been submitted for peer review. It will provide Cardano light wallets with Succinct Non-interactive Arguments of Knowledge that will give us the best of both worlds: no delays for syncing as in full node wallets while still preserving trustlessness.
81. Finally, the Goguen Summit will be in late September. Sign up now at [summit.cardano.org](http://summit.cardano.org/).
82. The Fed is once again STRONGLY signalling to us that they are going to regulate stablecoins. The Fed is also specifically calling out Tether for the first time. You need to be thinking about how stablecoin regulation might affect your favorite Cardano DeFi or other project.

83. People are starting to realize that the Stakehound private key loss in ETH may attract unwanted regulatory attention to Ethereum 2.0 while this problem could never have occurred in Cardano. Also, only a few days later another ETH stakepool (this time SharedStake...the sixth biggest ETH Stakepool) allegedly experiences a rugpull that some are valuing at over $30MM. This is another problem that could not happen in Cardano staking. It feels like we stepped into the ring, they rang the bell, and ETH just started punching itself in the head. Eventually it’s going to KO itself.

99. Robert Kornacki of dcSpark releases an article on why every Cardano dApp will use NFTs. The article contains some very interesting discussion on smart contracts in the EUTXO context including language instructing that “UTXOs have smart contracts attached to them and not the other way around” and “\[...\]the simplest way to think about it is that when a UTXO is created it has the option to have a smart contract attached to it.” [https://medium.com/dcspark/every-eutxo-dapp-will-use-nfts-and-heres-why-fd87e6a8c9a6](https://medium.com/dcspark/every-eutxo-dapp-will-use-nfts-and-heres-why-fd87e6a8c9a6)

CryptoCurrency,The people who call Algorand centralized don’t know how it works.,"Algorand’s core technology revolves around algorithmic randomness. It chooses 1 random token in circulation to be the block proposer. Then, 1,000 random tokens are chosen to approve the proposer’s block or deny it if it’s deemed malicious. This happens every ~4 seconds that will soon go to every ~2 seconds. 

The nodes only lay the communication roads (I believe). If the internet was disconnected between continents, the system will go in a lockdown mode and prevent any wallets from losing funds. A safety feature that does not exist in most other blockchains. 

I am not the wisest when it comes to blockchain so if I am wrong please correct me. 

opinions:

I also believe the many security protocols and consensus methods make it the perfect contender for actual global economic uses. No 1 location or group control mining pools (recently found out BTC has a mining pool responsible for &gt;51% hashing). Nobody with super beefed up hardware can just pull up and have the “nothing to lose everything to gain” malicious mentality. 

The biggest flex is its 0% downtime since launch. Not 1 failed transaction since its launch. This is also very assuring for CBDC implementation. The room for error has to be very small or nonexistent.

The only way Algorand can be taken down is if somebody like the Joker becomes a multi-billionaire and wants to burn their money and fault the Algorand system. Even then it’s pretty damn difficult to do so. 

I can already smell the few comments calling me a “shill” and to that I answer back with a question, what do we do on r/cryptocurrency to begin with? It’s to talk about currencies.",cryptocurrency
CryptoCurrency,"In 1923 after Hitler was released from prison, the New York Times had this to say "" He is no longer to be feared and it is believed he will retire to private life in Austria"" 10 years later he was Chancellor of Germany.","The point of sharing this headline is not to start a political discussion, rather to showcase how consistent the media is at getting it wrong. Poor predictions didn't start in the 2010s with countless wrong cryptocurrency predictions and they won't end with crypto predictions either. 

News analysts are like economists, they're great at telling you what happened and why it happened, not what's going to happen. In this day of short attention spans and click baity headlines, analysts and the media has to say something to get your attention. If one article says they see BTC at $70,000 by the end of the year, do you know how the next article is going to grab the readers' attention? ""BTC at $100k by the end of the year"". And then the next article has to beat that.   


The same applies in the bear market, if a news article is talking about the risk of BTC falling to $25k, you can be sure the next article will be talking about the risk of BTC falling to $20K, $15K or $10K.

MachineLearning,[P] FEDOT - AutoML framework for composite pipelines,"Hi! I want to discuss the academic project FEDOT ([https://github.com/nccr-itmo/FEDOT](https://github.com/nccr-itmo/FEDOT)) that is devoted to the evolutionary AutoML for composite pipelines. I am one of the developers of this framework and hope to obtain some feedback on this solution and share our experience.

FEDOT is an open-source framework for automated modeling and machine learning (AutoML). It can build custom modeling pipelines for different real-world processes in an automated way using an evolutionary approach. FEDOT supports classification (binary and multiclass), regression, and time series forecasting tasks, as well as different data types and multi-modal cases. Also, sensitivity analysis of the pipelines, custom pipelines design as the initial assumption of optimization, domain-specific objective functions, and other interesting features are implemented.  


The framework is actively developing, so any issues, pull requests and comments are welcome on GitHub.

personalfinance,Advice on what to pay off/save for first,"My wife and I have $7k saved in our emergency fund. This satisfies all of our deductibles and about 1 month of expenses for one of us. Our expenses are pretty close to our income (we're working on that). As you'll see below, we are digging out of a hole. 

I'd love some advice on what to focus on in sequence. 

Our debt:
LOTS of student loan debt at relatively low interest rate. May not pay this off in our lifetime

- I also have a private student loan of $2,700 at 8% interest

-A $4,000 furniture purchase on a 0% interest credit card expiring 10 months from now (currently putting $400/mo towards it)

- A credit card with $4,000 ($153/mo) and one with $8,000  ($193/mo). Typical high rates

- We leased two cars 2 years ago and we plan to exercise the option to buy them next year. We believe this makes sense because the mileage is super low and they're projected to be worth more than the sale price we agreed on when leasing. Also sounds better than the alternative of downgrading to lesser cars when, at least this year, it's a seller's market for used cars. Edit: We're trying to save $400/mo to have 10% to put down next year (this has been hit or miss, in practice)

- Finally, we have an HVAC system that's almost 30 years old and probably will need to be replaced in the next few years. I've heard estimates of $6,000 to $12,000 for this kind of expense

Given our limited monthly surplus, which I estimate to be about $250/mo (I'm hoping to increase this soon via a raise), should we: 

a) Start saving for the potential HVAC expense?

b) Increase our emergency savings fund (there's obviously overlap between these two options)

c) Pay off the student $2,700 loan asap, which would free up $127/mo we could start allocating to other debt?

d) Pay off the $4,000 furniture card early even though it's 0% interest? This would free up $400/mo.
 
e) Pay off either the $4,000 card or $8,000 card? For example, pay the $4,000 one off, put that monthly cost towards the $8,000 one.

personalfinance,"Dad died, worked on my W4 to get some more money each month, wondering about my loans.","Hey everyone. Since my dad died finances have been a lot more tricky. My dad was a huge financial guy, he owned his own business in a dying industry (machine shop) for over 20 years and drilled finances into my head. I just want to know if Im doing the right things.

I was fully supported by my parents until last November when he passed. I am paying off a ton of student loans, a car loan, above other bills. 

Here's the scoop: I am trying to find ways to get extra money each month to make things a tad easier. Here's what I pay:

- Im going to be getting about 3800 a month after adjusting my W4

- (320) + (520) I round to (900) for my student loans a month. Theres like 100k left on this one. 

- (120) for my federal loans. Less than 4k left on this one.

- (300) for my car loan, about 9k on this one.
 
- (110) for my phone. 

- (100) for car insurance (600 every 6 months)

- (140) for the internet/home security bill, (150) more to help my mom out.

- And a credit card that I never max out, I get about (500) on it a month if I'm not careful. 1k maximum. I'm going to start being way more careful, only gas and groceries on it. 

- (30) dollars in streaming services.

- (400) I set aside for things like cannabis and alcohol; 1.5 - 2 oz about a month and I'm not a heavy drinker so, maybe like a handle every third month? I understand that this isn't an ""essential"" bill, but I factor it in anyway. I can adjust this in the future if necessary, but I'm just giving reference to how much I spend/make. 

- (75) for a studio rental

- who knows how tf much for food and a gf. She's very willing to help out, but she's a teacher so she doesn't have an income over the summer and I don't want to burden her. 

I was able to save 20k in the bank before my dad died, and I haven't seen that number move since.  

I'm wondering if it would be a good move to buyout my car loan and my federal student loan. That would be about 12k to throw down, but it would save me an additional 420 dollars a month. Maybe even refinance my big student loan? 730 credit score, and I applied when I had 600. 

What do you think? Any advice you can offer would be much appreciated.",finance
personalfinance,To repay the non-callable debt or to reduce margin loan?,"I'm using the lifecycle investing strategy and is in deleveraging phase.

Now that I'm deleveraging, I wonder whether I should repay the non-callable debt first? Or reduce my margin loan first?

CryptoCurrency,"Wells Fargo is closing credit lines to customers! Other big banks to follow suit?

They may be expecting housing and stock market correction, and if that happens and the crypto market goes up, imagine what would happen with the crypto lending platforms! 

Right now banks are giving 1% interest on deposits per year (at best) and crypto lending platforms are giving 12% per year or more! Banks' credit lines have yearly interest rates of 17-20%, and crypto lending platforms charge as low as 7% yearly.

But most of all, if you put crypto as collateral and the crypto market goes up, your credit is paid off automatically! And the crypto market is bound to go up. The future is bright for crypto lending platforms and their tokens will go up and up (in my humble opinion, not a financial advice).

stocks,Why VRTX is a Deep Value Cash-Flow Machine,"This is my first time writing a company analysis/dd so feel free to leave any criticism in the comments. Hope this analysis is helpful to some of you.

Vertex Pharmaceuticals is a large-cap American biopharmaceutical company which uses rational drug design to develop treatments for several disorders. The stock has been long overlooked by retail investors but is no stranger to institutions -- massive hedge funds such as Renaissance Technologies, Point72 and Man Group are all long with large positions. Currently, there are several catalysts for growth in the upcoming years for Vertex.

Here is some analysis regarding Vertex’s operations, financials and future growth prospects…

&amp;#x200B;

1. TRIKAFTA

*“Cystic fibrosis, a rare, progressive, life-threatening disease, results in the formation of thick mucus that builds up in the lungs, digestive tract, and other parts of the body. It leads to severe respiratory and digestive problems as well as other complications such as infections and diabetes. Cystic fibrosis is caused by a defective protein that results from mutations in the CFTR gene. While there are approximately 2,000 known mutations of the CFTR gene, the most common mutation is the F508del mutation. Trikafta is a combination of three drugs that target the defective CFTR protein. It helps the protein made by the CFTR gene mutation function more effectively. Currently available therapies that target the defective protein are treatment options for some patients with cystic fibrosis, but many patients have mutations that are ineligible for treatment. Trikafta is the first approved treatment that is effective for cystic fibrosis patients 12 years and older with at least one F508del mutation, which affects 90% of the population with cystic fibrosis or roughly 27,000 people in the United States” ­*– US Food and Drug Administration

Trikafta is the first FDA approved treatment for cystic fibrosis which is capable of treating 90% of patients with the disorder. Vertex currently has a firm economic moat on medicinal treatment for cystic fibrosis as it is the only company with FDA approved drugs for treating the disorder. Trikafta accounts for 70% of Vertex’s revenues and has the potential to drive far more profit for the company with the massive expanding global cystic fibrosis therapeutics market. Grand View Research expects the global cystic fibrosis therapeutics market to grow at a rate of 16.7% CAGR until 2025. Vertex could see growth which far exceeds that of this market due to its ever-growing share in the market. Essentially, the global cystic fibrosis therapeutics market growth rate + Trikafta’s market share growth rate would equate to Vertex’s revenue growth rate with Trikafta. With the drug’s increasingly large presence abroad due to the new approval in Canada as well as across Europe in several countries (57% increase in product revenue in Europe from 2020-2021), Trikafta could become an absolute cash-flow machine for Vertex. At the cost of $311,000 for Trikfta, Vertex could mass up to $8.4B in annual revenue if it were to capture the entire US market share alone. While the drug brought in just over $3.8B in 2020, there is still lots of room for Trikafta in Vertex’s domestic market, not to mention the great potential to scale internationally which has already been initiated.

&amp;#x200B;

2.  GROWTH

Revenue YoY Growth: **33.10%** **LTM**

Diluted EPS YoY Growth: **81.55%** **LTM**

Cash from Operations YoY Growth: **63.03%** **LTM**

Past 5 years Annual Earnings Growth: **53.9%**

As Trikafta’s patent has 16 years until expiry (expiry in 2037), Vertex’s largest source of revenue is here to stay and will continue to grow with the increasingly large demand for such treatment. Any new advances in pipeline for Vertex would also drive tremendous growth for additional revenues. On average, analysts are forecasting earnings growth greater than 20% for the upcoming year, however, with the average earnings surprise of 11.65% from the last four quarters, I believe that earnings growth &gt;30% is fair and to be expected.

Vertex’s high return on equity of 23.0% exceeds the industry average of 16.6% which demonstrates the company’s ability to successfully generate income and growth from equity financing – another positive and promising sign for future growth.

&amp;#x200B;

3.  VALUATION

VRTX has become increasingly cheap over the past few years. The stock has risen significantly in the same time that its P/E multiple has significantly decreased. The stock now trades at 18.81x earnings, 15.96x forward earnings, which represents a 1.59 PEG. This puts VRTX far below the Nasdaq biotechnology industry average of 30x earnings. VRTX is currently extremely cheap based on the most common valuation metrics.

Based on a discounted cash-flow analysis of VRTX\*, an intrinsic value of $406.58 can be extrapolated which presents a &gt;50% discount to its current share price of $197.74 (assumptions include a discount rate of 6.5% based on the calculation cost of equity).

This is all to say that VRTX has some serious deep value and a return to industry average earnings multiples or simply maintaining a similar valuation based on earnings would provide drastic upside (&gt;50%) based on future outlook.

&amp;#x200B;

4.  BALANCE SHEET

Quick Ratio: **4.20**

Current Ratio: **4.40**

Debt/Equity: **0.00**

LT Debt/Equity: **0.06**

Vertex Pharmaceuticals’ balance sheet is extremely strong with minimal debt relative to cash and current assets. The company has also made it clear that they are looking to use their large cash reserve for the acquisition of both drugs and of other pharmaceutical/biotech companies. There is virtually no risk debt-wise for Vertex – a rise in interest rates would not pose troubles to the company at all. Vertex’s current financial health is certainly the best in the biotech industry.

&amp;#x200B;

5.  RESEARCH &amp; DEVELOPMENT

Vertex is in the process of developing several breakthrough therapies for serious diseases and has shown promising success with many of their clinical trials. FDA approval for any of these products would be highly significant for Vertex and extremely rewarding for shareholders. In the event that Vertex is successful in their cell therapy for type-1 diabetes, they could potentially cure type-1 diabetes and thus would consequently capture a large share of T1D market that is expected to grow to $24B by 2029\*. Vertex is continuing to advance in the development of molecular, cellular and genetic therapies aimed at treating many serious diseases. Overall, Vertex is in the process of developing revolutionary treatments that could significantly disrupt the biotech industry. Below is the stated progress on Vertex’s R&amp;D from the latest 10k…

*Beta Thalassemia and Sickle Cell Disease*

In December, we and our collaborator, CRISPR, announced positive interim data from 10 people with TDT or SCD treated with CTX001 and that 20 people with severe hemoglobinopathies have been dosed with CTX001 in the ongoing Phase 1/2 clinical trials. Enrollment and dosing are ongoing, and completion of enrollment in both clinical trials is expected in 2021.

*Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency*

Enrollment is ongoing in a Phase 2 proof-of-concept clinical trial for the corrector VX-864. We expect data from this clinical trial in the first half of 2021.

We discontinued development of VX-814, our first corrector, based on the safety and pharmacokinetic profile of VX-814 observed in a Phase 2 clinical trial.

*APOL1-Mediated Kidney Diseases*

Enrollment is ongoing in a Phase 2 proof-of-concept clinical trial designed to evaluate the reduction of proteinuria in people with APOL1-mediated FSGS after treatment with VX-147. We expect data from this clinical trial in 2021.

*Type 1 Diabetes*

We are developing a cell therapy designed to replace insulin-producing islet cells in patients with T1D. We are pursuing two programs for the transplant of these functional islets into patients: transplantation of islet cells alone, using immunosuppression to protect the implanted cells, and implantation of the islet cells inside a novel immunoprotective device. In January 2021, the FDA cleared our IND for VX-880, the islet cells alone program. We expect to initiate a Phase 1/2 clinical trial evaluating this program in the first half of 2021. This clinical trial will involve an infusion of fully differentiated, functional islet cells, and chronic administration of concomitant immunosuppressive therapy, to protect the islet cells from immune rejection. 

*Investment in External Innovation*

\-  We entered into a collaboration with Skyhawk Therapeutics, Inc., or Skyhawk, for the discovery and development of novel small molecules that modulate RNA splicing for the treatment of serious diseases. 

\-  We entered into a new collaboration with Moderna, Inc., or Moderna, aimed at the discovery and development of lipid nanoparticles and mRNAs that can deliver gene-editing therapies to lung cells for the treatment of CF. 

\-  We entered into a collaboration with Affinia Therapeutics, Inc., or Affinia, to gain access to a novel library of AAV capsids to support on our ongoing research and development efforts in genetic therapies, including DMD, DM1 and CF.

&amp;#x200B;

6.  OTHER POSITIVE SIGNS

·  $1.5B share repurchase program (June 2021-December 2022)

·  High net income margin: **49.00%**

·  Large hedge fund ownership

·  Average analyst price target **&gt;$260**

·  Buy-Strong Buy consensus across Wall Street

·  No underperform or sell targets

&amp;#x200B;

**TDLR:**

Vertex Pharmaceuticals presents remarkable upside for growth with their current products which are continuing to gain market share in an ever-growing therapeutics market, as well as with several breakthrough therapies which have shown to have promising results in recent clinical trials. Such high growth prospects paired with an undervalued company with solid financials makes for a great investment especially at the cheap price it is currently trading at.

CryptoCurrency,Blockchain / Crypto Currency - A Users Guide,"**What is a blockchain?**

It is an “immutable ledger.” Think about it like a book that lives in the sky. Every time something changes, its written down with magic ink, that when dries, never changes. And there are thousands of copies of these books, all getting updated at the same time. If one is ever messed with, the other books would wipe out the problem and replace it with the correct entry.

(Tedtalk – Blockchain Massively simplified)

**What is proof of Work?**

First generation crypto currency worked of the concept of Poof of work. There, it is a race to solve a complicated math puzzle, and perform the block write operation. And as a reward get coin. “Mining.” 

Of the thousands and thousands of machines out there racing to win the next block, only 1 at a time wins. That means the others have literally wasted their energy via compute CPU and GPU cycles. 

[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/proof-work.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/proof-work.asp)

**What is proof of Stake?**

Proof of Stake works on different types of newly developed “Consensus” algorithms. Ouroboros protocol, created by IHOK and Cardano, along with a team of PHDs and mathematicians, is the first of its kind. They created a secure “lottery” consensus mechanism to “elect” the next “slot leader” to write the block. Here each Stake pool can get a chance to be elected by winning the lottery. Each ADA coin represents 1 lottery ticket. When you delegate to the pool, you give that pool your ticket, not your coin. If the pool wins, you get the reward along with everyone in the pool, and the operator. Because there is no more complicated math puzzle, and no more computers racing to solve the puzzle, its much much faster, and much much cheaper. Cardano nodes can be run on Raspberry Pi today.. A lot of nodes out there run on Solar energy. It’s so good, Ethereum, which is proof of work currently, is moving to this model as part of their ETH 2.0 migration. In efforts to reduce gas fees and energy concerns. Pokodot created its own Consensus algorithm. Called Grandpa and so on. 

Each other their own way of doing things. But “gen 3” is not Proof of work.

What you should remember is that for both POW, POS, and others, they are all a means of incentivizing the actual people that run the computers hosting the blockchain code. Without them, there is no “decentralized network of immutable ledgers.” Which is because that’s just fancy talk for machines running our code for free.

**What is Market Cap and coin supply and why should we care?**

Market Capitalization is equal to Price of Coin times Supply of Coin. That is, it. But very important.

BITCOIN has a fixed supply. It is not all mined yet. Not until 2140. But it does have a finite amount, 21 Million.

Here is why you can see a 65K or even 100K bitcoin, but you’ll probably never see a 100 dollar DOGE, or even a 100 Dollar Ada (not soon anyway)

Currently there are 18,752,887 BTC out there at a cost of $34,133.52

That means, the market cap is $34,133.52 x 18,752,887 = $640,102,043,472.24

Cardano, has a fixed coin supply as well. But it is 45 Billion. There are currently 31,946,328,269. So you see the max is 2500x more. Likewise, with 121B DOGE vs 18M BTC - it’s \~6700X more.

At a price is $1.35 that means the market cap for Cardano is $1.35 X 31,946,328,269 = $43,092,275,957 (43B)

DOGE coin, has no supply limit. Currently there are 130,383,034,336 (130B) of them. They make 10K new coins a minute, forever.

You’ll need 135B market cap to reach a 1-dollar DOGE.

To give you some reference. Here is the Market cap of some big names.

Visa – 499B

Adobe – 250B

Amazon – 1.7T

It’s very confusing because every coin has their own supply. Their own way of creating coins and at what cadence. Some even “burn” coins. So, know what yours does and how it works.

**How can I “get in early?”**

First. We are all early. You might not have gotten in on the first floor, but we’re only halfway up the stairs to the second flight.

Global wealth is estimated at 1 quadrillion. All the Market Cap in crypto is at 1.41 Trillion. That’s only 0.12% of the world’s wealth.

When looking for “what could be the next big thing” find something with a low market cap, regardless of coin price, that has a strong chance of doing well because of team and tech, the two Ts.

Also ask yourself.

What are these coins use cases?

Who is their target audience for adoption?

Who is funding them?

Who is their team building it? What is their history?

Do they have a good plan?

[https://river.com/learn/how-much-worlds-money-in-bitcoin/#:\~:text=Global%20wealth%20is%20estimated%20at,represents%200.09%25%20of%20global%20wealth](https://river.com/learn/how-much-worlds-money-in-bitcoin/#:~:text=Global%20wealth%20is%20estimated%20at,represents%200.09%25%20of%20global%20wealth).

**What are your goals?**

Crypto is really split into 4 worlds.

Day traders, H.O.D.L.’ers, Whales, and weak hands.

Day traders realize that this market is very volatile, now, and historically. Good ones, can capitalize on quick gains by buying low and selling high, waiting for a dip, then buying back in, and selling high again, cyclically.

Then there are those that “Hold On for Dear Life.” These people tend to find something they really are passionate about, and never sell. They keep buying. If they see their coin dips, below at what they bought it at, and have some extra funds, they ""buy the dip,"" to ""average down."" Some ""Dollar Cost Average (DCA)"" which is commonly confused with averaging down. But here they buy on cadence, say 10 dollars every Monday, regards of price. 

Whales, are investors that come in with millions and billions of dollars. They often “test” the market buy either buying or dumping millions and billions in hopes to manipulate the market to their advantage. If you’re reading this, you’re probably not in this category, but you should know they exist and effect this marketplace.

Then there are “weak hands.” Do not pick this one. These people buy high and sell low. They only invest based on emotion, and nothing else. When things start going bad, they panic, and sell at a loss. Its much better to let your coin go to .000000001 cents, and just hold on to it in the hopes of a rally years later, then it is to ever sell at a loss. Never do this. Never.

Each has its own risks and rewards.

Day trading can rack up dollars quick, but you can lose them just as quick. And there are tax implicates with trades. Some unknown, and constantly changing.

HODL, might take years, but if you do, the chance of your Return on Invest improves significantly in crypto.

Pick what works best for you but have a plan.

**What is the difference between storing on an exchange or in a wallet?**

A lot.

First, you must remember what the dream of crypto is really offering.

Its offering a way for us to break away from banks. Forever.

Centralized banks that can print money, is a problem. Blockchain solves this.

But not if the new bank ends up being Binace or Coinbase. In fact, keeping your coin in exchanges puts us all at risk of market manipulation by them.

When a certain 1 person or group owns too many nodes, they can make choices that would benefit them. The attack vector is called a 51% attack or sybil attack.

Today however, you need exchanges to on ramp and off ramp FIAT. FIAT money is government-issued currency that is not backed by a physical commodity, such as gold or silver.

But it will not be like that forever. Chains like ADA and DOT will be interoperable with legacy banks and will eventually cut out exchanges.

Personally, I despise BNB coin and binace. They already take high fees, and now they want the control and the rewards too. Coinbase isn’t much better. Again though, a necessary evil, for now.

But more important than the “dream” is that they can be hacked.

They are a website. Not a blockchain. They hold the keys to your wallet, and let you use them with a weak password and no mfa if you like. Its literally like storing your money in a bank. So know your bank. Good thing, like a bank, SOME, are federally insured up to a certain amount. But some are not, and people have lost millions and billions in the past this way.

Lastly, there is the notification of “passive income” and “interest.”

With POS systems, delegators are incentivized to “stake” their coin by earning interest.

With POW systems, like bitcoin, you’d have to stand up your own machine, configure it, and let it use your energy in your house. With things like Cardano Ada, and ETH 2.0, you can now pull your coin off the exchange, put it in a wallet, delegate to a pool, and earn interest. All while maintaining full control of your coins.

**What are Smart Contracts? (This one will blow your mind if you are a developer)**

First let us start with what most people say.

“Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement between buyer and seller being directly written into lines of code.”

Which is true for sure. It helps build trust and removes the cumbersome third party “trusted agent” like a bank.

But what smart contracts really are is “ANY Code” that can be written to a blockchain and NEVER be changed, forever.

ANY CODE. You can write your own coins and put them into the block. It happens a lot.

Games, sure, put in the chain. Check out CryptoKitties.

In the future ALL business will be blockchain businesses. Every transaction, every process in the building and distribution, will be written to a magic book that can’t be messed with.. Ever..

**What are NFTs?**

NonFungible Tokens are the first versions of Smart contracts. 

But you really need to break them into two parts.   
The NFT and the Asset.   
The token is written to the blockchain and never changes, but only represents metadata around the asset.   
The asset is the digital file. Today for the most part that is art. But it can be ANY FILE for a million different uses cases   
The asset, is NOT stored in the blockchain. Its stored, if you're lucky, in an IPFS server.

So what’s the big deal? I can upload a gif to the internet today.

The big deal is twofold.

First, you are not uploading anything to the “internet.” That whole thing we call the internet is flawed. Tracked, centralized, monitored, and gated.

What you are doing is creating an EARLY entry, in a book that will never change for the rest of time.

Let us sit and think about that for a second.

De Beers is going to have to get new slogan. “A ~~diamond~~ NFT is forever”

Right now, it is some awful GIF of a dogecoin. But it is not what it is. It is what it represents.

It is the next chapter in Art history. What is created will last longer than the Mona Lisa. Someday you will have blockchain archaeologist that comb though chains.

Plus, taking away the cool factor, they create a place that you can now prove you did it first.

Artist could upload lyrics as an NFT, and later sell them, without the fear their art might be stolen before a contract is in place. People could attach their house deed to a chain, and ever again dispute who owns the land after a conflict.

CryptoCurrency,How about going half crypto,"Hello guys,

It's been not long time since i got into crypto but I was wondering...

I looked at the annual interest rates and it's way higher than my regular bank rates.

What you guys think about taking half of my fiat and convert it to crypto to benefit from those quite alluring rates ?

personalfinance,Roth IRA withdrawal for student loans + first time home purchase,"Hello, all. I'm workshopping the questions I am drafting for my fiancee's accountant, any help here would be appreciated.

Starting last year, with the federal student loan emergency forbearance, I took $12,000 earmarked for student loan payments and opened/funded a Roth IRA. I figured whatever earnings I made could stay in my Roth IRA and it would work out better than parking the money in a HYSA. That turned out to be far more correct than I expected, and the extra $1,500 or so I had hoped to make is more like $25,000. The nearly $40,000 (including contributions) would make a significant dent in both my student loans and the closing costs/down payment for the home we're purchasing this month, so I'm now planning to withdraw it all.

Since you can withdraw up to $10,000 penalty-free as a first-time home buyer (which I am), I'm planning on using 10k for closing costs/down payment and the rest for my original plan, student loan repayment. My questions are:

* What do I need to do to document that the 10k is going towards the home purchase? My fiancee and I are both on the deed, and to make things simple I was planning to send her the 10k so the money would come from just one account (as she is contributing more than half of the down payment).
* Does the 10k simply come from the contributions, or can I set this up so that I am withdrawing $22,000 penalty-free? In other words, because the Roth IRA withdrawal I plan on applying to hope purchase is less than the amount of contributions I am withdrawing, are the 10k for home purchase and first 10k of contributions being withdrawn one and the same?

For now, I am proceeding under the assumption that I have a tax/penalty liability on withdrawing anything more than the $12,000 I've contributed. Really appreciate any insight as to why that is/isn't the case.",finance

personalfinance,Auto Refi Question,"Is refinancing a car loan the same as a used car loan? I'm considering refinancing my loan and I used a refi tool from Capital One which would increase my interest rate by 0.5%. I also checked the website of a local credit union. They didn't have the same online refi tool but they did have a way to check new and used car loan rates and the used rate was about 1.5% below my current loan. So my question is, is a auto loan refi just a fancy term for used car loan? Because lowering my rate by about a third certainly sounds interesting to me.",finance

&amp;#x200B;

In general:  In high interest rates, bonds do better and stocks do worse than in lower interest rates.  High interest rates means more difficulty growing. It also implies the risk free rate is high so bond yields must rise with it in order to have any demand for corporate paper.

Basic Materials:

The interest rate to commodity price index is inverted.  This is because the demand for commodities falls with the level of economic activity.  This can be seen quite clearly by comparing a chart of interest rates with commodity prices.

The implications of high interest rates are divided across the industry.  Commodity producers will have more difficulty staying profitable and expanding operations.  Cash generation will be severely strained.  Commodity buyers on the other hand will find that expenses are much lower and it easier to get competitive prices.  There are some material producers that will suffer less than others.  In general, smaller companies suffer more because the larger ones are more capable of providing the most competitive prices.

Communication services:

Communications services do well in low interest rates, and tend to struggle in higher rates.  This sector is generally the most overpriced and most leveraged.  Stock prices in this sector may decrease more than the average market does.  In addition to lower stock prices, companies that require a lot of leverage will have difficulty expanding or continuing operations.  Established companies that have less capital intensive operations will fare much better, but still won’t be able to come up with the same revolutionary technologies that come from lower interest rate environments.

Technology:

This sector is unique because it is much newer and has not been exposed to high interest rates.  If the current environment of startups are extended, many startups will find difficulty finding funding and small companies with high debt will face similar problems.  For larger companies, a unique situation is presented.  These companies are known for constant acquisitions and with high interest rates, all of the talent in niche tech businesses will suddenly look much more attractive.

It is possible that the mega cap tech companies will be nearly unaffected because of their massive operating cash flows that are vital to normal life.  Many companies in tech have become very large with a low interest rate for the entirety of their existence.  It is possible that these companies suffer more than older companies of similar operations and size because of a lack of experience operating at higher interest rates.

Industrials:

These companies have mixed implications.  On one end, commodities and other material input are cheaper, but on the other end there is less demand for industrial products in an economic slowdown.  Revenue and cost of goods sold could be expected to decrease, creating smaller, more profitable businesses.

A nice way to think about this is to examine the airplane manufacturing industry in a high interest rate environment.  The manufacturer can acquire the materials and possibly prefabs for the plane for cheaper.  The gross margin on the individual plane is higher as a result, but in the general economy, consumer activity is lower, so there is less traveling and a resulting lower demand for aircraft.

Health Care:

Health care is much less volatile than the average market because the demand for healthcare services is mostly disjoint from economic activity.  The main concerns in health care are shared with the rest of the economy - mostly issues arising in debt refinancing and upgrading or acquiring fixed assets.

Utilities:

Utilities generally underperform in high interest rates.  They take on more debt, require consistent servicing of fixed assets, and are slower to increase revenue than other industries.  When operating conditions are staying similar (utility costs for consumers are not increasing much) and interest rates are high, utilities have a much more difficult time covering capex and depreciation.

Consumer staples:

Consumer staples are historically less volatile than most of the market.  Consumers may not be buying luxury goods or a second home at high interest rates, but like healthcare, consumer staples are not things that are optional for most people.  \[Most?\] Consumers are not going to stop purchasing food and toiletries just because their variable rate debts are becoming more costly.

Finance:

Finance tends to do well in high interest rate environments.  They are able to write higher rate loans, and demand for loans increases.  Insurance historically issued higher premiums.  Financial firms can be viewed as the most obvious beneficiaries of high interest rates at the cost of most other industries.",finance

Forex,EUR/USD: My Complete Weekly Outlook (July 12-16),"Here is my complete weekly outlook for EUR/USD. [For post with included charts, please click here.](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/EURUSD/aexrivzq-EUR-USD-Complete-Weekly-Outlook-July-12-16/)

**FUNDAMENTALS:**

The euro staged an impressive comeback in the second half of the last week, backed by improving risk appetite and a weaker USD. As the FOMC minutes disappointed hawkish market expectations or eased concerns over a premature tightening (depending on how you look at it), the US dollar finally hit some bids on Thursday and Friday, pushing the pair in the vicinity of weekly highs.

In the euro area, the highlight was the ECB's decision to update their monetary policy strategy and apply average inflation targeting, just like the Fed did a year ago. However, with the medium-term inflation projection standing at only 1.4% for 2023, and ECB's Lagarde confirming that the new strategy won't have any implications on when tightening may come, it's hard to believe markets will pay any focus to this. Or, as ECB's Schnabel puts it, ""The new inflation target safeguards our room to maneuver and benefits people.""

What's more important is the EUR reaction to all of this - if the new strategy won't affect ECB's tightening decisions, then this could actually be positive for EUR.

*Latest Headlines:*

*USD News:*

\- US 10-year yields grind to a fresh daily high and dollar continues slide

\- Biden says he expects congress to act on US debt ceiling

\- Fed Monetary Policy Report: Upside risks to the inflation outlook in the near term have increased

\- US May wholesale inventories +1.3% vs +1.1% expected

&amp;#x200B;

*EUR News:*

\- ECB's Villeroy: Sees French economy growing 10% overall in 2021 and 2022

\- ECB strategy review: What was the point in all of this? - MUFG

\- EUR/USD preserves daily gains above 1.1850 amid upbeat mood

\- ECB Accounts: Members debated reducing bond purchases in June meeting

\- EUR/USD Price Analysis: Extra gains likely above 1.1887

&amp;#x200B;

*Upcoming Market Reports:*

Here are the most important market reports for EUR/USD to follow in the coming days (all times are UTC timezone):

The economic calendar for the euro area is quite light (no major reports), which means the EUR/USD pair could continue to follow the dynamics of the USD.

Tuesday at 12:30 ( UTC ): US CPI m/m

Tuesday at 12:30 ( UTC ): US Core CPI m/m

Wednesday at 12:30 ( UTC ): US PPI m/m

Wednesday at 16:00 ( UTC ): Fed Chair Powell Testifies

Friday at 12:30 ( UTC ): US Core Retail Sales m/m

Friday at 12:30 ( UTC ): US Retail Sales m/m

&amp;#x200B;

**INTERMARKET:**

*Yields:*

US yields closed higher on improved risk sentiment, but not German yields rose even higher, faster. The 2-year yield differential looks bullish for the pair for the upcoming week.

*USD Index:*

The USD index fell below a bullish trendline as investors kept selling the currency amid a better risk mood. This also partly explains the negative correlation of the USD with rising US yields on Friday, but the 92.00 level (combined with higher yields) could provide a short-term support for the currency early next week.

&amp;#x200B;

**SENTIMENT**:

*CoT:*

The latest CoT report, covering positions up to the prior Tuesday, showed that speculative accounts cut their bullish positions in the EUR by $1.5 billion, marking the largest adjustment of any major currency. EUR shorts now sit at the highest since March 2020.

Did investors speculate on a possible dovish tilt in the ECB strategy review? Now that ECB's Lagarde clarified that the new strategy won't impact tightening decisions, short-covering could have a significantly positive impact on the EUR.

In the USD, shorts were slashed for the third consecutive week with a reduction of $2.3 billion. Nevertheless, the net positioning remains bearish .

*Currency Strength Index:*

In the last five trading days, both the EUR and the USD are almost unchanged from their weekly opening price, as measured against all other major currencies (i.e. as a currency index.) The JPY and CHF were the strongest, and the CAD, NZD, and AUD the weakest as a result of lower risk appetite. However, trends started to reverse on Friday as investors turned more risk tolerant.

*Risk Reversals:*

The latest risk reversals for EUR/USD (as of July 09) indicate that investors are increasingly protecting against strength in the pair, most notably in the weekly options.

&amp;#x200B;

\* Comment: In the FX market, risk reversals refer to the difference between the implied volatility of the most popular out-of-the-money calls and puts with the same expiration. Higher demand for an options contract increased its volatility and price. Therefore, a positive risk reversal signals that upside protection in the pair is relatively more expensive than downside protection, suggesting that investors are speculating on a rise in the currency.

&amp;#x200B;

**TECHNICALS**

*Price-Action:*

Despite the impressive bull run on Thursday and Friday, the EUR/USD pair remains in a technical downtrend on the daily chart . Only a break above the weekly high of 1.1895 would imply a fresh higher high and a potential trend reversal on the daily.

&amp;#x200B;

The hourly chart shows a ranging market with the weekly high being the next key obstacle for bulls. The intraday uptrend in the second half of the week had strong impulse moves with rather shallow corrections. However, the bull run on Friday shows higher prices on decreasing volume and with low-range candlesticks , signaling weaker demand ahead of the weekly tops.

&amp;#x200B;

*Levels to follow (Liquidity):*

Major resistance: 1.20 (3-week high and round-number)

Minor resistance: 1.1895 (weekly high and 61.8% Fib)

Minor support: 1.1825 (Friday's low)

Major support: 1.1780 ( 3-month low)

&amp;#x200B;

**== SUMMARY ==**

The EUR/USD pair is on a good way to reach fresh highs in the next week. However, for a clear bullish tilt in the EUR sentiment, we need some encouraging hard data from the euro area. This leaves the pair vulnerable to US reports scheduled for the next week ( inflation expected lower, and retail sales expected better.)

Upcoming resistance areas and technicals suggest a potential correction in the pair, possibly towards the Point of Control (1.1835) and Friday's low (1.1825) before yield differentials and positive risk mood push the price higher.

I am 36 and spouse is 38.

$193k combined annual income 
$508k combined in retirement accounts

$198,000 left on mortgage at 2.8% interest 
$2k monthly in daycare for 2 kids 
$1.5k miscellaneous expenses with food, utilities, etc
$500 monthly contribution to college accounts for kids 

I have been looking at the housing market and I don’t think selling my house to get into a more expensive house makes sense because I think a lot of houses are overpriced. 

I’d like more space since my spouse and I are now working from home permanently. The dining room is not cutting it anymore. 

I’d like to add a second story and about 750 square feet. I think this will cost over $125,000. Im in Florida, so if you have experience on costs, please share! 

None if this is urgent and it’s definitely more of a want than need, but I was curious if you all thought it would be better to save and have this in cash or it would be wise to borrow the money since interest rates are low. I’d consider refinancing my home. 

Personally, I am more leaning toward maybe just saving cash for the other upgrades. 

I’m not a fan of taking unnecessary debts where I can avoid it. 

Also have to thank this sub for helping me plan and save through the years.",finance

I decided to try a back testing experiment where I would look at current and recent operations of a company ($GIL: Gildan) and come up with my own five year estimates for growth taking into account quantitative and qualitative factors.  The process was to look at old financials and come up with my judgement.  I have never analyzed $GIL before and I knew nothing about their financial state past or present. I read their annual reports in order from oldest to newest in order to maintain an unbiased opinion.  

I know that some of you will point out that I could have just said that I did this in order to make me look smart by having accurate growth estimates.  I assure you that the point of this post is to highlight the discrepancies between predictions and reality, and hopefully add something to your investing toolbox for you to think about.

**Ten years ago analysis:**

**(2011)** The balance sheet has a good structure.  Current assets along can cover all liabilities quite easily.  Debts are not a problem.  There has been recent sales and earnings with good profit margins hovering around 10%.  Operating cash flow is generating consistent cash flow.  Net cash flow was negative attributable to a large business acquisition so this year net cash flow was negative but on average could be expected to reach 100M annually.  

Acquisitions:

* The business they acquired was a sock supplier for 350M at a net asset premium of 137M.  
* They also spent 15M on 12M assets on a vertically integrated T-Shirt manufacturing facility in bangladesh.

Inventories are mostly finished goods (About 80% are finished goods) with the remainder being materials, spare parts, and partially finished goods.  Manufacturing equipment is about half of PPE and increased by 100M in the last year.  Goodwill increased by roughly the value excess of assets in the acquisitions.  They have an 800M RLOC with 209M drawn @ 2.3%.

Based on their past income statement data, I would not say it is unreasonable to expect 100M in revenue growth per year over the next five years.  They have increased sales by 300M per year, but to stay conservative I will use the figure of 100M YoY or about 5%. Earnings and OCF will follow this trend.  The balance sheet will stay strong, hopefully with the same structure of assets as we see now. Depending on their appetite, debt may increase if they keep up with large acquisitions.

What actually happened:

2016: 

\-Current assets went up about 500M, or about 60%.  Overall assets increased by 1B

\- Liabilities doubled, Retained earnings increased by about 50%

\- Sales increased by about 1.3B, or 250M per year. Overall increase of about 12% yearly

\- Earnings increased by about 4% yearly.  OCF increased by about 50%, or 8% YoY.

Their financial health got stronger overall.  Sales and OCF did much better than expected, and earnings slightly underperformed.  The operating environments during this period were quite good.  The world economy was experiencing growth after the financial meltdown in 2008 that was above average.  

**Five years ago analysis:**

**(2016)** The balance sheet has good structure.  Current assets are almost double liabilities.  Most current assets are inventory. Assuming that of these only finished products will be converted into cash and receivables nets 640M, which still covers all liabilities.  The company is on track to have almost no need for debt.  Sales are large compared to the balance sheet, and profit margins are and have been above 10%.  OCF is good, but ideally this number would be about 20% larger to cover current asset requirements with a larger debt coverage margin of safety.

They recently acquired a shirt manufacturer for 112M with 14M goodwill.  They also paid 102M for the assets + 26M goodwill in a lingerie company, the first acquisition of this sort.  

It would be reasonable to say that revenue can grow by about 250M per year or about 8% YoY. This is about half of the growth seen in the recent two years, so it is considered a conservaitve estimate.  Net income will likely trail this trend by 20-30% earnings growth has been slightly slower than revenue growth.  Earnings growth can be estimated to be 4-5% YoY, and OCF could follow this closely.  If they manage money right, total liabilities could shrink to ⅓ of total assets in the coming years, although debt may rise as a number if they continue their current acquisition habits.

What actually happened:

2021:

* Sales are at 2B, about a 35% decrease from 2016
* Net income is -220M
* Operating cash flow have decreased by 40%
* All three of my predicted growth rates were useless.  Revenue from 2019 year end was also much lower than the growth rates would have dictated. 
* Instead of selling more shears, they issued one billion in debt payable over the next six years with an average interest rate of 2.8%

It is clear that in periods of stable growth, it is much easier to be optimistic. Who would have been able to predict the pandemic? Certainly not me.  But that is not an excuse for being wrong.  This was a very interesting activity for me to do, and hopefully this can serve as a reminder that predictions and reality can very possibly have zero correlation.  The low growth in 2019 was not related to the pandemic, further proving that predictions - your own or from others or even professionals - have the possibility of being dangerously wrong.

investing,Back testing growth predictons,"TLDR at bottom

I decided to try a back testing experiment where I would look at current and recent operations of a company ($GIL: Gildan) and come up with my own five year estimates for growth taking into account quantitative and qualitative factors.  The process was to look at old financials and come up with my judgement.  I have never analyzed $GIL before and I knew nothing about their financial state past or present. I read their annual reports in order from oldest to newest in order to maintain an unbiased opinion.

I know that some of you will point out that I could have just said that I did this in order to make me look smart by having accurate growth estimates.  I assure you that the point of this post is to highlight the discrepancies between predictions and reality, and hopefully add something to your investing toolbox for you to think about.

**Ten years ago analysis:**

**(2011)** The balance sheet has a good structure.  Current assets along can cover all liabilities quite easily.  Debts are not a problem.  There has been recent sales and earnings with good profit margins hovering around 10%.  Operating cash flow is generating consistent cash flow.  Net cash flow was negative attributable to a large business acquisition so this year net cash flow was negative but on average could be expected to reach 100M annually.

Acquisitions:

* The business they acquired was a sock supplier for 350M at a net asset premium of 137M.
* They also spent 15M on 12M assets on a vertically integrated T-Shirt manufacturing facility in Bangladesh.

Inventories are mostly finished goods (About 80% are finished goods) with the remainder being materials, spare parts, and partially finished goods.  Manufacturing equipment is about half of PPE and increased by 100M in the last year.  Goodwill increased by roughly the value excess of assets in the acquisitions.  They have an 800M RLOC with 209M drawn @ 2.3%.

Based on their past income statement data, I would not say it is unreasonable to expect 100M in revenue growth per year over the next five years.  They have increased sales by 300M per year, but to stay conservative I will use the figure of 100M YoY or about 5%. Earnings and OCF will follow this trend.  The balance sheet will stay strong, hopefully with the same structure of assets as we see now. Depending on their appetite, debt may increase if they keep up with large acquisitions.

What actually happened:

2016:

\-Current assets went up about 500M, or about 60%.  Overall assets increased by 1B

\- Liabilities doubled, Retained earnings increased by about 50%

\- Sales increased by about 1.3B, or 250M per year. Overall increase of about 12% yearly

\- Earnings increased by about 4% yearly.  OCF increased by about 50%, or 8% YoY.

Their financial health got stronger overall.  Sales and OCF did much better than expected, and earnings slightly underperformed.  The operating environments during this period were quite good.  The world economy was experiencing growth after the financial meltdown in 2008 that was above average.

**Five years ago analysis:**

**(2016)** The balance sheet has good structure.  Current assets are almost double liabilities.  Most current assets are inventory. Assuming that of these only finished products will be converted into cash and receivables nets 640M, which still covers all liabilities.  The company is on track to have almost no need for debt.  Sales are large compared to the balance sheet, and profit margins are and have been above 10%.  OCF is good, but ideally this number would be about 20% larger to cover current asset requirements with a larger debt coverage margin of safety.

They recently acquired a shirt manufacturer for 112M with 14M goodwill.  They also paid 102M for the assets + 26M goodwill in a lingerie company, the first acquisition of this sort.

It would be reasonable to say that revenue can grow by about 250M per year or about 8% YoY.

CryptoCurrency,The hard truth,"The next 6 months are going to be a wake up call for a lot of people in crypto and meme stocks 

The last 12 years since the 2008 crash have been a hyper investment period. Almost all sectors at one point entered a bubble. Crypto, energy, technology, healthcare, EVs etc....

Unfortunately the FED broke the money system last year and the party may be coming to an end. Crypto has seen the biggest jump in history backed by literally FOMO and nothing else 

Everyone made money bud. It wasn't your genius strategy. It was literally the easiest time to make money in the market in human history 

While I don't 100% agree with M. Burry; he is right that a major BTC correction is coming. DCA isn't going to work when 90% of crypto goes to $0 

ETH and BTC and maybe a few might survive the mega crash but BTC is now proofing out to $12,500.00. On almost all major models. On chain data suggesting a fair value of $10,000.00 from $20,000.00 in May 

A relief  rally with a max cap of $56,000.00 is still possible but the only model that supports that is Wyckoff and nothing else 

The trigger may be a -10% correction in the NASDAQ

When shit like SPCE jumps 40% because the founder said I'm going to space. You know the market it fucked 

GME, AMC, DOGE and TSLA have been the biggest warming signs in 20 years

It doesn't mean that there won't be money to be made but it's just going to be way harder. No more 50x gains on Dog coins and 10x on ghost chains that have no use function 

ICP was worth $700 and MINA a $187. They  are now $30 and $1.20. With the bottom being around $2 and $0.50

4. Professor Aggelos Kiayias recently dropped a video explaining exactly how Mithril (apparently neckbeard dungeon master talk for elf armor) is going to allow for Perfect Cardano (ADA) wallets that combine the ease of use and convenience of light wallets with the trustlessness of full node wallets. We also learned exactly how Mithril is going to work. [https://youtu.be/LhepJFCyWRk](https://youtu.be/LhepJFCyWRk)
5. In proof-of-work, bootstrapping can be done with blockheaders. This won’t do in proof-of-stake since we need information about stakeholder distribution to confirm block validity.
6. Mithril fixes this by being a cryptographic construction that enables a population of stakeholders to issue a signature consistent with certain constraints.
7. For Mithril to work in proof-of-stake, it needs three crucial properties: 1) it needs to enforce a threshold ratio of stakeholders before the signature is issued; 2) the pre-signature fragments must be independently verified and subject to public aggregation; and 3) it must be efficient in the sense that the final signature is of constant size and is logarithmically dependent on the # of stakeholders.
8. Stakeholders will issue special Mithril keys along with the normal cryptographic key material. Then at regular intervals, full nodes will test whether they can produce a pre-signature fragment. Only a random subset of stakeholders will be eligible to produce a pre-signature fragment. When a sufficient # of pre-signature fragments have been issued by eligible stakeholders then it will be possible to aggregate the fragments into a final signature.
9. This will be a checkpoint that will be verifiable with respect to previous check points all the way back to the genesis block. Such checkpoints will be cryptographic commitments of the relevant UTXOs.
10. Since the checkpoints will be trustless, a light client (i.e. wallet) will only need to verify the sequence of checkpoints up to the current time to trustlessly bootstrap.

52. President of Tanzania calls on the central bank to prepare for the adoption of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. I wonder what crypto ecosystem already has experience working with an African government on a big crypto project and has partnered with a mobile company that is already bringing connectivity to rural Tanzania?

53. Hedgefund Billionaire Paul Tudor Jones tells the world to buy crypto and certain other assets if the Fed doesn’t address inflation in their policy meeting that concludes on Wednesday. JP Morgan’s Jamie Dimon concurs that the current inflation is very likely not transitory. This could be tremendously good timing for Cardano given our top five status and the impending mainnet launch of smart contracts.

57. While renewable energy is certainly a wonderful thing, there may be a problem with your technology when your path to compete on clean energy consumption involves you talking about harnessing the power of a whole series of volcanoes.

66. Bloomberg just published a piece called “America Should Become a Nation of Renters”.

70. It looks like the second biggest ETH stakepool or it's custody provider has lost it’s users private keys to $75MM in ETH. Cardano doesn’t have this problem. We get to keep custody of our crypto because we found a better way than slashing.

74. We saw segments on various newer partner entities like Nervos, Orion Protocol, and Revuto. Nervos is a UTXO proof-of-work blockchain which is building a cross-chain bridge with Cardano so that you can use your ADA on Nervos dApps and vice versa. Interoperability is a big theme for Nervos and they plan to have a working testnet within a month. Orion Protocol is building a terminal that will allow for decentralized non-custodial trading across centralized and decentralized exchanges. They say this would not require you to KYC or even have an account with any of these exchanges. Revuto is an online subscription management service that recently completed a $10MM token sale on Cardano.
75. It was also revealed that Wolfram Labs, COTI, and IOHK have a three-way partnership (a ménage à tech) to build an NFT auction site. The people from Wolfram were talking about very interesting things including live minting during streaming events and automated upload to IPFS. COTI will be building out auction and bidding mechanisms in ADAPay.
76. Professor Aggelos Kiayias gave us an update on research including that Ouroboros Chronos and Hydra papers have both been accepted into conferences/journals. Chronos will provide Cardano with a global concept of time that doesn’t rely on any outside timekeeper. Prof. Kiayias also pointed out that Hydra is distinguishable from other layer two protocols in that the scripting language is identical to that of the base layer in Cardano such that any dApp that can run on Cardano will run on the Hydra L2. This is a huge plus and superior to many other layer two solutions in other ecosystems where the base layer dApps will not run on layer two. Finally, the Mithril paper has been submitted for peer review. It will provide Cardano light wallets with Succinct Non-interactive Arguments of Knowledge that will give us the best of both worlds: no delays for syncing as in full node wallets while still preserving trustlessness.
77. Finally, the Goguen Summit will be in late September. Sign up now at [summit.cardano.org](http://summit.cardano.org/).
78. The Fed is once again STRONGLY signalling to us that they are going to regulate stablecoins. The Fed is also specifically calling out Tether for the first time. You need to be thinking about how stablecoin regulation might affect your favorite Cardano DeFi or other project.

79. People are starting to realize that the Stakehound private key loss in ETH may attract unwanted regulatory attention to Ethereum 2.0 while this problem could never have occurred in Cardano. Also, only a few days later another ETH stakepool (this time SharedStake...the sixth biggest ETH Stakepool) allegedly experiences a rugpull that some are valuing at over $30MM. This is another problem that could not happen in Cardano staking. It feels like we stepped into the ring, they rang the bell, and ETH just started punching itself in the head. Eventually it’s going to KO itself.

personalfinance,"Use capital to pay for grad school, or invest it?","Looking for some advice. I'm a 21 year old going to grad school this fall. Over the past 10 years I have been trading stocks, And have luckily managed to build up a large enough portfolio to pay for most of grad school and graduate with very little debt. However, I am hesitant to pay for school out of pocket, because it seems like a big setback to completely wipe my net worth at such an early age.

My grad school approved me for student loans over two years (Stafford and Grad Plus Loans) with an interest rate of 4% and 5.3%, which are much better rates than the rates by broker gives me for margin trading. If I invest my capital in ETFs and make the average return of the S&amp;P (10%), that should handily beat the interest rate on the loans. Even if I only make 5% I will still break even.

Additionally, I believe I can take a federal tax credit of $2.5k on student loan interest each year, meaning I can burrow up to 50,000 completely interest free. Even with 15% capital gains taxes taken into consideration, this is looking like a more and more promising prospect. On the one hand, I could graduate in 2 years with no savings and no debt. Alternatively, I could graduate with a $60k stock portfolio and $55k student loan debt, which I can slowly pay off using the return from my capital over the next ten years.

The worst case scenario is that my stocks drop significantly in value and I end up having to hold them for a very long time, and pay back the $50k out of my earnings, reducing my quality of life until I am 30. I am almost convinced it is a risk worth taking. Is there anything I am missing here?  My parents where debt averse and always taught me to pay for things up front if I could, but this seems like a good way to potentially create more value with what I have. Any advice or insights would be very much appreciated.",finance
CryptoCurrency,How does CeFi pay such high APY?,"I've been doing some research, in particular with Celsius, for how a company like that offers a very high (compared to outside crypto) APY for Stablecoins.

Here is what I understand so far:

The % interest CeFi (Celsius and Nexo) pays depositors for (e.g. stablecoins)  isn't directly/exclusively from the person that borrows those coins. That borrower provides collateral in addition to paying interest... and that collateral can be loaned out too. They have low loan to value ratios. For example:

You deposit $1k in USDT, and CeFi will give you 10% interest

Someone wants to borrow that $1k in USDT, and is charged 3% interest for that loan.

That person has to put up 2x-4x collateral in something: lets say 4x BTC or $4k in BTC

CeFi will then loan out that collateral to someone who will pay 4% for that $4k in BTC

So, CeFi needs to give you $100 per year (10% on $1k). They're charging $30 per year directly (3% on $1k). Then they make another $160 per year on that BTC collateral (4% on $4k). They make $190 per year to pay you $100/year.

Also that second person that borrowed $4k in BTC will need to provide 2x-4x collateral (I think some businesses can do higher LVR). That collateral can also be loaned out too. It's all keeps adding up. CeFi has large pools of every coin and currency: each pool has some value from depositors, from collateral (and some must be kept in reserve) - the rest can be loaned out.

Overcollateralization allows your $1K in USDT to multiply to larger loan values: and by collecting low interest rates on that larger amount lets them pay a higher % on that $1K deposit.

I know Celsius also allows institutions to trade crypto without working through the compliance of actually owning the crypto and collects interest off the collateral institutions have to put up and collects fees aswell.

This is just my research, so I'd appreciate any input if you think my understanding is off, if I've missed anything or you have another take on it.",cryptocurrency

I have several federal student loans totalling US$25k, interest rates of 3.2%-6.8%. When the national forbearance took effect last year, I stopped paying my student loans and redirected my payments to eradicate my credit card debt. I am happy to report that I use my credit cards responsibly now.

I was also laid off last year by my company, thankfully the severance package was enough to avoid touching my emergency fund. I got a job this year, a career pivot, and I am making almost identical salary as my previous job.

I am figuring out how I should tackle my student loans when the national forbearance ends in September. I was holding out for total or partial student loan forgiveness with the new administration, but am unsure if that will ever happen.

I am thinking:

1. Pay off the entire \~$25k of my loans at once
2. Pay a huge chunk (let's say \~$10k) of my loans.
3. Resume minimum payments this fall

My financial situation:

* Salary: \~$190k
* Rent: \~$2,800 (I live in a very high cost of living area)
* Major debt: Recent medical procedure I am paying $300/mo out of pocket for next 18 months interest free.
* Emergency fund: \~$60k in ""high""-yield savings account
* 401k: \~$70k - aiming to max my contribution this year for the first time. Note: I am in my late 30s, I started my 401k way late.
* (backdoor) ROTH IRA: \~$13k (I started this year and maxed out 2020 &amp; 2021 contributions)

My hesitation: My previous position &amp; my current position are somewhat niche. My background is somewhat niche. And it took me a while to get a job after so many interviews. Granted, this past year has been usual. Since I am new in this position and field, I don't feel secure in my job yet and the potential to fuck up is huge. I don't think think I will feel secure until I've proven myself to my boss and new team. So I am reluctant to make major purchases.",finance

dogecoin,"If there is infinite supply of doge, how can the demand go up?","To me it seems like what will happen with doge is what's been happening to the USD for years now. The government continually prints money because the concept of the gold standard seems to have for some reason become obsolete. This causes the value of the dollar to go down because the value never actually changes. 

With doge, when one buys doge, it creates doge, and there seems to be no regulation for how much there can be.  Infinite doge means doge value goes down.

The only time I've seen it go up is when there is a large influx of doge purchasing due to a popularity spike. And then it comes back down.

I know there are lots of plans for doge, like banks incorporating it into their commerce, and business are already accepting doge as legitimate payment, so that might answer the question of the popularity, though probably only temporary.

The only way I see doge increasing in value to the degree which we classify as ""the moon,"" there would have to be a hard limit on doge production. Federal reserve intervention imposing minting laws. Once there is a cap and doge apps being created, only then, as far as I can see, will we see those genuinely worthwhile gains.

In all this, I've got 25 bucks into doge, so I'm HODLin and hopin with the rest of you, but after some various conversations, I had to think critically and get more perspectives.

CryptoCurrency,What Is Financial Literacy?,"Financial literacy is the ability to understand and effectively use various financial skills, including personal financial management, budgeting, and investing. Financial literacy is the foundation of your relationship with money, and it is a lifelong journey of learning. The earlier you start, the better off you will be, because education is the key to success when it comes to money.

Read on to discover how you can become financially literate and able to navigate the challenging but critical waters of personal finance. And when you have educated yourself, try to pass your knowledge on to your family and friends. Many people find money matters intimidating, but they don’t have to be, so spread the news by example.

KEY TAKEAWAYS

• The term financial literacy refers to a variety of important financial skills and concepts.

• People who are financially literate are generally less vulnerable to financial fraud.

• A strong foundation of financial literacy can help support various life goals, such as saving for education or retirement, using debt responsibly, and running a business.

Understanding Financial Literacy

In recent decades financial products and services have become increasingly widespread throughout society. Whereas earlier generations of Americans may have purchased goods primarily in cash, today various credit products are popular, such as credit and debit cards and electronic transfers. Indeed, a 2019 survey from the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco showed that consumers preferred cash payments in only 22% of transactions, favoring debit cards for 42% and credit cards for 29%.

Being financially illiterate can lead to a number of pitfalls, such as being more likely to accumulate unsustainable debt burdens, either through poor spending decisions or a lack of long-term preparation. This in turn can lead to poor credit, bankruptcy, housing foreclosure, and other negative consequences. Thankfully, there are now more resources than ever for those wishing to educate themselves about the world of finance. One such example is the government-sponsored Financial Literacy and Education Commission, which offers a range of free learning resources.

personalfinance,"If you’re struggling with your FHA loan, mortgage forebearance is a very good option.","Edit: updated information to be more accurate per replies. Thanks!

I noticed a lot of posts from struggling homeowners. The CARES act let you defer your mortgage payments 6 months extendible for 3 more months with no penalties. Unfortunately it officially expired end of June for most loans. HOWEVER, if your loan is FHA backed, the federal government extended until the September. 

https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_21_108

When it comes time to repay, depending on your servicer,  you will have several options including deferment:

There are also home loan modification plans as well that are described in the above link. 

Also, if your loan is not FHA backed, it never hurts to call your servicer and ask if they themselves are extending the CARES act forebearance policy.

CryptoCurrency,What’s the cheapest way to move AMP to a wallet from Coinbase in order to then stake that AMP? (New to crypto),"Apologies for my ignorance, I’m very new to crypto. I bought AMP on Coinbase. I want to stake that AMP but I need to do that from a personal wallet. I downloaded Coinbase Wallet, I can see my AMP, when I go to transfer to my Wallet there is a network fee (I assume this is the gas fee?) and then a Coinbase fee. The Coinbase fee seems high. Is that fee strictly on the exchange side, I.e. no matter what wallet I use the Coinbase fee will be the same? Or is there a cheaper way to get my AMP from Coinbase to a place I can stake from. 

Knowing the current interest rate, I’m just trying to determine how long I’m going to have to leave my AMP staked to make up for the cost of staking in the first place. I know I’m going to have to pay another gas fee to do the actual staking. Not sure if it’s worth it.",cryptocurrency

I pay to take out my own cash, i pay an overdraft fee instead of declining the purchase, i pay fees if i make too many transactions on my own account, i pay fees if my balance goes below a certain point and i get an interest rate that is offensively, insultingly low. 

It costs too much to be poor in America. I'm literally charged by my bank for being too broke and I'm fucking sick of it. Thank you for the pleasure and privilege of using your legacy (read: predatory) cefi financial system but I'm fucking out.

I've had these accounts since i was literally a child, memorized my bank account numbers before i even knew what a SSN was. And it took me 35 years until cryptocurrency opened my eyes and showed me how badly we're being taken advantage of under this system.

So I'm moving on. My savings will be in stablecoins with generous APY because with crypto you do not need exorbitant amounts for your money to work for you. Normal people should have the same access to the same profit mechanisms that the wealthy have and i am of the perspective that crypto **can potentially** facilitate the greatest exchange of wealth this country has ever seen. So I'm starting the process of migrating out of cefi as much as possible and assuming greater control over my own financial future. The bank is not looking out for us, that's for fucking certain, so we might as well start looking out for our own damn selves.

Fuck your bank. Stop trickling our money upward and taking comfort in our financial serfdom, assuming anyone is looking out for our best interests. We have uniquely big opportunities in the labor market and the financial sector to change the landscape and move the balance more in our favor. If it hasn't been working for us then we can either force change or abandon the system, we can rug cefi and they know it and they are fucking terrified of crypto.",cryptocurrency

To be fair I’ve only been buying crypto for about 6 years now so I can see why you would be worried….

If you’re in the UK, be wary of using the big banks for moving money to exchanges as there’s a non-zero risk you’ll wake up to find your account frozen whilst they make sure you are ‘protected’.

Bitcoin,"""Only Invest What You Can Lose"" is Misleading | Debt is not Evil","There are a lot of young people on this subreddit becoming financially literate for the first time, so I'd like to share a few not so obvious things I've learned in the last 5 years that I *really really wish* someone had told me when I was 20.

# Everyone Invests, Some Just Don't Know It

You don't get a choice whether to ""invest"" or ""not invest"" your money. If you ""haven't invested"" your money, you've just invested in cash. In the United States, that means you've invested your money in the United States Dollar (USD).

For an ideal currency, leaving your money in the currency means that it doesn't gain value, and it doesn't lose value. It just remains there, with its same value, until you purchase with it. That's why, traditionally, people have thought of leaving money in cash as ""non-investment.""

There is *supposed* to be no risk to lose your value, and no upside to gain value. Key phrase: *supposed to be.*

When your Grandparents or older folks tell you things like ""cash is king"" or ""you should always have some cash on hand,"" they are giving advice which is drawn from their experience of a far different monetary environment than the one in which we currently live. Theirs was closer to the ideal, where cash really was risk-free, reward-free investment.

So ""only invest what you can afford to lose"" is quite misleading. Typically, the person telling you this is telling you to invest more of your money in cash, and less in other traditional ""investments."" This is an awful idea, because when investing in cash, you are guaranteed to lose. 

There is no investment strategy in the world that is immune to losing money, even cash. There is simply risk-reward for each investment. And in the current environment, cash is a particularly bad one.

# Cash is Trash

Today, cash is a high-risk, no-reward investment. Central banks are increasing the money supply at an astounding rate. In the United States, the money supply [increased](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2SL) by about 25%, or $5 trillion (a little more actually) in just 2020.

Money supply increase devalues the currency with respect to economic output:

* If economic output is stable, then a 25% increase in money supply means that 1 unit of money gets you 20% less than what it used to.
* Let's say the economy grew 25% with the money supply. Your 1 unit of money can now buy the same as it could before, except that you were entitled to have that money go *farther* as the economy grew, and that was taken away from you.

The point is to communicate to all young people that if you are holding cash, you are hemorrhaging money. A conservative estimate for the cost of holding cash over the next decade is 10% a year.

# Living Expenses

Old wisdom is to always keep at least 6 months living expenses on hand in cash. It's referred to, tongue-in-cheek, as ""fuck you money,"" the idea being that if you have to tell your boss to go fuck himself, you won't starve.

In the current monetary environment, you're paying a solid premium on those living expenses, about 5% / 6 months, in order to hold it in cash. Because of this, dropping down to 3 months, or even 1 month isn't so unreasonable. It's really, really expensive to hold money in cash, so decide how big  the risk of needing fuck you money is in your current job.

If you're happy, save some money and ditch the cash. Also, the best investment today is quite liquid, which brings us to...

# Bitcoin

Bitcoin is designed as the ideal money we talked about above. Eventually (we're probably 2 decades away from this), Bitcoin won't lose value, and it won't gain value. It will just *be.* If you have 1 BTC and you hold it for 10 years, it'll entitle you to the same amount of value when you spend it as you provided to the economy when you earned it.

Now, if economic output doubled in that time, your 1 BTC will buy twice as much, but that's still just the 1 BTC of value your initial labor entitled you to, because your labor contributed to that doubling.

Currently, only a very small fraction of the world understands that BTC is the store-of-value asset layer of the future, and so only $1 Trillion of the likely $200 Trillion that will end up there is already there. That's why BTC, *today* is an investment, and not merely money.

But BTC, fundamentally, is *not* designed to be an ""investment"" in the traditional risk-return sense of the word. It's designed to simply hold value over the long term, the way USD and other cash does not (because governments can print more of those at will).

As such, BTC is quite liquid. Even today, you can sell BTC on an exchange like Gemini and withdraw the corresponding currency in less than a day. That means that it would be totally reasonable to hold your 6 months living expenses in Bitcoin instead of USD, and simply sell the BTC if an emergency strikes and you need cash. That way, you capture the upside of BTC, and avoid bleeding 10%/year on your living expenses money.

# Debt and Inflation

The worse cash gets, the better debt gets, and vice versa. When the value of the currency denominating your debt is collapsing at 10% a year, that means that the real value of the debt you must repay is also collapsing at 10% a year.

I'm just going to say this outright: in the currently monetary environment, paying off something like a 6% fixed rate mortgage is a terrible idea. It's throwing away *at least* 4% of your money every year for no reason.

People don't seem to realize that all financial instruments also exist as their mirror, because of opportunity cost.

*Paying off* a loan to the bank is effectively the same thing as *giving a loan* to the bank. If you have a $100 loan, and you're paying $1 interest/year, after one year, you have -1$, then -2$, then -3$. The bank is gaining $1/year from you over the long term.

All you're doing when you pay that off is reversing who gets the $1/year. If you pay that off, and now you have $0, $0, $0, instead of -$1, -$2, -$3. *You* are now earning $1/year, with respect to the loan option, instead of the bank.

When you pay off a loan, you are loaning the bank. Would you rather you have $100 and the bank gets $1/year, or the bank has $100 and you get $1/year.

Ask yourself - in the current inflationary environment, do you really want to be loaning the bank your hard earned money for a paltry 6%? And the lower the interest rate, the worse that is.

# Summary - Opportunity Cost is Everything

Money doesn't exist in a vacuum. All uses of money must be compared with all other possible uses for that same money.

Cash is trash. You want to avoid holding it if at all possible.

Bitcoin is very liquid, it will probably appreciate, and it's engineered to maintain its value across time. It's a better vehicle than fiat (government created and printed) cash in every way.

In an inflationary environment, paying of debt is a bad idea. You'd much rather take a loan from the bank than give the bank a loan. Interest rates matter for this. If the interest on the debt is high enough, it still may be correct to pay it off.

Any interest rate under the rate of monetary expansion is essentially free money, as long as that money is placed in an asset that will hold its real value.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Should I pay $12k to upgrade my pension plan from 2.5% to 3%?,"I’ve worked for approximately 6 years for local government and paid into a pension retirement system. I recently got a new job with another local government and I’m in the process of transferring my previous years of service to the new pension retirement system. My previous job calculated retirement using 2.5% of my annual salary, the new one calculates at 3%. The formula is (Years of Service x %) x Average Highest Salary = annual compensation. 

I am allowed to upgrade the interest rate for the six years I’m bringing in by paying the “actuarial” rate. The actuarial cost is $12,257 to upgrade the years I previously accrued to my new rate of 3%. If I don’t, my original six years will be calculated at 2.5% and any years after that would be calculated at 3%. The annual average highest salary would not change. Currently I’m making $72k but I get 5% raises every year. I plan to work here at least five years so I can be eligible for retirement at 62 (ETA: I’m currently 32). So I would be making around $91k in five years. Based on those numbers, my annual pension would be approximately $27,714 (6 @ 2.5% + 5 @ 3%) or $30,480 (11 @ 3%).  

My husband and I could afford to pay the $12k. At this point, it’s my main retirement option, I have an IRA but I currently don’t contribute the maximum to it but I will now that I have paid down my high interest debt and have stored up savings.

CryptoCurrency,Dutch banks advise to have 1% crypto in your investment portfolio,"I get this weekly email from my bank with about 5 short texts about investments. How the stock market is doing,what the FED and the ECB are doing, house prices going through the roof, that kind of stuff.

This week they publish the first of 3 articles about investing in crypto. Let me summarize:

- at the moment they don’t offer the opportunity to invest in crypto. And they are not going give  advise about it.
It’s a very new investment category with a lot of uncertainties, resulting in high volatility and high risks.


- Crypto is not supervised by AFM (regulatory body that looks after financial products). Therefore it’s highly speculative and can result in big losses.

-There is a big difference between the technology and coins. These are seperate things, often mixed up.

-It’s hard to predict the future because it’s hard to tell what the actual  value of the use cases is.

- in a balanced investment portfolio the expected revenues, risk, diversification correlation and volatility are important. When an extra category is added, diversification and expected revenues should rise, but risk should stay at the same level. At the moment it’s not certain that diversification and correlation rise when adding crypto to your portfolio. While volatility and risk certainly gets up.

Then they quote another Dutch bank that specializes in investment portfolios. They advise to have a max of 1% crypto in an investment portfolio.

personalfinance,Retirement @ 58 strategy,"Situation:

I am 55 now and married with both 401K savings. We plan to retire at age 58 in the Philippines, currently sold our house last year because housing market is so hot that someone bought it cash as is. We are renting now for roughly the same monthly payment as my mortgage before in this way I will just leave without to worry about how long I need to put my house in the market which will delay the retirement and not knowing if housing market will go down.

We have a bout a total of $556K in 401K and 67K pension which I can get monthly when I quit my job. We know that we have about 3 more years to go and we plan to move out of the USA. We plan to withdraw about $100K / year to stay on the lowest tax bracket, so if market wont crash I believe our projected total at 58 retirement age will be at least $700K to $750K, this put me on a 7yr 100K/yr distribution and the dividend will be redeposited back to the 401K. By that time I will be 65 and my wife will be 64. Then we will start to collect social security. Also, since I will move out of state, I believe I dont need to pay local taxes on 401K and just the Federal tax which is about 8.6% after refund when filing.

Question:

1. Is this a good strategy? Or is there a much better way?

2. When do I need to start shifting to a much lower risk portfolio like bonds?

CryptoCurrency,The traditional finance system is broken: Credit agencies actually penalize you if you don't pile on debt! This system requires people to be indebted to those at the top. Such a broken system needs to be dismantled,"A persons credit report is an important puzzle in the traditional finance system, and credit agencies are tasked with drawing up every person's credit report. i.e. they perform the job of telling who is a good participant and who is a risky person. 

One would think that if you dont have any debt, you would be a good actor. Unfortunately, thats not how it works. Your scores are actually impacted negatively, if you dont have any recent loan or mortgage!

[Factors affecting Credit Score - Lack of recent loan instalment!](https://preview.redd.it/e7g4wbimnma71.png?width=632&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c4bdcecc2da4477a3944bbb781e935421c766f0f)

This is how absurd the system is. Even if you dont have a loan to repay, it docks you points in your score! Hello pleb! You are not indebted to the overlords, so your score is affected! Fix this, get a loan ASAP!

Thats why many people are advised to have a credit card or take out a mortgage even though they dont need one. 

At one end, prudent financial advice tells you dont get into debt. On the other end, if you dont have a loan, your score is affected! Of course, taking an unwanted loan does little for you and only pays the banks in a variety of ways from processing fee to interest they charge on your loan. 

Another absurd factor that affects your credit report is opening new accounts! In crypto, you can just spin up an account anytime you want, for a variety of reasons. But if you do that in the regular banking system, it is treated as negative factor!

This is a broken system that is designed to give all the perks to those at the top, while those at the bottom have no other choice but to follow the arbitrary and opaque rules set for them by the overlords. For instance, if you dont have an existing loan or mortgage, chances are your first loan's interest rate would be higher than someone who has already borrowed before!

Thankfully, a fix is here - crypto based credit scores are coming up that will be able to tell ecosystem participants how trust worthy one is based on a direct onchain analysis of their actions. Crypto as a whole will usher in a move away from such broken systems.",cryptocurrency
CryptoCurrency,You are losing out on many opportunities if you aren't putting your crypto to work and simply holding!,"While HODL is a good proven strategy, ETH ecosystem offers you much more! Instead of just having your coins sit in your wallets, you can generate passive income from them while not losing out on their price action.

Here are some ways you can do it1. Providing Liquidity

Platforms like UniSwap aren't new to any DeFi user. Well guess where do the tokens come from when you swap? They come from ""Liquidity"" provided by other users.

**Well what's the incentive for you? :** All LPs divide the GAS Fees users pay when they swap tokens and share it among them proportional to their share. (LP means liquidity provider)

For example, if you provided 100 USDC, 100 DAI to a 1000 USDC-DAI pool, you take 10% of all GAS fees paid by users when swapping DAI-USDC/USDC-DAI

**What is the risk? :** The risk is ""Impermanent Loss"" where you make more profit just by buying and HODLing the tokens rather than providing liquidity. [A great video and read on IL](https://finematics.com/impermanent-loss-explained/)

2. Yield Farming

When you provide liquidity to a platform, you receive some ""receipt tokens"" as a proof that you are the owner of that liquidity you provided. Now what you can do is stake these receipt tokens on ""platforms"" that offer APR% and earn money.

**What's the incentive for the platform to offer APR? :** Newly launched platforms have trouble getting decent liquidity on reputed exchanges like UniSwap. So they encourage users to provide liquidity for their newly launched tokens and as a reward offer extra tokens for such users

**What is the risk? :** Yield farming is the MOST RISKIEST thing to do. The high risk sometimes also brings high rewards.

**Remember the word ""Rug pull""? :** Yield farming is where majority rug pulls happen. When you stake those tokens at the newly launched platform, the devs take all the users' ""receipt tokens"" and head over to UniSwap. Because they own the receipt tokens, UniSwap allows them to remove liquidity that users provided. The devs drain all the liquidity leaving tokens of users ""unswappable"" and worthless.

**INVEST LESS THAN WHAT YOU CAN LOSE IN YIELD FARMING**

3. Borrowing

Imagine you own 1 Ethereum. You suddenly had a need for $500, either to buy them dips or some personal requirement. Now you can sell some ETH and get $500 or, **you can deposit that ETH as collateral and take a loan.**

**But why loan while I can sell? :** Because, you don't miss the potential of the underlying asset. You know that ETH is going to $5K or even $10K so don't wanna sell any part of ETH for $500.

**What's the risk? :** Platforms like AAVE/Compound are as legit as DeFi can get but always DYOR.

**What are the borrow limits ? :** Well the loan to value ratio (LTV) matters. For example 75% LTV means you can take a loan of max 75 USD after depositing 100 USD worth tokens. Your LTV increases as you pay back more loans.

**What to interest rates? :** The interest rates vary. It is currently around 3% for USDC and 0.61% for ETH. Before ETH rates seem lucrative, hold on..if you take a loan of 0.1 ETH (200 USD) when ETH price is 2000..What happens when you decide to payback the loan and ETH price is now 4000? The payback should be of the same asset so you have to payback 0.1 ETH(400 USD). That's why stable rates are high. [More on rates here](https://docs.aave.com/risk/liquidity-risk/borrow-interest-rate)

4. Lending

Well where is the asset coming from when you borrow? The assets you borrow are assets staked or lent to you by other users called Lenders. You can also lend your assets and get rewarded an APY for your tokens. It is currently around 2-3% for Stable coins.

**Bonus :** You also earn APRs on the assets you deposited as collateral! Which means even while your tokens are locked away as collateral in borrowing case, they are also earning some income. [More on Deposit rates](https://docs.aave.com/faq/depositing-and-earning)

5. Staking/Validator

ETH 2.0 is coming and you can stake your ETH in the staking contract and earn nice 5% APR on your staked ETH. If you have 32 ETH, you can become a whole validator yourself instead of joining a pool.

**What are the risks? :** You cannot withdraw staked ETH until ETH 2.0 launches. So if it delays, your ETH is also locked away for more time. [More on staking rewards](https://ethereum.org/en/eth2/staking/)

Now that the price action frenzy is at a low, **I urge everyone to take sometime and understand all these protocols and platforms.** Many DeFi protocols like ones above allow you to truly be your own bank and earn passive income while not losing underlying asset performance.

stocks,"Branson Completes Virgin Galactic Flight, Aiming to Open Up Space Tourism","https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/11/science/richard-branson-virgin-galactic-space.html?smid=url-share

SPACEPORT AMERICA, N.M. — Soaring more than 50 miles into the hot, glaringly bright skies above New Mexico, Richard Branson at last fulfilled a dream that took decades to realize: He can now call himself an astronaut.

On Sunday morning, a small rocket plane operated by Virgin Galactic, which Mr. Branson founded in 2004, carried him and five other people to the edge of space and back.

More than an hour later, a Mr. Branson took the stage to celebrate. “The whole thing was magical,” he said.

Mr. Branson’s flight reinforces the hopes of space enthusiasts that routine travel to the final frontier may soon be available to private citizens, not just the professional astronauts of NASA and other space agencies. Another billionaire with his own rocket company — Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon — has plans to make a similar jaunt to the edge of space in nine days.

In each case, billionaire entrepreneurs are risking injury or death to fulfill their childhood aspirations — and advance the goal of making human spaceflight unexceptional.

“They’re putting their money where their mouth is, and they’re putting their body where their money is,” said Eric Anderson, chairman of Space Adventures Limited, a company that charters launches to orbit. “That’s impressive, frankly.”

At 8:40 a.m. Mountain time, a carrier aircraft, with the rocket plane, named V.S.S. Unity, tucked underneath, rose off the runway and headed to an altitude of about 45,000 feet. There, Unity was released, and a few moments later, its rocket motor ignited, accelerating the space plane on an upward arc.

Although Unity had made three previous trips to space, this was its first launch that resembled a full commercial flight of the sort that Virgin Galactic has promised to offer the general public, with two pilots — David Mackay and Michael Masucci — and four more crew members including Mr. Branson.

This flight resembled a party for Virgin Galactic and the nascent space tourism business. Guests included Elon Musk, the founder of SpaceX; Michelle Lujan Grisham, the governor of New Mexico; and about 60 customers who have paid for future Virgin Galactic flights.

Stephen Colbert of the CBS program “The Late Show” introduced segments of the webcast that included some live video from inside the spaceship. After the landing, Khalid performed a new song.

When the fuel was spent, Unity continued to coast upward to an altitude of 53.5 miles. The four people in back unbuckled and experienced about four minutes of floating before returning to their seats.

Mr. Branson was accompanied in the cabin by Beth Moses, the company’s chief astronaut instructor; Colin Bennett, lead operations engineer; and Sirisha Bandla, vice president of government affairs and research operations.

As the space plane re-entered the atmosphere, the downward pull of gravity resumed. Unity glided to a landing back at the spaceport.

For well over a decade, Mr. Branson, the irreverent 70-year-old British billionaire who runs a galaxy of Virgin companies, has said he believes that commercial flights will soon begin. So did the 600 or so customers of Virgin Galactic who have paid $200,000 or more for their tickets to space and are still waiting. So did the taxpayers of New Mexico who paid $220 million to build Spaceport America, a futuristic vision in the middle of the desert, in order to attract Mr. Branson’s company.

After years and years of unmet promises, Virgin Galactic may begin flying the first paying passengers next year after two more test flights. But with tickets costing hundreds of thousands of dollars, this experience will, for now, remain out of financial reach for most people.

Founding a space exploration company was perhaps an unsurprising step for Mr. Branson, who has made a career — and a fortune estimated at $6 billion — building flashy upstart businesses that he promotes with a showman’s flair.

What became his Virgin business empire began with a small record shop in central London in the 1970s before Mr. Branson parlayed it into Virgin Records, the home of acts like the Sex Pistols, Peter Gabriel and more. In 1984, he was a co-founder of what became Virgin Atlantic, to challenge British Airways.

The Virgin Group branched out into a mobile-phone service, a passenger railway and a line of hotels. Not all have performed flawlessly. Two of his airlines filed for insolvency during the pandemic last year, while few today remember his ventures into soft drinks, cosmetics or lingerie.

The spaceflight company was of a piece with Mr. Branson’s penchant for highflying pursuits like skydiving and hot-air ballooning. And unlike many of the Virgin Group’s businesses, Virgin Galactic has been a major focus of Mr. Branson’s.

Virgin Galactic joined the New York Stock Exchange in 2019 after merging with a publicly traded investment fund, giving it a potent source of new funds to compete with deep-pocket competitors — and publicity, with Mr. Branson marking its trading debut at the exchange in one of the company’s flight suits.

The Virgin Group retains a 24 percent stake in Virgin Galactic.

Virgin Galactic’s space plane is a scaled-up version of SpaceShipOne, which in 2004 captured the $10 million Ansari X Prize as the first reusable crewed spacecraft built by a nongovernmental organization to make it to space twice in two weeks.

Mr. Branson initially predicted commercial flights would begin by 2007. But development of the larger craft, SpaceShipTwo, stretched out.

The first SpaceShipTwo vehicle, V.S.S. Enterprise, crashed during a test flight in 2014, killing one of the pilots. Virgin Galactic was then grounded until Unity was completed a year and a half later.

In 2019, Virgin Galactic came close to another catastrophe when a seal on a rear horizontal stabilizer ruptured because a new thermal protection film had been improperly installed.
The mishap was revealed this year in the book “Test Gods: Virgin Galactic and the Making of a Modern Astronaut” by Nicholas Schmidle, a staff writer at The New Yorker. The book quotes Todd Ericson, then the vice president for safety and test at Virgin Galactic, saying, “I don’t know how we didn’t lose the vehicle and kill three people.”

Mr. Bezos’ flight is to take place about 200 miles to the southeast of Spaceport America in Van Horn, Texas, where his rocket company, Blue Origin, launches its New Shepard rocket and capsule.

Although Blue Origin has yet to fly any people on New Shepard, 15 successful uncrewed tests of the fully automated system convinced the company it would be safe to put Mr. Bezos on the first flight with people aboard.

He will be joined by his brother, Mark, and Mary Wallace Funk, an 82-year-old pilot. In the 1960s, she was among a group of women who passed the same rigorous criteria that NASA used for selecting astronauts, but the space agency at the time had no interest in selecting women as astronauts. A fourth unnamed passenger paid $28 million in an auction for one of the seats.

Neither Blue Origin nor Virgin Galactic flights go high enough or fast enough to enter orbit around Earth. Rather, these suborbital flights are more like giant roller coaster rides that allow passengers to float for a few minutes while admiring a view of Earth against the black backdrop of space.

Mr. Bezos’ company emphasized the rivalry with Virgin Galactic for space tourism passengers in a tweet on Friday. Blue Origin highlighted differences between its New Shepard rocket and Virgin Galactic’s SpaceShipTwo including the fact that New Shepard flies higher, above the altitude of 100 kilometers, or about 62 miles, that is often regarded as the boundary of space. However, the United States Air Force and the Federal Aviation Administration set the boundary at 50 miles.

The company also noted the size of the New Shepard capsule’s windows, and called Virgin Galactic’s Unity “a high-altitude plane” in contrast to New Shepard’s rocket.
Mr. Bezos on Sunday congratulated Mr. Branson and his fellow crew on their flight. “Can’t wait to join the club!” he added in an Instagram post.

Blue Origin has not yet announced a ticket price, and Virgin Galactic’s earlier quoted fare of $250,000 may rise. But on Sunday after his trip, Mr. Branson announced a sweepstakes that will give away two seats on a future Virgin Galactic flight.

Joy-riding tourists will not be the only passengers on future suborbital flights. Both companies are selling flights to organizations including the Italian Air Force where scientists will conduct experiments that take advantage of the minutes of microgravity.

The era of nonprofessional astronauts regularly heading to orbit may also begin in the coming year. Jared Isaacman, a 38-year-old billionaire, is essentially chartering a rocket and spacecraft from SpaceX for a three-day trip to orbit that is scheduled for September.

In December, Space Adventures has arranged for a Japanese fashion entrepreneur, Yusaku Maezawa, and Yozo Hirano, a production assistant, to launch on a Russian Soyuz rocket on a 12-day mission that will go to the International Space Station.

Another company, Axiom Space in Houston, is arranging a separate trip to the space station that will launch as soon as January.

The orbital trips are too expensive for anyone except the superwealthy — Axiom’s three customers are paying $55 million each — while suborbital flights might be affordable to those who are merely well off.

But how many people are willing to spend as much as some houses cost for a few minutes of space travel?

Carissa Christensen, founder and chief executive of Bryce Space and Technology, an aerospace consulting firm, thinks there will be plenty. “Based on previous ticket sales, surveys and interviews,” she said in an email, “we see strong demand signals for multiple hundreds of passengers a year at current prices, with potential for thousands if prices drop significantly.”

Mr. Anderson of Space Adventures is less certain.

“Per minute, it’s like a thousand times more expensive than an orbital flight,” he said. “It’s crazy.”

Two decades ago, Space Adventures did sell suborbital flights including a ticket to Ms. Funk, who goes by Wally. “Wally Funk was one of our first customers,” Mr. Anderson said. “That would have been like 1998.”

The ticket price then was $98,000.

At one point, about 200 people signed up for suborbital flights, but none of the promised suborbital rocket companies was able to get their space planes close to flight. Space Adventures returned the money to Ms. Funk and the others.

Now this unproven suborbital market has whittled down to a battle of billionaires — Mr. Branson and Mr. Bezos.

“If anybody can make money and make the market work for suborbital, it’s Branson and Bezos,” Mr. Anderson said. “They have the reach and the cachet.”",finance
personalfinance,529 plan question,"I live in a state where I can deduct state income tax on my student loan payments. My wife and I both are healthcare professionals with over 6 figures in student loan debt. I’m assuming with *any* loan forgiveness we’d have access to in the future, we’d still have a substantial loan burden. We have 2 young kids and I have a 529 opened and funded monthly for them at a modest amount until I can afford to put in more.

It appears I could benefit from opening a third 529 plan, pay some into it and let it grow, to be used in 5-10 years. I was thinking I could contribute enough to hit the $10k max for myself and possibly contribute to make $10k additional and change the beneficiary to my wife so we could both benefit. After that, we could contribute tiny amounts more to use for a later grandchild or 3rd child.

I’d think that with a time horizon of 5-10 years out, growth in the 529 plan + tax savings at state level would outpace interest rate on the loans themselves. I’d check this against our MAGI for the federal student loan interest deduction as well.

CryptoCurrency,Unlocking the potential of blockchain technology,"The Republic of the Marshall Islands is a country of around 50,000 people spread across more than 1,000 islands in a remote part of the Pacific Ocean. The country relies heavily on cross-border finance and trade, and the complexities of that system can make it difficult for citizens to get certain goods and financial services efficiently.

Now the federal government is seeking to become the first to issue a national digital currency using blockchain technology. Officials hope the move helps citizens avoid high transaction fees, simplifies compliance with international partners, and protects against inflation (the currency will have a fixed supply rate).

The new currency will be based on blockchain technology developed by Silvio Micali, the Ford Professor of Engineering in MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL), and commercialized by Micali’s startup, Algorand.

There has been considerable hype around the potential for blockchain technology and associated cryptocurrencies to disrupt the way money and other assets move around the world. Skeptics of that vision say blockchain technologies are not sustainable or efficient enough for mass adoption.

Algorand believes it has solved those problems with a unique, scalable architecture that doesn’t sacrifice traditional benefits of blockchain technology like decentralization and security.

An increasing number of people are using Algorand for a wide range of applications, from creating carbon credit marketplaces to expediting real estate transactions and, in the case of the Marshall Islands, creating new legal tender.

“The advent of blockchain technology has opened up a world of opportunity for small nations like ours,” Marshall Islands Minister-in-Assistance to the President David Paul said when the country announced its plans. “By issuing a currency that is not physically embodied in cash, that can travel the globe instantly, and that is tamper-proof and completely secure, the Marshall Islands will finally be connected to the global financial system on its own terms.”

Starting from scratch

Micali has long been recognized for his work in cryptography and security. He’s been a member of MIT’s faculty since 1983, and in 2012 was awarded the Turing Award with his collaborator and fellow MIT professor, Shafi Goldwasser.

Working with others, Micali’s achievements include a new way for distributed parties to agree on a value or strategy even if some of the parties are corrupt (reaching so-called byzantine agreement), and a method for parties to securely send information to each other in a way that can later be verified by the public (called verifiable random functions).

Much of Micali’s work occurred long before the rise of modern cryptocurrencies and hype around blockchain. In the case of verifiable random functions, Micali says he knew they’d be useful somehow, but couldn’t figure out the application.

Still, Micali put off learning about blockchains for years after the creation of the first blockchain-linked cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, in 2008. One day he finally walked into his lab and asked some of his graduate students to explain it to him.

“I had two main reactions,” Micali remembers. “One was it’s a beautiful idea. Two was it’s a very inelegant solution.”

Of particular interest to Micali was a problem put forth by the founder of another blockchain, Ethereum. The founder said blockchains can guarantee at most two of the following: decentralization, security, and scalability.

“The notion that something was impossible really attracted my attention, because in cryptography, and MIT more generally, our business is to prove the impossible possible,” Micali says.

Micali also credits MIT’s ecosystem with helping him start Algorand. Of his first 10 hires, eight were from MIT.

“It’s not only the tech, it’s also the entrepreneurial spirit at MIT and the fact that we don’t shy away from challenges,” Micali says. “But the most important source for me and Algorand is also the most important resource at MIT: the people.”

In 2017 Micali started from scratch to build a better blockchain.

The term blockchain refers to records of information, stored in blocks, that users can add to, forming chains. Each block contains an abbreviated version of the previous block and time stamped information like transaction data. As more blocks are added, the previous blocks become harder to alter, providing a secure ledger of transactions and other information. Many public blockchains have associated cryptocurrencies, or digital assets, and information about cryptocurrency transactions is stored on the blockchain ledger.

“The challenge is who should be able to append the next block of transactions to the blockchain,” Micali says. “Because if I have the ability to declare something common knowledge, I have a lot of power. Who should have that power?”

Some blockchains select users to add and validate the next block by having them devote computing power to solving cryptographic riddles. That approach has been criticized for being inefficient and energy intensive. Other blockchains give users holding the associated cryptocurrency power to validate new blocks on behalf of everyone else. That approach has been criticized for being too centralized, as relatively few people hold the majority of many cryptocurrencies.

Algorand also relies on an associated cryptocurrency to validate new blocks. The company calls the currency Algo coins. Rather than giving the power to validate new blocks to the people with the most coins, however, Algorand has owners of 1,000 tokens out of the 10 billion in circulation randomly select themselves to validate the next block.

The tokens are selected in a microsecond-long process that requires relatively little computing power. The random selection also makes the blockchain more secure by giving no clear target to hackers, helping Algorand solve the “trilemma” put forth by the Ethereum founder with a scalable, secure, and decentralized blockchain.

On top of that architecture, Algorand’s community has developed additional features tailored to specific functions, like smart contracts, which can self-execute based on predefined conditions in their code, in some cases eliminating the need for central authorities and intermediaries like lawyers.

To allow smart contracts to execute on its blockchain more efficiently, Algorand created a programming language called Transaction Execution Approval Language (TEAL). TEAL returns a true or false value depending on if specified conditions are met, simplifying the process of creating and executing contracts on the blockchain.

The contracts have since been used to enable financial transactions, build a marketplace for small purchases of gold, and collect small-scale investments in startups.

Unlocking the potential of blockchain

The Italian Society for Authors and Editors was founded in 1882 after artists organized to avoid exploitation. A lot has changed since its founding, with conglomerate streaming services coming to hold huge amounts of power over content like movies and music. The result is a complex copyright ecosystem where royalties for artists are reduced by publishers, lawyers, auditors, and other intermediaries.

But today more than 100,000 artists in the organization have their copyrights digitally represented and can trade or sell those rights at publicly listed market prices on Algorand’s blockchain. The artists can give permission to use their songs in certain cases while retaining the copyrights.

“We enjoy artists, but we often don’t give them what is due to them,” Micali says.

The use case fulfills a central promise of blockchain, empowering people to exchange goods without centralized authorities taking up money and time. It also exemplifies what’s been a huge source of business for Algorand so far: the tokenization of digital assets, also known as non-fungible tokens, or NFTs.

The application also hits home for Micali, who has been happy to see people in his home country of Italy benefiting from his solution.

“It shows how you can regain possession of your own information,” Micali says. “That’s a big trend, because very often to make information available you have to give the rights of your information to someone else, who then owns your information. It’s easy to say you shouldn’t do that, but we need technology to get around it. The only way to go forward now is decentralization.”

personalfinance,"28 y/o, married, and my spouse and I are in a good position financially. We have a few options to play the future and I need some outside unbiased opinions. More details in comments.","Hello all,

As  the title states, I'm 28 and married. My wife and I have been saving  for a house for 4 years now and finally in a position to do so. We live  in Minneapolis/St. Paul currently, we have stable jobs (both make about  50k each), no kids (yet). We've been renting for a long time in a small 1  bedroom unit, 600sq feet for roughly 1,250 for the unit. We've felt  like our life has been on hold. Can't own a dog, cant start our family,  and we've sacrificed a lot of fun and leisure to save for a house just  in time for the housing market to explode in the midst of a pandemic. We  discussed moving into a 2 bedroom, or finding a unit with in-unit  washer/dryers but the monthly payments hike to over 1600 a month usually  in the area we can reasonably live. A house payment in our budget is  actually cheaper than it would be to be more comfortable in an  apartment.

Anyway,  we've debated for a long time what our next move should be. We aren't  emotional home buyers, so we expect to be searching for a while before  we get an offer accepted. I have a car payment at 268 dollars per month  with 14,500 left. This is my only debt. My wife has roughly 67k in  student debt, recently refinanced for better interest rates. Half is  great lakes, other half through sofi. During the pandemic, while her  loans were frozen, she saved her payments to her savings account that  has roughly 8k extra for her loans on top of 5 months back up payments  for her loans if she were to lose her job. We hit our savings goals for  the house earlier than expected as well.

If  we use her extra 8k on the car, I can divert all of my saving potential  to pay down the my loan on the car in less than a few months. I  currently pay all of our bills except for groceries. Having the extra  roughly 300 dollars per month would allow me to take over all living  expenses. We could theoretically make my wife's income totally dedicated  to her loans and have half of them paid in 1 year if we freeze our  savings. We have 4-6 months emergency fund as well.

Does  this sound like a good idea? Are there other options? Having the  entirety of my wifes income not burdened by loans would make our lives  so much easier. We fantasize about it constantly but my wife is worried  about not continually adding to savings when in reality we are losing  staggering amounts of money in interest paid on loans and lost potential  with retirement contribution. Am I crazy?

I  want to have a life. Right now, I work, save money, go for runs, and  golf occasionally. We dont travel, we dont eat out, we hardly have fun.  Every extra dollar out the door on fun feels like death. Its depressing  and I feel like if we dont make a move this will be our lives forever.  Or at least the next 10 years.",finance

personalfinance,Using cash to pay down low interest debt and margin.,"This might be better in the weekly but its just so big and general I think others may benefit from the info as well.   

I've just paid off 3 credit cards. Keeping the accounts open for credit score (current score is 736 but I don't think it's updated since paying off the credit cards)  I now have about 21k in cash 150k invested in stocks, and I make 150k per year. I have 2 more debts to pay.  1st is my car: 32k remaining at 2.5% monthly payment is 557.  I could have this paid off in 2 or 3 months by using my cash and then increasing payments the next month or 2. My worries are, one, closing the account will ding my credit, and two it's only 2.5% so my 21k cash might be better used elsewhere. 

Second debt.  I have $62k in margin on robinhood. (Not included in my 150k invested, this 62k margin as equity would give me 212k invested) 

I hate margin its a looming bad omen that could screw up my portfolio in bad times. But its also only at 2.5% interest (rate is like $130/month) I do want to pay down the margin and I'd be happy to put the 21k here first and then pay off the margin over the next year (not including the sale of stocks which could pay it down sooner) 

So my question is how should I be handling this. Should I pay the car first then pay down the margin (could pay about 5k/month towards margin if I didn't have the car payment.). 

Or should I pay down the margin first.  And then work on paying off the car over time.  

Or neither just keep the 2.5% car loan. And pay down margin over time. And use the 21k to invest more. 

Any help or advice or personal experience would be greatly appreciated!",finance
CryptoCurrency,Creator of Video Downloading Websites Sentenced to Prison in US — Over $1 Million in Cryptocurrency Seize,"The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) announced Friday that Talon White from Newport, Oregon, has been “sentenced to federal prison for creating illegal video streaming and downloading websites.”

The DOJ further described that the 31-year-old built the websites to “illegally distribute thousands of copyright-protected movies and television shows and evading taxes on the profits of his illicit endeavor.”

The case started when investigators received information in October 2013 regarding numerous illegal websites linked to White allowing paid subscribers to stream and download copyright-protected content. The Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) subsequently demanded White cease and desist his illegal activity in 2014 but he ignored the demand.

White then migrated his operations from one website to another over the next four years to avoid detection, the Justice Department noted, adding that he had amassed millions of dollars in subscription fees from his websites by 2018.

The DOJ detailed that after investigators served search and seizure warrants on his house in Newport and several bank accounts in November 2018:

Furthermore, the Justice Department noted that White “filed false personal income tax returns, underreporting his income by more than $4.4 million and causing a tax loss to the IRS of more than $1.7 million.”


White was sentenced to “12 months and one day in federal prison and three years’ supervised release,” the announcement states. He was charged on Nov. 1, 2019, with copyright infringement and tax evasion; he pleaded guilty to both charges on Nov. 25, 2019",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Student loan cash-out refinancing,"Hi everyone!

I'm new here but recently I've been trying to research ways to consolidate or pay down my debt and came across the idea of Student loan cash-out refinancing, I wanted to get opinions on it.

This past year I paid off my car loan and my credit cards so my only remaining debt is my mortgage and my federal student loans. I am currently on an income based repayment plan, and when payments resume in October my monthly payment will be around 200-300/ month. The rest of the information is below, please let me know if it would be foolish to look into this cash-out refinancing to pay off student loans.

My dogs been given a preliminary evaluation of IBD since we can’t do a GI biopsy as we have already spent over 1k doing constant medical checkup. Nothing in her stomach or intestine no liver disease no Addison’s disease bloodworks comeback normal. Yet she won’t stop vomiting until I can raise money for her GI BIOPSY they suggest we Medicaid her for it but so far her simptoms haven’t improved at all in the past 2 days does anyone know what’s going on here. 
THIS PART WILL BE A SMALL JOURNAL OF HOW SHES BEEN DOING WITH THE MED

would like to say she doesn’t puke bile and regurgitates properly incase u have some question also her fecal matter is fine and she’s still eating and drinking normally she just can’t keep it down this have been going on for almost a month now 

Day 1.   
     After taking medicine with whole can of food she puked just a little of clear puke with a little of food much better then her normal vomiting.

Second dose of meds I don’t know if she ate to fast 3 minutes after taking meds she pukes and the puke has a stronger smell then normal don’t know if it’s me but these are my first day recordings

I can’t take a video recording as I’m in the bathroom but she has once again puked for the third time in 30 minutes and the back rubbing  does not work compared to the second time Bella only drank water this time

Id also like to add that I don’t know if it’s normal but Bella’s vomit is very sticky and gel like. I don’t know if dog puke is supposed to be more watery or not just a side note incase 


Day 2
First dose of 2nd day this time I only gave her a small amount of food and will wait 30min to digest food before giving her anymore

After 30min I fed her and 1hour later she shows no signs of puking or indicating she might puke

Observation: her fecal matter seems a little more wet today which I presume to be good

Bella showed signs of puking(the sniffing) but after a minute of observation no back rubbing involved she turned out fine 

Same as day 1 first dose she just has puked about 30min after my last entry though only a little thank god 

After drinking some water at late evening she had a hard time puking and what she did puke was very little her puking noise to say and indication of it was much louder then usual


Just gave her, her 2nd dose of the day No signs of puking so far unlike last time

30-50minutes after giving Bella her med I properly feed fed her unfortunately she could only hold her puke for 15min before letting it all out

Thier seems to be a small pattern after giving her 2nd dose of the day she’s more privy to vomiting





I would give everything for her I’ve already sold my pc for initial charges I can barely do anything now my best hope is maybe u guys gimme a general idea and I run it by the vet in my next visit",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,"Being Audited by IRS, really needing advice soon. Deadline approaching.","I received a letter from the IRS dated July 14th, 2021 which states they've reviewed my 2020 federal income tax return, any information I gave them, and made proposed changes to my tax. As a result, they found that I now **OWE** them $1900, whereas previously they **OWED ME** $14,000. The letter goes on to state that if I agree with their proposed changes, to mail in a payment for the amount owed.

Obviously, I vehemently disagree with their proposed changes. The letter goes on to state that if I disagree with their proposed changes, return a copy of the letter with my explanation and any supporting documents.

On my federal tax return, I filed as Head of Household and claimed my girlfriend and her 4 children as dependents. The online tax service I used added Earned Income Tax Credits for the kiddos. I felt this was appropriate, as I supported my girlfriend and her children for the entirety of 2020. The IRS disagrees. They sent Form 886-H-EIC ""Documents You Need to Send to Claim the Earned Income Credit on the Basis of a Qualifying Child or Children for Tax Year 2020."" It lists all acceptable documents needed to prove that I'm eligible for Earned Income Credit. On the back of this form, it states each child that you claim must be related to you in one of the ways listed below: Your niece or nephew; Your brother, sister, half brother, or half sister; Your stepson, stepdaughter, step-brother, step-sister, step-grandchild, or step-great grandchild; A child pending adoption; or Lastly: Your foster child placed with you by an authorized placement agency. None of these options apply. In my heart and mind they are my kids, but basically, they are just my girlfriend’s kids. Is there any way that I can be eligible for the Earned Income Credit without falling under one of these categories?

I'd sincerely appreciate advice on how to proceed. I'm including some of the scanned letters from the IRS, with personal info redacted.

First Letter: [https://imgur.com/a/XJ8FX5n](https://imgur.com/a/XJ8FX5n)  (This letter actually states an adjustment was made to my refund, changing it to $13,452. The letter is dated 05/03/2021

personalfinance,A friend's student loan refi app got denied,"I have a friend, call her Riz. We need help refinancing her student loans!

She has about $90k private and $90k federal student loan debt, averaging about 9% APR. The federal ones are currently in forbearance due to covid, but only until November. Most her private ones are on graduated repayment plans. She also has a $20k vehicle loan @ 7.5% APR. She has a $3.2k credit card balance transfer that's 0% until next March, when it'll become 24%!

Her gross salary as a provisionally licensed MFT is $42k, and will cap around $60k in her career. Credit score is around 670 and improving. Her housing is covered (live-in maid type situation).

Since the credit card payment is the highest interest, she is making 5 times the minimum payment there to pay it down 1st (even though it's temporarily 0%, since she can't pay it in a lump as it's promo expires, if she doesn't pay it down, it'll very quickly cost more than her loans if she doesn't pay it down). She might be able to pay it off by March.

We just tried to consolidate &amp; refinance her $90k private loans from Sallie Mae to Earnest, but she got denied due to low income-to-debt ratio &amp; affordability concerns (low positive cash flow).

Does anyone have any recommendations about how to proceed? I'm very worried that she may not be able to afford minimum payments for everything after the relief from the forbearance, 0% balance transfer, and graduated payments starts to fade.

Apologies if this sounds silly or uninformed. 

So, Central Banks (USD, EUR, YUAN, etc.) produce money for the government by purchasing government bonds. What is stopping governments from using this money to purchase billions of dollars worth of crypto to take control of it?

This would destroy the value of fiat in the short term, pump crypto, but with the digital Central Bank currencies in the works, central banks could switch to a new currency if they wanted. Whilst one currency crashes, slowly rolling out another in exchange for a lower ratio with a higher interest rate. Then once they hold a desired amount of crypto, sell that to buy their own digital currency, dumping the crypto price and pumping the CBDC.

4. Professor Aggelos Kiayias recently dropped a video explaining exactly how Mithril (apparently neckbeard dungeon master talk for elf armor) is going to allow for Perfect Cardano (ADA) wallets that combine the ease of use and convenience of light wallets with the trustlessness of full node wallets. We also learned exactly how Mithril is going to work. [https://youtu.be/LhepJFCyWRk](https://youtu.be/LhepJFCyWRk)
5. In proof-of-work, bootstrapping can be done with blockheaders. This won’t do in proof-of-stake since we need information about stakeholder distribution to confirm block validity.
6. Mithril fixes this by being a cryptographic construction that enables a population of stakeholders to issue a signature consistent with certain constraints.
7. For Mithril to work in proof-of-stake, it needs three crucial properties: 1) it needs to enforce a threshold ratio of stakeholders before the signature is issued; 2) the pre-signature fragments must be independently verified and subject to public aggregation; and 3) it must be efficient in the sense that the final signature is of constant size and is logarithmically dependent on the # of stakeholders.
8. Stakeholders will issue special Mithril keys along with the normal cryptographic key material. Then at regular intervals, full nodes will test whether they can produce a pre-signature fragment. Only a random subset of stakeholders will be eligible to produce a pre-signature fragment. When a sufficient # of pre-signature fragments have been issued by eligible stakeholders then it will be possible to aggregate the fragments into a final signature.
9. This will be a checkpoint that will be verifiable with respect to previous check points all the way back to the genesis block. Such checkpoints will be cryptographic commitments of the relevant UTXOs.
10. Since the checkpoints will be trustless, a light client (i.e. wallet) will only need to verify the sequence of checkpoints up to the current time to trustlessly bootstrap.

29. The mid-month Alonzo development update from IOHK is out. Alonzo blue is in full swing and they are working on “hello world round trips” going from the node to the ledger and back. Plutus Partners (third party functional dev firms) are working on different use cases ahead of the Alonzo launch. [https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1403314932968574981](https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1403314932968574981)
30. Miniswap gives us the dev perspective on why Cardano’s Plutus is such an improvement over Ethereum’s Solidity. [https://twitter.com/MinswapDEX/status/1403411522110427137](https://twitter.com/MinswapDEX/status/1403411522110427137)
31. Here’s a great ETH vs. Cardano DeFi project comparison infographic. [https://twitter.com/Coin98Analytics/status/1403397242707320835](https://twitter.com/Coin98Analytics/status/1403397242707320835)
32. The Marlowe Webinar with Shruti is now available on youtube. Very interesting discussion of DeFi in general and also specific topics like “deep interoperability” in DeFi. Cardano is obviously already doing the very involved thinking about the future of DeFi. [https://youtu.be/vzsUSG5CSj0](https://youtu.be/vzsUSG5CSj0)
33. John O’Connor recently tweeted about a day where he “wrote a letter to a president” and “found a million users to bring into Cardano”. Sounds like the Cardano train is rolling along as smoothly as ever in Africa. [https://twitter.com/jjtoconnor/status/1402565547716399104](https://twitter.com/jjtoconnor/status/1402565547716399104)
34. Zach Guzman and Mike Novogratz get an opportunity to prove once again how extremely threatened they are by the fact that they can’t frontrun Cardano at this point. [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1404100510525841408](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1404100510525841408)

36. President of Tanzania calls on the central bank to prepare for the adoption of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. I wonder what crypto ecosystem already has experience working with an African government on a big crypto project and has partnered with a mobile company that is already bringing connectivity to rural Tanzania? [https://twitter.com/DocumentingBTC/status/1404126444863766533](https://twitter.com/DocumentingBTC/status/1404126444863766533)
37. Hedgefund Billionaire Paul Tudor Jones tells the world to buy crypto and certain other assets if the Fed doesn’t address inflation in their policy meeting that concludes on Wednesday. JP Morgan’s Jamie Dimon concurs that the current inflation is very likely not transitory. This could be tremendously good timing for Cardano given our top five status and the impending mainnet launch of smart contracts.

38. With exploits like this one being all too common in the legacy smart contract networks, we’re not even going to have sell the Cardano use case for DeFi. The competitor networks have already made the case that something better must be on the way. [https://twitter.com/zapper\_fi/status/1404429179794362369](https://twitter.com/zapper_fi/status/1404429179794362369)

41. While renewable energy is certainly a wonderful thing, there may be a problem with your technology when your path to compete on clean energy consumption involves you talking about harnessing the power of a whole series of volcanoes. Maybe just use fewer volcano’s and more proof-of-stake? [https://twitter.com/\_eLaPs\_/status/1404125569093029889](https://twitter.com/_eLaPs_/status/1404125569093029889) [https://twitter.com/gladstein/status/1402718041557725184](https://twitter.com/gladstein/status/1402718041557725184)

45. The bank of England is getting very serious about how it “may wish to limit migration” of money from the legacy system to stablecoins. Wow. Just another example of why it’s such an asset (no pun intended) that Cardano is prepared for regulation. [https://twitter.com/CaitlinLong\_/status/1405712468823842816](https://twitter.com/CaitlinLong_/status/1405712468823842816)

49. It’s a good sign that the top two crypto communities are spending so much time talking negatively about Cardano. You only focus your hatred on that which is most threatening. I’m glad to see we’re the biggest threat on their radar. [https://twitter.com/nic\_\_carter/status/1405194146063736840](https://twitter.com/nic__carter/status/1405194146063736840)
50. Bloomberg just published a piece called “America Should Become a Nation of Renters”. While this statement is probably extremely polarizing for Americans, it can also be argued that the death of homes as the primary investment vehicle of Americans may open up a new wave of adoption in crypto as an alternative. [https://twitter.com/bopinion/status/1405609396302979074](https://twitter.com/bopinion/status/1405609396302979074)

52. All 345,501 of the people who have watched the Lex Fridman/Charles episode as of writing are realizing that Cardano could be the first project to put voting on the blockchain in a U.S. state. [https://www.atalaprism.io/app](https://www.atalaprism.io/app)
53. Days like today in Cardano and the greater crypto space always reminds me that there have been other great adoption stories that went through periods like this.[https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1407077949774442499](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1407077949774442499)
54. It looks like the second biggest ETH stakepool or it's custody provider has lost it’s users private keys to $75MM in ETH. Cardano doesn’t have this problem. We get to keep custody of our crypto because we found a better way than slashing. [https://stakehound.com/blog-post/fireblocks-eth-2-key-management-incident/](https://stakehound.com/blog-post/fireblocks-eth-2-key-management-incident/) [https://twitter.com/JamesSpediacci/status/1407465311180255236](https://twitter.com/JamesSpediacci/status/1407465311180255236)

56. COTI (a project with very close ties to Cardano) is coming to Ledger. [https://medium.com/cotinetwork/coti-native-is-coming-to-ledger-c56b04df1253](https://medium.com/cotinetwork/coti-native-is-coming-to-ledger-c56b04df1253)
57. The June Cardano 360 is currently available on Youtube. [https://youtu.be/al5m14299ww](https://youtu.be/al5m14299ww)
58. We saw segments on various newer partner entities like Nervos, Orion Protocol, and Revuto. Nervos is a UTXO proof-of-work blockchain which is building a cross-chain bridge with Cardano so that you can use your ADA on Nervos dApps and vice versa. Interoperability is a big theme for Nervos and they plan to have a working testnet within a month. Orion Protocol is building a terminal that will allow for decentralized non-custodial trading across centralized and decentralized exchanges. They say this would not require you to KYC or even have an account with any of these exchanges. Revuto is an online subscription management service that recently completed a $10MM token sale on Cardano.
59. It was also revealed that Wolfram Labs, COTI, and IOHK have a three-way partnership (a ménage à tech) to build an NFT auction site. The people from Wolfram were talking about very interesting things including live minting during streaming events and automated upload to IPFS. COTI will be building out auction and bidding mechanisms in ADAPay.
60. Professor Aggelos Kiayias gave us an update on research including that Ouroboros Chronos and Hydra papers have both been accepted into conferences/journals. Chronos will provide Cardano with a global concept of time that doesn’t rely on any outside timekeeper. Prof. Kiayias also pointed out that Hydra is distinguishable from other layer two protocols in that the scripting language is identical to that of the base layer in Cardano such that any dApp that can run on Cardano will run on the Hydra L2. This is a huge plus and superior to many other layer two solutions in other ecosystems where the base layer dApps will not run on layer two. Finally, the Mithril paper has been submitted for peer review. It will provide Cardano light wallets with Succinct Non-interactive Arguments of Knowledge that will give us the best of both worlds: no delays for syncing as in full node wallets while still preserving trustlessness.
61. Finally, the Goguen Summit will be in late September. Sign up now at [summit.cardano.org](http://summit.cardano.org/).
62. The Fed is once again STRONGLY signalling to us that they are going to regulate stablecoins. The Fed is also specifically calling out Tether for the first time. You need to be thinking about how stablecoin regulation might affect your favorite Cardano DeFi or other project. [https://twitter.com/CaitlinLong\_/status/1408500265397985282](https://twitter.com/CaitlinLong_/status/1408500265397985282) [https://twitter.com/CaitlinLong\_/status/1408572624125534212](https://twitter.com/CaitlinLong_/status/1408572624125534212)
63. People are starting to realize that the Stakehound private key loss in ETH may attract unwanted regulatory attention to Ethereum 2.0 while this problem could never have occurred in Cardano. Also, only a few days later another ETH stakepool (this time SharedStake...the sixth biggest ETH Stakepool) allegedly experiences a rugpull that some are valuing at over $30MM. This is another problem that could not happen in Cardano staking. It feels like we stepped into the ring, they rang the bell, and ETH just started punching itself in the head. Eventually it’s going to KO itself.

65. John O’Connor of IOHK points out that France still controls the monetary policy of 14 countries in Africa. There is definitely a built in market on the continent for a project that delivers monetary sovereignty to the people.

79. Robert Kornacki of dcSpark releases an article on why every Cardano dApp will use NFTs. The article contains some very interesting discussion on smart contracts in the EUTXO context including language instructing that “UTXOs have smart contracts attached to them and not the other way around” and “\[...\]the simplest way to think about it is that when a UTXO is created it has the option to have a smart contract attached to it.” [https://medium.com/dcspark/every-eutxo-dapp-will-use-nfts-and-heres-why-fd87e6a8c9a6](https://medium.com/dcspark/every-eutxo-dapp-will-use-nfts-and-heres-why-fd87e6a8c9a6)

\~Army of Spies",cryptocurrency
CryptoCurrency,"""pOlItIcIaNs pRoBaBlY ArEn't fOnD Of cRyPtO BeCaUsE We cOuLd tRaCk wHeRe oUr tAxEs gO."" You can know this for many countries.","This is a mock post. I'm mocking this subreddit. You people really need think about what the fuck you are upvoting. The direct-mock post is currently sitting with \~400 upvotes on the frontpage. It shows a 3 year old's understading of politics and assumes the Big Bad Government Man comes to your home, takes your wallet, disappears into a dark room with a hellish looking door with all other Big Bad Government People and use the bills in your wallet to snort coke from prostitutes buttholes, light cigarettes and bribe Satan for immortality so they can keep the cycle going.

Unless you live in a developing/very poor country, this is probably **way** far from the truth. 

&amp;#x200B;

The information is out there: 21st century, internet-using governments are not 14th Century Feudal Lords that are just going to take your taxes and hoard/buy stuff you'll never hear about. Politics has come a long way, and the principle of *governmental transparency* is kind of a big driving factor for politics nowadays. Sure, you might not be able to track where exactly **your** lucky dollar went to, but you can very easily get the general idea.  


If you're curious where your tax dollars are going you just need to figure out where that information is by using a very revolutionary tool called [**GOOGLE**](https://Google.com). For example: 

&amp;#x200B;

* If you're curious about the US Federal Spending for 2020: [Click this.](https://www.cbo.gov/publication/most-recent/graphics)

&amp;#x200B;

**FUNDAMENTALS**:

After reaching fresh 2-week highs on Friday, the GBPUSD pair fell sharply overnight as the US dollar firmed with higher UST yields. Markets remain cautious on GBP as the United Kingdom proceeds with their reopening plan, despite a surge in daily infections to around 31k. However, hospitalizations remain low, 90% of the UK population has covid-19 antibodies, and the country is also one of the leaders in vaccination rates. This supports my bullish bias in the currency for the week, assuming risk sentiment remains supportive and the USD continues to slide.

&amp;#x200B;

**INTERMARKET**:

*Yields:*

snapshot

Yield differentials remain supportive for the pair due to the slide in US 2y yields over the last two weeks. This is a bullish sign for the pair.

&amp;#x200B;

**SENTIMENT**:

*CoT*:

The GBP is one of the rare majors that saw an increase in positioning against the USD in the last week (along with the JPY). Net long positioning in GBP rose to $1.9 billion, but it's worth noting that fast money has reached a 12-month extreme, which poses a downside risk for the pound.

&amp;#x200B;

*Currency Strength Index:*

snapshot

GBP is slowly building its bull trend while the USD remains somewhat flat against other majors for the last 6 trading days. Today, risk-off supported the USD and JPY overnight, but the picture is changing ahead of the NY open, with risk currencies (and the pound) recovering some ground and the USD retreating from daily highs.

&amp;#x200B;

*Risk Reversals:*

snapshot

While risk reversals are still skewed to the downside, it's worth noting that GBP call options are recovering vs similar out-of-the-money put options, signaling that investors are increasingly protecting against higer prices in the pound.

\* Comment: In the FX market, risk reversals refer to the difference between the implied volatility of the most popular out-of-the-money calls and puts with the same expiration. Higher demand for an options contract increased its volatility and price. Therefore, a positive risk reversal signals that upside protection in the pair is relatively more expensive than downside protection, suggesting that investors are speculating on a rise in the currency.

&amp;#x200B;

**TECHNICALS**

*Price-Action:*

GBP/USD broke above a bearish trendline and reached fresh 2-week highs, were sellers pushed the price lower overnight. The pair is now finding support at the broken trendline , near the 50% Fib level of the latest bullish impulse move and a horizontal support area . The short-term trend is turning bullish , but 1.3830 (and 1.3815, the 61.8% Fib) need to hold for buying opportunities to emerge.

Pound pairs are famous for their deeper corrections, so the 61.8% Fib may be in play. However, risk tolerant traders may also use the 1.3830 level (which aligns with a horizontal support) to build their long positions.

It's also worth noting that today's (Monday) bear run is accompanied with decreasing volume , signaling that a turning point may be near.

&amp;#x200B;

*Levels to follow (Liquidity):*

&amp;#x200B;

Major resistance: 1.3909 (weekly high)

Minor support: 1.3815 (61.8% Fib)

Major support: 1.3750 (weekly lows and daily trendline)

&amp;#x200B;

**== SUMMARY ==**

UK's ""Freedom Day"" (July 19 when all restrictions should be lifted by the government) could provide further support for the pound despite higher daily infection rates. The number of hospitalizations and fatal outcomes has been greatly reduced, and the majority of the UK population has covid antibodies, which supports my constructive outlook for the pair.

&amp;#x200B;

Pullbacks (like the one today) could be used to enter long in GBP/USD .",finance

## Digital Precious Metals - [Store of Value](https://www.cryptoeq.io/dictionary/store-of-value)

Real-world competition: Gold, silver, and other precious metals

**Bitcoin (BTC)** 

The first and most widely recognized cryptocurrency. Bitcoin allows users to send money anywhere, anytime in a peer-to-peer fashion without the need for banks or governments. It has been analogized to “Gold on the internet” due to its hard money, non-sovereign properties but also the ease with which one can store and send it. Bitcoin is the most secure, censorship-resistant, and de-risked cryptocurrency in the world. Read more about [Bitcoin’s strengths and weaknesses. ](https://www.cryptoeq.io/corereports/bitcoin)

**Litecoin (LTC)** 

The silver to Bitcoin's gold. Litecoin optimized for cheaper, faster transactions compared to Bitcoin while still preserving much of the original design including Proof of Work. Commerce/merchant adoption of Litecoin as a means of payment remains negligible while the security and price relative to Bitcoin have declined over time. Read more about [Litecoin’s strengths and weaknesses. ](https://cryptoeq.io/corereports/litecoin-abridged)

## 

## Digital Cash - [Privacy Coins](https://www.cryptoeq.io/dictionary/privacycoin)

Real-world competition: Physical cash

**Monero (XMR)**

The most private, untraceable, and anonymity-focused cryptocurrency that optimizes for transactional privacy above all else. Less beginner-friendly than its cryptocurrency peers, Monero uses bleeding-edge privacy technology (such as stealth addresses, Ring signatures, and bulletproofs) to preserve user anonymity as well as constantly changing its Proof-of-Work algorithm to combat ASIC mining centralization and optimize for GPU mining. Read more about [Monero’s strengths and weaknesses. ](https://www.cryptoeq.io/corereports/monero-abridged)

**ZCash (ZEC)**

A privacy-focused coin that trades off complete privacy in order to provide an audit function to cater to the needs of regulated institutions. ZCash offers an optional privacy feature that is used in less than 10% of ZEC transactions. Read more about [Zcash’s strengths and weaknesses.](https://www.cryptoeq.io/corereports/zcash-abridged)

personalfinance,Investing savings vs. refinancing my mortgage to lower the payment?,"Hello, everyone.

Back in December, I bought a house on a 30-year, 0% down, 2.67% interest VA loan.  The payments are around $1,600 (including escrow); which are high, but manageable enough that we can live comfortably and don't face any hardships I had the funds to cover a 40% down payment, but we were planning on starting a side business that didn't go gain traction. 

Now that I have those funds in the bank, doing nothing. I'm trying to figure out what to do. I could invest it, or I could refinance my mortgage to get a lower payment. My previous loan officer told me that interest rates have gone up to about 3.25% since December, and are only going to go up.

Would it be worth it to refinance at this point, tax-wise, payment-wise, etc. Or should I consider investing the money?",finance

financialindependence,Follow-up 13 months later: Have any of you taken a year off saving for retirement?,"Last year, I asked you all for [advice on reducing my retirement investments so I could improve our backyard](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/h95fha/have_any_of_you_taken_a_year_off_saving_for/). Well, I took your advice, built all the stuff we wanted, and have just closed out that program of work.

**Edit::** The mods asked me to remove the link to my personal blog with the story of all the work and the pictures. Per their recommendation, though, [I have put the pictures up on Imgur](https://imgur.com/gallery/8ToyDl8).  **/edit**

First off, shout-out to /u/reltubjp, /u/Grey_Duck-, and /u/Askew123 who recommended refinancing our house to pull cash out of the equity for this work. The timing was right and I was able to reduce our interest rate, switch from a 30-year to a 15-year mortgage, and our home value had shot up so the cash we got out covered about 45% of the work.

Thanks to /u/willywonka1971, /u/Doro-Hoa, /u/booostedd, /u/Shortsonfire79, and /u/Ginfly who introduced me to the world of /r/churning and credit card bonuses. For the big projects, I had to write a check, but I was able to use credit cards for a good amount and the bonuses and rewards covered about 2.6% of the total cost (about $1500).

And for everyone who just generally supported reducing retirement investments, thank you! It ended up being the best decision in the end, especially because I didn't have to reduce that much. I dropped my 401k investment to my company match amount for 5 months, but then with covid stimulus checks, a good end-of-year bonus, holiday gifts, a nice tax refund (we had a second kid in 2020 and that jumped our tax refund WAY up because suddenly he got some covid stimulus money on top of the child tax credit), we not only did all the work that we wanted to do, but starting in January 2021 I was able to actually start maxing out my 401k for the first time ever *and* we maxed out my IRA *and* I started a spousal IRA for my wife and maxed out both 2020 and 2021 for her. So not only did we get to build all of our outdoor improvements, we also *increased* our retirement savings.

It wasn't all roses and sunshine, unfortunately. We had some other expenses along the way (as homeowners do), so our sinking funds are gone at this point. I don't have a dedicated salary-replacement ""emergency fund"" and instead have budget categories in YNAB for thinks like home repair, auto maintenance, health, etc. We went about 15% over budget once everything was said and done, and that money had to be taken from those sinking funds.

But I wrote the last check last week and we're done-done. I expect it'll be December 2022 before our cash-on-hand is back where I'm comfortable with it. In the meantime, we'll continue maxing out our retirement. I've learned some more about FIRE since I wrote 13 months ago and I'm a bit more uncertain about when I'll be able to FIRE because who knows what the market will do over the next 15-20 years? With my 401k and our IRAs, it looks like we're on track for me to RE around the age of 50, which is the same year I'll pay off our house after the refinance. But I expect to start contributing around $10k/year to a taxable brokerage beginning in 2023 or 2024 once our cash savings is built back up, so that'd be ~12 years of additional investing by the age of 50. At the very least, I should hit FI before 50 even if I don't retire early.

And between now and then, our family and friends get to enjoy our new backyard, which is spectacular. I'm so very glad I did this, and can't believe how good the timing was. Even with the increased cost of lumber, being able to dedicate the covid checks plus our tax refund to the work really pushed us over the hump.

If anyone else is wondering whether or not to invest their money into something other than retirement, my recommendation now is:

* Check out [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/nufs4d/can_i_afford_this_large_oneoff_purchase/) by /u/monodactyl. I wondered recently if I could afford an electric car, and using the charts they provided I realized that the opportunity cost is 2x the actual cost of the vehicle. I don't want to work another 2.5 years just to have an electric car now.
* Determine if the money will be spent on something that significantly increases your quality of life. For me, a car wouldn't because I don't drive much. But we now spend hours a day in our backyard and our kids love it. We have already hosted two large get-togethers (with friends who are vaccinated) and it was great. Our backyard will continue to be enjoyed for the rest of our lives, so reducing retirement investments temporarily is a great trade-off.

So thanks to everyone for responding and providing me guidance last year. I couldn't be happier with the outcome.",finance
personalfinance,In Over My Head with University Debt - Please Help!,"So here's the deal. I fucked up when I was younger, bigtime. And I feel like I'm still fucking up, but to a lesser degree.

I dropped out of college just shy of a bachelors degree and have been struggling with low income jobs ever since, including six years in the cannabis industry. My job history is shit (less than a year at most jobs) with exception to my most recent job that I've been at for 3 years. I like it, but am not currently getting enough hours to live on so I'm looking for a way out of it. I'm currently 45k in debt with federal loans, and the biggie is 8k in direct university loans which have me locked out of any university-related services (i.e., transferring credits or transcript services, etc.).

CryptoCurrency,How to avoid scams and invest safely!,"This are the top 5 investment schemes that people fall for:

1. Advanced fee scheme: scammer tries to convince the victim to send money (to pay gas fees for example, or trade for you and make a profit) and claims he will repay you an enormous amount of money for your help. Spoiler alert: he isn't.

2.Boiler room scam: using unfair or dishonest sales tactics. Someone sets up a fake company (usually trading company) and promises low fees/high interest rates. Once you have deposited you will never be able to retire your money, so only use trustworthy exchanges and store your crypto on a cold wallet.

3.Fake Guru (investment seminar scum): self-proclaimed millionaires claim they have discovered the secret to get crazy rich crazy fast. They only want you to buy their course/seminar/textbook so they can make a buck. Once you fail with you own money they will tell you it was your fault and that you must have done something wrong when trading at 125x leverage or doing the high risk-high reward stuff they encourage. Think about it, if they really had an easy way to get rich, why sell it to you and not use it?

4.Pump n' dump scheme: they are the most known. Usually organizated through chat rooms in telegram for example, this schemes target small market cap tokens/coins/shitcoins in order to move the price as demand rises exponentialy for a few minutes. They promise guaranteed returns as other people (bots, big investment firms etc) will jump into and buy when they see the price rises. In reality the organizers of the sheme have already bought a sizable amount of this coin and sell it to you once everyone involved raises the price. In a matter of minutes/seconds the price returns to normal and you lose most of your money.

5.Ponzi scheme: finally the most referenced but least understood. They usually promise incredibly high returns ""guaranteed"" (really high APY). You feel the hype for this great opportunity and call friends, family or coworkers so they don't miss this opportunity. In reality, no value is being generated and investors are paid using money that they/other people have put into the project. Once this blows up, those that ""bought high"" or ""entered late"" are literally left with nothing. They might keep going as people keep joining but eventually the scheme runs out of money or cashes out. 
The pyramid scheme is a variation of the scheme in which you are paid more if you bring other people to the scheme.

personalfinance,We sold our house and we are having a tough time finding a new one we like. What next?,"My wife and I decided we wanted to move earlier this year because we are outgrowing our house and want to get a little closer to family. We were in the process of finding a new house but kept striking out with offers because of contingency’s and what not. We finally thought we were going to get to purchase a home, so we listed ours. Purchase of the new home fell through, ours sold in a day… We close on our house on the 30th and starting to scramble on what to do next.  We live in north metro Atlanta, and are looking to stay relatively in the same area. 

Now to the finances. We currently have \~$40k in savings and are set to take home about $160k from the sale of our house after purchasing it 5 years ago. My question is, should we use $100k of that money to pay off my wife’s student loans and buy a less expensive house to live in for a few more years? My wife and I’s base salary together is $180k and I get anywhere from $10k-$20k in commission every quarter. We like to live off our base salary and put the commission into savings as best we can. Currently our biggest expenses are the mortgage ($1500/month but are willing to bring this to $2500 or close to $3k), 1 car note ($682/month), daycare for 2 kids ($1600/month).  Other expenses like insurance and investments come out to about $1k as well.  Once the student loans kick back in, which are mostly Stafford and grad plus so high interest rate, we are looking at about $1k/month but that won’t cover much principal. The biggest thing that worries me is that we pay off these loans, and somehow, they get forgiven shortly after or in the next year or so. Even if only a small amount is forgiven, I would like to take advantage of that. Should we pay them off with the cash we have on hand and live below our means for a few years, or is there something smarter we should do with this money?

personalfinance,"$29,000 cash or 0% car loan","I’m driving a paid off car, very hail damaged, 75,000 miles. (For those digging in my comment history, yes, that car.)

I graduated last year and, with covid going on, I experienced very little lifestyle creep after getting a job and kept the same budget but with a nicer rental house.

Pretax income - $5,000

Rent - $1,200
Phone - $60
Cable/Internet - $90
Car/Rent Ins - $65
Grocery/Utilities/etc - $1,000
Retirement - Don’t remember but I maxed out my match 


I shopped for a car about a year ago and didn’t see anything I liked. Moved cross country and my car is super comfortable for cross country road trips to get home. I like my car so I kept it and only claimed glass damage after the storm.

Just had it in the shop and dropped $600 on the first real “repair” since I had it and know I got off light. Got 4 new tires six months ago. But I’m getting the itch to find a nice used car. I’ve told myself NEXT SUMMER and I’m still feeling guilty about it because I grew up kinda poor and this is the first time ever that I’ve not had a car payment. Looked again this weekend and, still, didn’t see anything that I liked or got me excited. 

If you’re still with me and not completely pissed off at my question:

Should I finance a new or certified pre-owned car? Or pay cash? (What I’m looking for will be around $28-29K after tax, title, etc)

I will have about $15-20K left in the bank. I have a contract with two more years on it. Expenses will remain the same. I have no interest in home ownership here.

I would shop for a 0% interest rate or very low. Would prefer to get a certified pre-owned. Doubt I would get more than $1,000 on my trade in and would rather sell it to a friend who needs a reliable car for $1.

Other than retirement, my money is in the bank collecting some abysmal interest rate in a savings account. 

I realize this is a good problem to have, and I’m not complaining, but would like a 3rd party perspective. I’ve not been fortunate before and my family is all like “treat yo self” but I’m not ready. Thanks!

UPDATE: Keeping the car for two years and investing. Will reassess what I want to do when my contract is up and I decide to move on to a new job or accept the contract renewal. Thanks everyone.",finance

solar,Between two local solar installers,"Hi all! Just bought a home a few months ago and finally ready to take the plunge and put solar on this baby. Shopped around through yelp and narrowed it down to two local companies here. I need advice on which way to go as I have no experience with solar and its equipment at all.

# First Quote:

7.92 kW Panasonic EVPV360x22 with Enphase IQ 7+

Total price includes Permit fees, application, install, 25 yr module/inverter/racking/workmanship/penetration warranties and certified by Panasonic to install their products.

$23,365 ($2.95/watt) + 2k for electrical panel upgrade

# Second Quote

8.6 kW Q Cells Q.Peak DUO L-G8.2 430x20 with Enphase IQ 7A

Same 25 yr company warranties as above and they will extend the 12 yr warranty on the Q Cell panels to 25 yrs.

$21,293 ($2.48/watt) +3k for electrical panel upgrade

This company also offered me an LG system as well:

8.2 kW LG 375 Neon x22 with Enphase IQ7+ for $23,635 around 2.86/watt.

&amp;#x200B;

Not really too sure which way to go, both installers are pretty comparable in terms of services they offer and their reputation/reviews. I am waiting to hear back from the utility company to see if we will be able to do an RMA on the electrical panel to save some money as that is only going to cost around $1375. Thanks for any input!

&amp;#x200B;

Update: I will be going with second quote for the Q Cells! After some back and forth I was able to get them to come down a bit in price for upgraded the panel about $500 so I'll take any little savings I can get. Total cost=$23,793 for 8.6kw system before federal tax credit!",energy
CryptoCurrency,US Federal Tax Dollars and Crypto,"I saw a post earlier today about how congress may be scared of crypto because it would create transparency on where tax money goes.  This concept illustrates a huge blind spot that most people have about how US federal taxing and spending works.  

US Federal tax dollars collected don't actually ""go"" to anything, they are just dollars taken out of circulation. Congress then re-spends the money back into existence and the fed ""creates"" those dollars. The difference between the collected tax dollars and money spent is mirrored in government bonds sold, but again, the US dollars collected from those bond sales doesn't actually ""go"" any where, it is simply taken out of circulation as the equivalent money has already been spent by the Congress and ""created"" by the fed.

Blockchains could create some visibility into where the fed spends its money, but it is likely they would use private ledgers, and even if you were to pay your taxes in, say a digital US dollar, those digital USDs would simply be burned when they are collected, just as they are now.  The US uses the spend first, tax second method, which means it will always be impossible to see where any individuals taxed dollars actually go.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Buying or renting in this market?,"My fiancé and I are in a our mid 30s living in southern California, with plans to live here for the rest of our working lives. We’ve been together for 6 years and we’re finally getting married in the fall and moving in together around the the time of the wedding. We’re trying to decide what’s best considering our circumstances and preferences (mainly: do we buy or rent?). 

We each live with our families at the moment. He doesn’t pay rent and I pay about $500/month. He has a federal government job making $88k/year gross (with taxes and Thrift Savings Plan contributions he nets about $50k/year). He has savings of $97k (just sitting in a savings account) and no debt. I have savings of $114k (sitting in a savings account) and student loan debts of $119k (all federal debt so suspended payments and currently no interest until at least 9/30/21.). I have no other debts. I’m just getting established in my career as a therapist (1099 sole proprietorship). I made 85k in 2019, 155k in 2020, and I’m set to gross about $225k in 2021 (net around $150k—my business expenses are around 5k/year) with income thereabouts for the foreseeable future. I’ve been taking advantage of the QBI and thus haven’t seen the need to incorporate yet. Marrying this year will also help me keep the QBI deduction (since our joint salary will be below the $329,800 QBI threshold). We have zero investments between us other than his TSP. I’ve put off retirement savings as I’ve focused on my education, student loan debt, and career—I do intend to be serious about retirement savings…but just haven’t been yet.

In about 6 weeks I’ll have enough saved to cover my student loan balance and still have a $10k emergency fund. We’re having just a civil ceremony for the wedding, but will do a $5-7k honeymoon. I’m not sure what the administration or congress will do about student loan debt—but there’s a potential that the 0 interest will be extended until the end of the year or until the spring. I’m signed up for the standard repayment plan and am committed to a $1,700 monthly payment. It’s wait and see with student loans—wondering if the $10k or $50k forgiveness comes through (hoping for something but not counting on it).
 
We intended to rent, but our tastes are dictating places that will cost upwards of $4.5k+/month (inclusive of utilities). And when we see those prices we wonder if should be building equity instead. We’re also looking at townhomes for sale and are discouraged when we see one sold and relisted as a rental 3 weeks later (it doesn’t seem reasonable to pay another person’s mortgage when we might be able to get a mortgage ourselves—our credits scores are both 817+, but we're 1-2 years away from having a 20% down payment). 2-3 bedroom townhomes in our desired neighborhoods are running $700-900k at the moment. I’ve read online that for self-employed individuals like myself, banks usually want the previous 2 years of tax returns—so I assume it would benefit me to wait until the new year to include my 2021 earnings and have the student loan debt gone. 

So, in short, if you were in my position, would you buy soon or would you rent and then buy a year from now when the student loan debt is gone, the bank has a better sense of my income, and we’ll be able to put more money down? Regardless, should we meet with a loan officer at one our banks and see what mortgage we could get? I am curious how lenders are and/or will consider student loan debt under 0 interest. If I know that 0 rate interest is being extended another 6 months, I could take from my savings and add it to a potential down payment. Or are banks just going to want me to get rid of the student loan debt as soon as possible? Should we be doing other things with our money (e.g., building savings and retirement investments?) before getting into this overheated housing market? Thank you!",finance
personalfinance,Any tools to calculate tax changes for new jobs and new locations?,"I'm in a situation where I'm a consultant, and the client I am working with would like to hire me full time.

stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Monday, July 12, 2021","**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, July 12, 2021**

After a spurt in volatility last Thursday, stocks have shaken off any jitteriness, with the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Nasdaq (QQQ) once again powering to fresh intraday records today. Looking ahead, market participants are waiting for Q2 earnings season to begin tomorrow, with two of the largest banks in the US, JP Morgan (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS), reporting results and Jerome Powell’s testimony before Congress later this week.

With Q2 earnings are fast approaching, market participants are gearing up for what is expected to be a repeat of Q1 record-setting season, with earnings expected to continue being super-charged by stronger than expected demand from savings-loaden consumers and the continued reopening of the US economy thanks to effective distribution of the coronavirus vaccine. So far, analysts are looking for S&amp;P 500 earnings to grow by 61.9% year-on-year in aggregate, according to FactSet data – an estimate UBS's Head of Equity Derivatives Research Stuart Kaiser said may still be ""need to be revised higher."" This would represent a sharp acceleration from the 50% year-on-year growth recorded during Q1’s earnings season.

A big part of the strong Q2 earnings growth is easy comparisons to the year-earlier period that represented the bottom of the Covid-19 earnings impact. But Q2 estimates also reflect genuine growth, with total index earnings expected to be up +8.8% compared to the pre-Covid 2019 Q2 period. In other words, even when compared to an earnings season 2 years ago, well before the coronavirus pandemic, this earnings season is expected to show very strong growth. Estimates for Q2 and beyond have been steadily going up, with the current +60.5% earnings growth rate up from +50.6% at the end of March and +41.6% at the start of January 2021.

Goldman Sachs strategist David Kosting said that market pariticpants should focus on three questions heading into this earnings season: (1) How will companies deal with rising material costs and supply chain disruptions? (2) How are companies planning to prioritize cash spending? (3) How will companies deal with policy uncertainties, especially surrounding a potential tax hike?

In addition to earnings season, market participants are also looking forward to Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell giving his semi-annual Monetary Policy Report to Congress Wednesday and Thursday of this week. Analysts are expecting Powell to once again strike a dovish tone (meaning unlikely to take aggressive action against inflation and instead favor employment), given the mixed June Job Report, which saw a better than expected number of jobs added to the economy but the unemployment rate tick higher and last week’s meeting minutes which showed an increasing divide between members regarding the timeline to begin tapering quantitative easing. In my view, Powell is trying to do three things in the upcoming meeting: (1) reiterate his view that the recovery of the economy is not yet complete, (2) inflation is a result of pandemic-era disruptions, and (3) prevent a repeat of the 2013 Taper Tantrum, an unwarranted, silly, collective market-panic that triggered a spike in U.S. Treasury yields after investors learned that the Federal Reserve was slowly putting the brakes on its quantitative easing program passed during the height of the 2008-09 recession. Moving ahead, further economic reports on consumer price inflation and retail sales out this week are expected to once again underscore that the pace of economic recovery in the US remains limited by supply chain disruptions and labor market imbalances.

Kathy Jones, chief fixed income strategist at Charles Schwab said, “I think the recovery is on track, it’s really just the rate of change that has slowed. We couldn’t continue to grow at 9-10% GDP growth every quarter, so obviously it’s going to slow down. I think one of the things that got into markets that got \[Treasury\] yields tumbling was maybe the fact that the Fed was going to hike rates sooner than anticipated. That sends a signal to the long end of the bond market that maybe the Fed isn;t going to tolerate higher inflation for longer and that they’re going to step on the brakes sooner rather than later ... we don't think that's going to be the case though. We think the economy is doing well, yields will probably bounce back."" I agree with this sentiment. 

**Highlights**

* Over the weekend, Richard Branson became the first civilian to go to space with his own company Virgin Galactic (SPCE), a remarkable milestone as companies like Bezos’ Blue Origin and Musk’s SpaceX intensify competition in space tourism.
* Despite successfully completing the trip, shares of Virgin Galactic (SPCE) fell more than 10% after the company announced it planned to take advantage of the elevated stock price by selling $500 million in stock.
* Tesla (TSLA) Chief Executive Elon Musk on Monday defended the electric-vehicle maker's purchase of SolarCity Corp. in court, telling a Delaware judge that he didn't act improperly during the negotiating process. This comes in response to a lawsuit filed by TSLA shareholders that allege Musk forced the company to buy SolarCity, a solar-cell manufacturer, in order to save his investment in the company. Frankly, this lawsuit seems a little ridiculous to me given SolarCity has proven a smart acquisition.
* Walt Disney (DIS) said on Sunday that “Black Widow”, the newest Marvel movie, made $80 million in theater sales, the largest domestic opening weekend since “Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker” in 2019, a strong sign that appetite to go to the movies remains high among Americans. Comparatively, “Black Widow” made $60 million through streaming purchases.
* In yet another crackdown of big-tech companies, Chinese regulators are reportedly set to order Tencent (TCEHY) to give up their exclusive rights to music labels and pay a small fine.
* Broadcom (AVGO) is reportedly in talks to by SAS Institute, a software company with upwards of $3 billion a year in revenue in a deal valued between $15-$20 billion. This is yet another acquisition by one of the world’s largest semiconductor companies.
* Microsoft (MSFT) announced it was acquiring cybersecurity firm RiskIQ to help reduce risk amid “the increasing sophistication and frequency of cyberattacks”.

Absent that, the Fed should be completely removed from the political sphere, its dual mandate replaced by a single mission to provide the nation with sound money.”

personalfinance,Should I refinance?,"Our house has skyrocketed in value, over 40% in the last 3 years. I'm wondering if we should refinance.

Current info:

House is valued at 220,000

We purchased it at 160,000, and owe 144,000 on the FHA loan. Current interest rate is 3.750

I pay 1075 each month and an additional 25 dollars on the principle each month. 

Of the 1075, 272 goes to the principle, 452 goes to interest, 353 goes to escrow for taxes and insurance, and we pay 78 dollars a month for PMI. 

  
We could pay up to 1200/month if it would pay it off more quickly. 

&amp;#x200B;

Do we look like good candidates for refinancing?

I'm also not sure because we may want to sell, take the 50k-ish and put a downpayment on a new home, which means refinancing would kind of be a waste, right?",finance
CryptoCurrency,Best Wallet for HODLing,"I’ve been HODLing BTC and ETH for the last few years in a Celsius wallet, and I’ve seen some posts recently about how they freeze your account from withdrawals and are a shady business.

Also, I have like $50-60 in CEL holdings as well, what can I do with those? Should I just leave those in there, and take the other coins out?",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Payoff Motorcycle loan?,"So, I have a Motorcycle loan at the moment. Its an $8000 bike I've been paying on for 2 years now and I have barely gotten anywhere (still owe $6300). Now, I didn't realize this until right now, as I've just had the payment coming out automattically and I barely notice it. 

I decided to check it out tonight and realized I've been pegged with a 10% interest rate so it's no wonder I'm spinning my wheels (pun intended). I'm very aware that I should have known what my interest rate was the day I signed for it but the first bike I bought had a 4% rate  so I assumed this one would be similar. I know, I know, assumptions. 

So, my question is, is it worth paying the thing off despite it knocking my account down a bit under what I like to keep? It's going to break my heart to put the $6300 down but it's not going to decimate me financially or anything. I think that's probably the right move but I'd like to hear some opinions from some people that might have a little better grasp on all of this stuff.

solar,Solar Panel Wall Idea?,"What I'd like and what will happen are two different things I'm sure.  


My apartment is pretty lax on things. Great Danes are allowed here, people can park boats in their parking spots, you can even smoke here (although not weed although it's legal rec and med, just not fed). Anywho, I asked for permission to build a wall for privacy and gardening on my patio slab, I should hear something soon but if after giving them enough details, I'm allowed, then I'd like to include solar.  


What I'd like to do is get one panel, idk the watt size yet but something big enough to matter for one panel. I'd like to set the panel up (I face roughly south south east with clear line of sight for the sun) so it's standing on one side and the panel's facing the parking lot. Around it I would be using reclaimed wood to hold it in place similar to a window. Hope to make it flush with everything too. With it, I hope to power all my gardening needs so this means pumps, lights, and whatever else I may need ran.  


How feasible is it to turn a solar panel into a wall pretty much so that I can collect solar energy but also  keep my privacy? What possible problems may arise from having the solar panel on the ground floor? It'd be near the grass but high enough to not be hit by a weed whacker I hope. High enough that it's not effected by snowfall.  What challenges might I face?",energy
personalfinance,Refinancing personal loans from debt consolidation,"Over the past year I have moved all of my credit card debt with interest rates around 21-24 % to personal loans of around 14-15%.  I've also paid off my car which allows me to pay extra towards the principal of my higher interest loans.  My credit score has increased quite a bit, and cheaper personal loan rates are available to me. I no longer use my credit cards and have been slowly building an emergency fund in addition to paying off  my loans.

Would it make sense to refinance my personal loans at a lower interest rate that is available to me since my credit score went up?",finance

Newly covered today: 

1. There is a new Cardano wallet being introduced by u/berry_ales from the Berry Pool. I have no idea if it will be good or bad at protecting your ADA. Just reporting that it exists.

2. There is currently a lawsuit challenging the notion that staking rewards should be taxed as income.  The plaintiff argues that newly created property isn’t taxed as income and that this should also apply to staking rewards.  Very relevant issue for Cardano delegators.

4. Professor Aggelos Kiayias recently dropped a video explaining exactly how Mithril (apparently neckbeard dungeon master talk for elf armor) is going to allow for Perfect Cardano (ADA) wallets that combine the ease of use and convenience of light wallets with the trustlessness of full node wallets. We also learned exactly how Mithril is going to work. [https://youtu.be/LhepJFCyWRk](https://youtu.be/LhepJFCyWRk)
5. In proof-of-work, bootstrapping can be done with blockheaders. This won’t do in proof-of-stake since we need information about stakeholder distribution to confirm block validity.
6. Mithril fixes this by being a cryptographic construction that enables a population of stakeholders to issue a signature consistent with certain constraints.
7. For Mithril to work in proof-of-stake, it needs three crucial properties: 1) it needs to enforce a threshold ratio of stakeholders before the signature is issued; 2) the pre-signature fragments must be independently verified and subject to public aggregation; and 3) it must be efficient in the sense that the final signature is of constant size and is logarithmically dependent on the # of stakeholders.
8. Stakeholders will issue special Mithril keys along with the normal cryptographic key material. Then at regular intervals, full nodes will test whether they can produce a pre-signature fragment. Only a random subset of stakeholders will be eligible to produce a pre-signature fragment. When a sufficient # of pre-signature fragments have been issued by eligible stakeholders then it will be possible to aggregate the fragments into a final signature.
9. This will be a checkpoint that will be verifiable with respect to previous check points all the way back to the genesis block. Such checkpoints will be cryptographic commitments of the relevant UTXOs.
10. Since the checkpoints will be trustless, a light client (i.e. wallet) will only need to verify the sequence of checkpoints up to the current time to trustlessly bootstrap.

54. It looks like the second biggest ETH stakepool or it's custody provider has lost it’s users private keys to $75MM in ETH. Cardano doesn’t have this problem. We get to keep custody of our crypto because we found a better way than slashing. [https://stakehound.com/blog-post/fireblocks-eth-2-key-management-incident/](https://stakehound.com/blog-post/fireblocks-eth-2-key-management-incident/) [https://twitter.com/JamesSpediacci/status/1407465311180255236](https://twitter.com/JamesSpediacci/status/1407465311180255236)

56. COTI (a project with very close ties to Cardano) is coming to Ledger. [https://medium.com/cotinetwork/coti-native-is-coming-to-ledger-c56b04df1253](https://medium.com/cotinetwork/coti-native-is-coming-to-ledger-c56b04df1253)
57. The June Cardano 360 is currently available on Youtube. [https://youtu.be/al5m14299ww](https://youtu.be/al5m14299ww)
58. We saw segments on various newer partner entities like Nervos, Orion Protocol, and Revuto. Nervos is a UTXO proof-of-work blockchain which is building a cross-chain bridge with Cardano so that you can use your ADA on Nervos dApps and vice versa. Interoperability is a big theme for Nervos and they plan to have a working testnet within a month. Orion Protocol is building a terminal that will allow for decentralized non-custodial trading across centralized and decentralized exchanges. They say this would not require you to KYC or even have an account with any of these exchanges. Revuto is an online subscription management service that recently completed a $10MM token sale on Cardano.
59. It was also revealed that Wolfram Labs, COTI, and IOHK have a three-way partnership (a ménage à tech) to build an NFT auction site. The people from Wolfram were talking about very interesting things including live minting during streaming events and automated upload to IPFS. COTI will be building out auction and bidding mechanisms in ADAPay.
60. Professor Aggelos Kiayias gave us an update on research including that Ouroboros Chronos and Hydra papers have both been accepted into conferences/journals. Chronos will provide Cardano with a global concept of time that doesn’t rely on any outside timekeeper. Prof. Kiayias also pointed out that Hydra is distinguishable from other layer two protocols in that the scripting language is identical to that of the base layer in Cardano such that any dApp that can run on Cardano will run on the Hydra L2. This is a huge plus and superior to many other layer two solutions in other ecosystems where the base layer dApps will not run on layer two. Finally, the Mithril paper has been submitted for peer review. It will provide Cardano light wallets with Succinct Non-interactive Arguments of Knowledge that will give us the best of both worlds: no delays for syncing as in full node wallets while still preserving trustlessness.
61. Finally, the Goguen Summit will be in late September. Sign up now at [summit.cardano.org](http://summit.cardano.org/).
62. The Fed is once again STRONGLY signalling to us that they are going to regulate stablecoins. The Fed is also specifically calling out Tether for the first time. You need to be thinking about how stablecoin regulation might affect your favorite Cardano DeFi or other project. [https://twitter.com/CaitlinLong\_/status/1408500265397985282](https://twitter.com/CaitlinLong_/status/1408500265397985282) [https://twitter.com/CaitlinLong\_/status/1408572624125534212](https://twitter.com/CaitlinLong_/status/1408572624125534212)
63. People are starting to realize that the Stakehound private key loss in ETH may attract unwanted regulatory attention to Ethereum 2.0 while this problem could never have occurred in Cardano. Also, only a few days later another ETH stakepool (this time SharedStake...the sixth biggest ETH Stakepool) allegedly experiences a rugpull that some are valuing at over $30MM. This is another problem that could not happen in Cardano staking. It feels like we stepped into the ring, they rang the bell, and ETH just started punching itself in the head. Eventually it’s going to KO itself.

79. Robert Kornacki of dcSpark releases an article on why every Cardano dApp will use NFTs. The article contains some very interesting discussion on smart contracts in the EUTXO context including language instructing that “UTXOs have smart contracts attached to them and not the other way around” and “\[...\]the simplest way to think about it is that when a UTXO is created it has the option to have a smart contract attached to it.” [https://medium.com/dcspark/every-eutxo-dapp-will-use-nfts-and-heres-why-fd87e6a8c9a6](https://medium.com/dcspark/every-eutxo-dapp-will-use-nfts-and-heres-why-fd87e6a8c9a6)

personalfinance,Is it better to pay more upfront or take out a larger loan?,"Hello! I’m highly considering taking out a high interest loan in order to purchase a share in a historic property. The cost of the share would be ~50k. I could put up 30k but it would all but drain my savings. Would it be better to drain the savings and aggressively pay back a 20k loan or take out a 50k loan, keep the savings and work on paying the loan back? Im very hesitant to take on such a large debt that would take ages to repay with a high interest rate but I don’t know how important it is to have savings. For context, I’m 24, have no current debts and have a pretty stable job although I guess stability isn’t really a guarantee with anything. Would it be better to take on more debt or drain my savings? How much could safely be drained ?",finance
personalfinance,Student loans advice needed.,"Hi everyone. I am here looking for advice as I am in unfamiliar territory. My middle child is set to start college in August. We have a unique situation. He did not qualify for much federal aid because of my ""assets"". Those assets are proceeds from life insurance as my husband passed away. This money is my safety net. 

We proceeded to apply for a student loan through Sallie Mae...I don't know anything about student loans.  When we got to the financial disclosure part, the cost of the loan was double what the actual loan amount was. It made me want to vomit. So, that being said, I guess I am just going to write the school a check due to time constraints. 

I would like to plan ahead for next year so any advice I could get would be greatly appreciated.

personalfinance,"[Question] I've always ""just banked"" with Chase, and wondering if I should make a change? Should Checking &amp; Savings Accounts be with the same bank? How are Nerd Wallet Recommendations?","Hey Everyone,

So I am relocating across the country and have never really paid attention to the bank we work with. I'm currently with Chase, which is obviously easy, they have abundant branches, and their mobile app is actually excellent in my experience. Obviously their interest rates are basically non-existent though.

That said, I don't know the last time i needed to go into a branch, it's been years, and I maybe use an ATM 2-3 times a year so the convenience of Chase being wide spread isn't so important in reality.

While evaluate who to move our banking to what should I be considering? Is it as simple as just go with the bank/credit union that have the highest APY? If so, I also noticed per Nerd Wallet's recommendations that the banks with the highest APY for Checking accounts are not necessarily the banks with the best APY for their Saving's accounts...

&amp;#x200B;

Should I consider having the checking and savings account with different banks?

Is there a benefit to having both accounts within the same bank?

Is there a benefit to NOT having both accounts in the same bank?

EDIT: Nerd Wallet recommends a credit union that offers a 2.09% APY that can go up to 4.09% APY if you qualify, which I do... Is there a reason I should not move to this bank? Also if the checking APY is greater than any savings account APY should I keep all the money in this checking account?

stocks,($SFL) - Q2 2021 Forecast,"##**Abstract**

Due to precipitous increases in container and dry-bulk shipping spot-rates, it is my belief that SFL will dramatically outperform analyst consensus estimates of $0.19/share earnings in Q2 2021. My model indicates they will achieve $0.27 on a recurring basis, up over 50% when compared to the previous quarter, and a dividend increase is very likely to occur as a result. My price target for SFL is $12/share following its earnings announcement in August.

For more a more detailed analysis on what is driving this growth, check out my recent submission history for the Q1 report.

##**Summary of Estimates**

Total charter hire of $145M in Q2 vs $135M in Q1.

Recurring earnings of $30.9M (~$0.27) in Q2 vs $20.4M (~$0.18/share) in Q1.

Non-cash/non-recurring earnings of $5.0M in Q2 vs $11.1M in Q1.

Total combined earnings of $35.9M (~$0.31/share) in Q2 vs $31.5M (~$0.27/share) in Q1.

**Liners**

Q2 estimated hire of $76.3M vs $74.4M in Q1
Inclusive of $2.3M estimated Q2 profit share vs $2.4M in Q1

Increase attributable to higher rates for 2 container feeders and 2 car carriers trading in the spot market. Decreased profit share due to declining scrubber fuel spread.

**Bulkers**

Q2 estimated hire $41.6M of vs $31.9M in Q1
45% of charter hire coming from ships operating in the spot markets.

Increase attributable to 7 handysize bulkers and 3 supramax bulkers trading in the spot market, and 8 capesize bulkers on time charters with profit share.

**Tankers**

Q2 estimated hire of $15.2M vs $15.3M in Q1
Inclusive of $0.3M estimated profit share in both quarters

Decrease attributable to slightly lower rates for 2 Suezmax tankers and declining scrubber fuel spread.

**Rigs**

Q2 estimated hire of $12.2M vs $13.2M in Q1

Decrease attributable to forbearance agreement that captures only ~75% of charter hire. Agreement was signed midway through Q1 and $12.2M/quarter is expected until Seadrill concludes its restructuring. Note that $4.1M/quarter is accruing in escrow and will be released following the Seadrill restructuring.

##**NonRecurring/NonCash Items**

**Securities**

We estimate a gain of $2.6MM on marketable securities due in Q2. This is entirely driven by appreciation of 1.4M shares held in Frontline. SFL may have sold these shares during Q2, but a likelier scenario is that the forward purchasing agreement was extended, as the shares are being borrowed against.

SFL’s other bonds and securities are likely to have appreciated as they are oil-related, but are also highly illiquid and difficult to value.

**Swaps &amp; Derivatives**

It is difficult to find accurate pricing history on all of the swaps and forward exchange contracts that SFL holds. With that said, I estimate an approximate $2-3MM appreciation on swaps and derivative contracts. Note that any gains on swaps or forwards are non-cash and will be offset by increased debt payments over the duration of the contract. Valuation of forwards is expected to increase based on announcement of aggressive rate hikes by Norges bank beginning in September, offset partially by a more aggressive timetable for rate hikes by the US Federal Reserve and appreciation of the dollar relative to the Norwegian Kroner.

**Other items**

Gain on repurchase of debt and a small reduction in the credit-loss provision is likely, but not estimated.

I hold long positions in derivatives related to SFL. I am not an investment advisor or finance professional, nor have I held experience in a related position.",finance

CryptoCurrency,Passive income in crypto,"You can earn money on cryptocurrencies in other ways. This can be both passive and active income. In addition to the well-known trading, active income includes such activities as arbitration, participation in IDO and Airdrop.

So, in the cryptocurrency industry, there are the following main types of passive income:

**1. Mining** 👷 ♂ ️ - I think many of you know or have heard about mining. For those who do not know what mining is, I will not describe it now. Search for information on Google. But I will say my opinion: the threshold for entering mining is too high. You need to buy equipment, configure it, maintain it, etc. Even if you have technically figured out how to mine, reducing the economy to profit is also not the easiest task. In a word, I do not recommend it. It is difficult, expensive and not the fact that you will earn. What cryptocurrencies can be mined: BTC, ETH, LTC, DOGE, and other PoW (Proof-of-Work) coins.

&amp;#x200B;

**2. Staking**🏦 - like mining, it is also a type of reward for the blockchain network for confirming transactions. However, unlike mining, staking is much easier and more affordable! The principle is very simple. You ""freeze"" your cryptocurrency on the network, in exchange for an interest rate of 5 to 20% per annum on your account. If very superficially, we can say that this is a kind of dividend. The percentage of these ""dividends"" depends on the cryptocurrency and the period of freezing of your funds. Moreover, you receive interest not in dollars, but in the very cryptocurrency that you are staking. That is, having by staking 100 DOT with a rate of 13%, in a year you will have 113 DOT.

Staking is a great option for those who are going to hold a particular cryptocurrency for years. As a result, your capital will grow not only due to the fact that the currency will grow in price but also due to the fact that the number of coins in your wallet will also increase.

What cryptocurrencies can be staked: ETH 2.0, DOT, ADA, SOL, LUNA, FTM, and other PoS (Proof-of-Stake) coins.

&amp;#x200B;

3. **DeFi loans** 💸 are another good way to passively earn money in crypto. It works very simply. You are borrowers of money on a DeFi platform such as AAVE and Compound, for which you of course receive interest. Usually, stablecoins like USDT, USDC, and others have the highest percentages. And if you do not want to invest in ordinary cryptocurrencies, which are subject to the risks of constant price jumps, then as an option, you can buy stablecoins, which always cost $1, and lend them out for 8-10% per annum. It may seem to you that this is not much. Now, attention, in the United States, the average annual interest rate on savings accounts is a negligible 0.5%. Tin, tell me? 😂

&amp;#x200B;

4. **Liquidity pool mining and yield farming** 🤯 - I usually say ""it's not as difficult as it sounds"", but this is not the case. These types of passive earnings are very complex, risky and there is nothing for a beginner to do in them. But at the same time, if they are done correctly and wisely, these are the most profitable types of passive income in crypto. Sometimes the annual interest rate is calculated in thousands of percent. But as I have already said, there are more risks here.",cryptocurrency

My house is now valued at around $350k, and that's before taking into account the new roof, new floors, fenced in back yard, and a few other misc. improvements.

Our interest rate is 3.625. We talked to one lender who said that refinancing would knock our interest rate to 3.5 and our PMI would drastically decrease due to the increased home value. We would go from payments of $2100/month (mortgage, PMI, taxes) down to $1895/month.

I've looked at the amortizations schedules, and it seems that the new loan will actually be cheaper over the course of 30 years, and I believe that we intend to stay for most, if not all of that.

It seems obvious to me that it sounds like the right move. However, we plan to install new siding and windows next summer. Would it be worthwhile to wait on the home improvements to refi, or take the major increase in home value now? Thanks to all for any input.",finance

I currently have retirement funds spread across a few different accounts--I have a Roth TSP and traditional TSP account with the federal government, as a federal employee. I also have a Roth IRA and trad IRA.

I currently make under 125k MAGI, and thus I contribute the max each year to my Roth IRA, though I'm getting close to that limit and want to understand my options for backdoor conversions for when I exceed it. My traditional IRA, however, has a fairly small amount in it (~$8k). It's basically the result of me rolling over my 401k funds from only the very first job I ever worked, and then one time a few years ago, when my income was low enough that I could deduct traditional IRA contributions on my taxes, I added another $1200 to it to make it so I received a slight refund on my taxes that year rather than owing a small amount. But otherwise I've just keep it invested and haven't touched it.

I understand that in order to do a backdoor Roth conversion, you need to have no pre-tax funds in your traditional IRA whatsoever. The TSP allows you to roll over traditional IRA funds into an existing account, so I have the option to move all my trad IRA money into my TSP account.

My question then is this--if I rollover those trad IRA funds so that they're in a TSP (i.e. 401k) plan, and then I have NO trad IRA funds to my name whatsoever, could I then do backdoor Roth conversions? Am I in the clear? Would I need to close the current trad IRA account once it's empty, then open a new one? Or am I barred from ever doing a backdoor Roth because at one point, I did have a traditional IRA with pretax money in it?

CryptoCurrency,How and where to Yield farm on Ethereum (earn passive income with your crypto),"Today, anyone with good amounts of crypto laying around is losing potential gains when not putting it into action. There are multiple ways to earn passive income with your Assets. What's incredible with DeFi and lending platforms, is that you can easily take loans (**nearly** risk-free depending on what you deposit as collateral) to earn even more on other platforms. Here, i'm going to give you exemples on how to earn with your crypto on ethereum's defi apps. Note that there are many more ways to earn on your crypto than written below. **This post is limited to what I have tried/ am still doing.**

# DeFi Yield farming isn't the same as Staking and depositing crypto on platforms like Blockfi/Celcius/Nexo

First, you gotta understand the difference between them. Staking is when you deposit crypto into a contract or a staking pool to become a block validator. You are rewarded for verifying blocks and securing the underlying chain. (You can stake ADA, ETH2, ALGO... and earn in the form of these coins)

It's also different from using services like Blockfi/Celcius/Nexo. These are businesses. They hold your crypto and have control over it. Usually, they borrow your crypto to leverage traders who usually short/long the market. Borrowers pay fees to these platforms and you get a part of the profit. Using these platforms to earn passive income on your crypto can be advantageous if you have relatively ""low"" amounts of crypto. You won't have to pay a lot in gas fees which inevitably comes at pretty high in Defi. Thing is, DeFi returns (APY) can be way higher than what these businesses offer.

Yield farming is simply using DeFi applications in multiple differents ways (with or without leverage) to periodically harvest rewards. Here's a list of exemples :

* Earning interest on your crypto when depositing into lending protocols
* Providing liquidity to liquidity pools to earn liquidity mining rewards (this is what pays the best)
* Earning governance tokens for participating on yield farming programs with new projects

# Barriers to entry

**Gas fees** : Obviously, not everyone will be able to yield farm. **Most** yield farming techniques will need 2 transactions to set everything up, and later on 2 more transactions to withdraw everything you earned. You gotta take into account that most of these transactions are also complex and cost more than your average ethereum transaction.

Here you can see what are the current gas prices : [https://etherscan.io/gastracker](https://etherscan.io/gastracker) (most defi transactions costs around the same as "" Uniswap Add/Remove LP "" )

""Why aren't you talking about DeFi on the Binance Smart Chain? Fees are cheaper!"": Well yes, it's cheaper, but it's also riskier. First the blockchain by itself is centralised under Binance control. Only 21 validators are validating blocks, so you can hardly call that ""Decentralized-finance"". Secondly, the BSC is a breeding ground for scams and shitty protocols since building on there is cheap. Most of projects on there are copy-paste of ethereum apps done by shitty devs. Yes, there are good projects on there like the VENUS protocol and PancakeSWAP, but nothing compared to what you can find on Ethereum.

**You will need Ether/ERC-20 tokens** : All of this happens on the Ethereum blockchain. To pay for transactions, you will need Ether. Also, only ERC-20 tokens/ether will be compatible with defi apps mentionned below.

**Complex yield farming techniques are the real earners**: Theses techniques (which usually requires 2-3 transactions to set up) usually pay the most (up to 70% APY), yet most users are already priced out from yield farming this way. Because of that, most easy and cheap ways to earn passive income are worse than simply using Blockfi/Celcius/Nexo.

# Risks

**Smart-Contract risks :** Everything here is backed and working through smart contracts. You have to believe in the code and you will need to trust security audits. Even though most of dapps mentionned here are extremely safe, risks are non-zero. Exploits could be found. I recommend you look at the ""Risks"" documentation of different protocols. Exemple : [AAVE](https://docs.aave.com/risk/), [Convexfinance](https://docs.convexfinance.com/convexfinance/faq/risks)...

**Using leverage is risky :** Depositing collateral to borrow crypto and then yield farm with it is extremely risky. If you borrow too much, you risk getting liquidated and lose your collateral. If a market crash happens, your loans might get undercollaterized and get you liquidated, you have to pay attention to the market. Best collateral to use are stablecoins such as USDC/USDT/DAI because they technically won't lower in value, thus never leave you undercollaterized (when also borrowing stablecoins). Even though Ether/LINK are great collaterals (you can borrow up to 80% of your ether value on AAVE) they are prone to market volatility. If you put up 1 ethereum as collateral right now (2k$) and then borrow 1000$ in USDT. If  ethereum goes to 1250$, your 1 ether gets liquidated and you get to keep the 1000 USDT (thus losing you a good chunk of money). You can always repay that loan or deposit more collateral to keep your loan healthy. **CONSIDER THIS RISK PLEASE!**

# ""Cheap"" ways to earn in Defi (without leverage)

Here I will list easy ways to start earning on your crypto in Defi with only one transaction (to deposit, you'll need a second one to withdraw). I **want to add here that the ""beauty"" of yield farming comes from using leverage, more on that later.**

**Depositing your crypto in Yearn vaults :** On [yearn.finance](https://yearn.finance/vaults) , you can simply deposit your ERC-20 token or Ether into their vaults to earn passively. These vaults are smart contracts (no entity have control over your funds) following different strategies to grow their value through defi. They kinda are yield aggregators, chasing the best returns for you. You deposit, it grows, you cash out more. It takes only one transaction, its safe, but returns are pretty low. (USDC currently has 4.6% yearly growth).

**Participating in** [**Universe.xyz**](https://dao.universe.xyz/yield-farming) **governance token distribution :** This is a new DAO (decentralised autonomous organisation) developping an NFT marketplace and sometimes doing NFT drops. Currently, they are distributing some of their governance tokens (can be compared to the UNI token) to yield farmers. You only need to deposit one of these tokens : AAVE, COMP, SNX, LINK (currently one of the best way to earn for LINK holders),BOND,SUSHI,ILV. You will receive their token on a weekly basis according to your share of the pool.

**Depositing your crypto on** [AAVE](https://app.aave.com/markets)**/**[Compound](https://compound.finance/markets) These protocols give you rewards when depositing in their lending pools. They give you currently 3% to 6% on stablecoins (this includes rewards in AAVE/COMP tokens). This can be relatively low compared to the likes of BlockFi and Celcius, but like I said, the biggest returns aren't really in the most easy/straight forward methods.

**Depositing in Bancor's liquidity pools (my personnal favorite)** : [Bancor.network](https://Bancor.network) currently have a liquidity mining program incentivising people to provide liquidity to their pools. They provide impermanant loss protection and offers the possibility to provide only to one side of a liquidity pool, but there is also a cap on the amount of tokens than can be deposited. (Note that these pools are extremely popular, you might have to snipe a spot). If you have BNT tokens, you can currently earn up to 63% APY in the LINK/BNT pool. If you manage to snipe a spot and deposit LINK tokens, you will earn up to 13% APY in there.

# A bit pricier, 2 steps needed

**Using** [**Curve.finance**](https://Curve.finance) **rewards system to earn yield (without leverage) :** Curve is a decentralized exchange, just like Uniswap and Bancor. To incentivise users to use their platform, they rewards liquidity providers with CRV token rewards. I'll give you an exemple for the LINK token. Once you deposit your LINK in their Link pool, you will be given linkCRV tokens (usually 1:1 ratio). There, you are simply earning a part of the pool generated fees (which is kinda low ngl) Now, to actually start earning the CRV rewards, to will need to ""stake"" those linkCRV tokens (by placing them in gauge). Curve let's you decide if you want to lock those tokens or not. If you lock them for a long period of time, your rewards will be boosted. But there is a way to get most of these rewards without having to lock your deposit for 4 years. [Convexfinance.com](https://Convexfinance.com) vaults let you deposit your linkCRV to earn the full amount of rewards with a full boost without the timelock! (they keep a percentage of rewards though). So there, you are earning about 10% APY in crv tokens on your LINK. [Yearn.finance](https://Yearn.finance) also have vaults like these. The best paying vaults right now is the Tricrypto vault. Deposit your USDT or ETH or WBTC in the [curve.finance](https://curve.finance) tricrypto pool to receive crvTricrypto tokens, earning you 2% APY in pool fees. Then you can then deposit these crvTricrypto tokens in a vault to earn up to 20% APY.

# Where the fun begins, using leverage through AAVE/Compound

The point of using leverage when yield farming is to borrow crypto at a low interest rate, then put that crypto into action using differents way to earn a higher APY (thus paying the loan and earning the difference as profit). Everything that was written previously could be done with Leverage, let me explain.

**Figuring out how much your loan will cost**

If you have Ether/LINK/stablecoins laying around, you could deposit them onto AAVE. Already, you will start earning (about 1% APY for ETH, 3% to 6% on stablecoins). What's amazing about AAVE, is that they reward you with stAAVE token **even when you are borrowing**!  So, after putting up collateral, you could take out a Loan in Ether or maybe a stablecoin. Borrowing rates are variable, but currently they are pretty low. 

If you borrow USDT, the interest rate is currently at 3.80% yearly, but the twist is that you are also receiving 3.50% APY in rewards when borrowing. So your loan technically currently costs 0.30%. If you add the fact that you are receiving income from your collateral deposits (1% for ETH), you are already making money! Congratz, you borrowed money and you are currently getting paid for it! (Note these rates might change in the future).

**Yield farming**

1. Assuming you are keeping your loan healthy, you now need to find how to beat the cost of your loan. With your borrowed USDT you could very well deposit it in the Tricrypto pool on [curve.finance](https://curve.finance) like I wrote previously, earning you about 2% in fees +20% in CRV rewards for depositing your crvTricrypto in the [yearn.finance](https://yearn.finance) vault. Currently, that would earn you about 22% APY in total for this method. You just have to calculate if that's worth it depending on gas fees.
2.  RISKY : You could also buy BNT tokens with that USDT and deposit your coins for 2 months in one of its pools earning you 60%+ APY. **Be careful though**, if the markets dumps again, you will struggle to pay back your loan which will remain stable! A bit safer way to do this is to borrow ether and buy BNT with that instead. Since most of the crypto market follow the same trend, the value (in $) of your loan might follow more closely the value of the tokens you bought.
3. You could take part in the Rainmaker liquidity mining program on the [dmm.exchange](https://dmm.exchange/#/farms) (that's what I'm doing right now). You borrow USDT, then provide liquidity in the ETH/USDT pool (you will need to have more Ether on the sidelines because you need to provide liquidity to both side of the pair). Then you stake the coin received (the  ETH-USDT LP token) to receive KNC rewards. This currently earns about 38% APY in pools fees with KNC rewards. This is great because if your loan is starting to get risky, you can always cash out your deposit and simply repay your loan. Risk here is potential impermanant loss. Here's a tool to calculate your potential impermanent loss : [https://dailydefi.org/tools/impermanent-loss-calculator/](https://dailydefi.org/tools/impermanent-loss-calculator/) (If ETH goes up in value, when withdrawing you will receive less eth than deposited but more USDT, if ETH goes down in value, it's the other way around)

Notes : there are multiple ways to approach these techniques. You need to find which coins to provide as collateral, find which coins you want to borrow, then find which place to earn the best yields following your risk tolerence and more. You can't just YOLO in something like this, you gotta calculate your potential rewards because gas fees are no joke. Don't bother borrowing/depositing in curve and then depositing in yearn if you only have about 500$ in Ether. Do your calculations and your research. There are tons of possibilities out there.

You will need the Metamask web extention to access these apps.

solar,Is solar using a HELOC a no-brainer?,"Looking at a quote I received last year, it would cost about $20K after incentives to install a solar system that would offset somewhere between 70-80% of my usage and electric costs.

Looking at my bank's HELOC calculator online, for me to pull $20K in equity at current interest rates would cost about $65 per month.


I could easily float the extra installed costs until I receive all rebates and tax credits early next year.

stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Tuesday, July 13, 2021","**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, July 13, 2021**

Today was quite action-packed, with both the S&amp;amp;P 500 (SPY) and tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) once again recording a fresh intraday high for the second time this week before turning lower towards the end of the session. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, performed the worst, falling 1.75% at the time of writing. Market participants are digesting the beginning of Q2 earning season and a new report that showed in June, consumer prices have surged by the most since 2008.

The Labor Department’s June Consumer Price Index (CPI), which measures changes in the prices of consumer goods, rose 0.9% in June, accelerating from May’s 0.6%. Year-on-year, the CPI is up 5.4%, exceeding the 4.9% expected by economists and the fastest rate of growth since 2008. Core CPI, which excludes the volatile price of energy and food and is therefore considered a more accurate representation of general price inflation, was up 4.5% year-on-year as prices bounced from last year’s pandemic-era lows.

While the CPI print is not ideal, the market’s somewhat muted reaction (though there was a little volatility) seems to confirm that market participants are increasingly pricing in higher-than-expected inflationary data and are buying into the Federal Reserve’s argument that current pressures are transitory and due to pandemic-related disruptions. Moreover, it is very important to consider that current inflationary data is calculated on a year-on-year basis, so base effects are very much inflating the current numbers. In other words, inflationary readings are high because they are being measured using numbers from June 2020 when prices across the board collapsed as lockdowns and social distancing policies were implemented across the world. As I have said many times in the past, I am personally not yet worried about current inflationary pressures translating into a prolonged cycle of higher prices, though one always has to acknowledge the risks in the market and be prepared to act. 

In other news, Q2 earnings seasons kicked off today, with two of the largest banks in the US, JP Morgan Chase (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS) both reporting today, as well as Pepsi (PEP). JP Morgan, which is often considered a bellwether for the US economy given its sheer size, reported great results, driven in part by the release of $3 billion the bank had set aside to protect against potential losses from default loans during the pandemic, a sign that consumers held up better than the bank expected. JPM recorded revenues of $31.4 billion and profits of $11.948 billion, a staggering improvement from profits of $4.687 billion a year ago. One downside from the earnings report is a sharp reduction in revenues produced from trading, which is not surprising given the insane run by the market in 2020. 

This quarter, earnings for companies in the SPY are expected to grow by 64% year-on-year, according to FactSet, which would mark the fastest rate of earnings growth since the fourth quarter of 2009, when the US was emerging from the 2008 housing-bubble induced recession. 

A big part of the strong Q2 earnings growth is easy comparisons to Q2 2020, a period that represented the bottom of the Covid-19 earnings impact. But Q2 2021 estimates also reflect genuine growth, with total index earnings expected to be up +8.8% compared to the pre-Covid 2019 Q2 period. In other words, even when compared to an earnings season 2 years ago, well before the coronavirus pandemic, this earnings season is expected to show very strong growth. Estimates for Q2 and beyond have been steadily going up, with the current +60.5% earnings growth rate up from +50.6% at the end of March and +41.6% at the start of January 2021.

Goldman Sachs strategist David Kosting said that market participants should focus on three questions heading into this earnings season: (1) How will companies deal with rising material costs and supply chain disruptions? (2) How are companies planning to prioritize cash spending? (3) How will companies deal with policy uncertainties, especially surrounding a potential tax hike?

In addition to earnings season, market participants are also looking forward to Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell giving his semi-annual Monetary Policy Report to Congress Wednesday and Thursday of this week. Analysts are expecting Powell to once again strike a dovish tone (meaning unlikely to take aggressive action against inflation and instead favor employment), given the mixed June Job Report, which saw a better than expected number of jobs added to the economy but the unemployment rate tick higher and last week’s meeting minutes which showed an increasing divide between members regarding the timeline to begin tapering quantitative easing. In my view, Powell is trying to do three things in the upcoming meeting: (1) reiterate his view that the recovery of the economy is not yet complete, (2) inflation is a result of pandemic-era disruptions, and (3) prevent a repeat of the 2013 Taper Tantrum, a unwarranted, silly, collective market-panic that triggered a spike in U.S. Treasury yields after investors learned that the Federal Reserve was slowly putting the brakes on its quantitative easing program passed during the height of the 2008-09 recession. Moving ahead, further economic reports on consumer price inflation and retail sales out this week are expected to once again underscore that the pace of economic recovery in the US remains limited by supply chain disruptions and labor market imbalances.

**Highlights**

* Shares of Disney (DIS) outperformed the market again today thanks to the great success of Marvel’s “Black Widow”, which generated $80 million* in theater sales and $60 million* in streaming sales, the best domestic opening for a movie since the pandemic began. 
* Tesla (TSLA) Chief Executive Elon Musk defended the electric-vehicle maker's purchase of SolarCity Corp. in court, telling a Delaware judge that he didn't act improperly during the negotiating process. This comes in response to a lawsuit filed by TSLA shareholders that allege Musk forced the company to buy SolarCity, a solar-cell manufacturer, in order to save his investment in the company.
* Netflix and Universal have reached a licensing deal that will see more Universal movies, including animated pictures from DreamWorks, available on its streaming platform. 
* Despite successfully completing the company's first trip with Richard Branson as a passenger, shares of Virgin Galactic (SPCE) remain under pressure after the company announced it planned to take advantage of the elevated stock price by selling $500 million in stock, with the stock down roughly 25% from Friday’s prices. 
* Broadcom (AVGO) is reportedly in talks to buy the SAS Institute, a software company with upwards of $3 billion a year in revenue in a deal valued between $15-$20 billion. This is yet another acquisition by one of the world’s largest semiconductor companies.
* Microsoft (MSFT) announced it was acquiring cybersecurity firm RiskIQ to help reduce risk amid “the increasing sophistication and frequency of cyberattacks”.
* SolarWinds says that unknown hackers exploited a previously unknown flaw in two of its programs to go after ""a limited, targeted set of customers."" The company went on to say the hack was “completely unrelated” to last year’s attack” and that the company was still “unaware of the identity of the potentially affected customers”. Seems like hackers find it easy to attack this company.

personalfinance,Should I freeze my accounts?,"I got home on Monday morning and there was a box for a gigantic dog crate in my living room. My roommate and I only have cats so I thought maybe she ordered it for whatever reason, but she said that it was addressed to me. My name, address, and phone number are on the shipping label and the box was delivered by FedEx. I called FedEx this morning and was able to find out that it was sent from a company in Columbus, Ohio called Pet360. I live in Georgia. Google says that that location of Pet360 is permanently closed and that the company was acquired by Chewy a while back, and I do have an account on Chewy but haven't ordered anything in over a month. So I called Chewy and the person I spoke to said they don't carry anything by the brand that made the dog crate. I've checked my bank accounts a few times since yesterday and there's no missing money or weird activity anywhere. 

This definitely sounds odd and probably trivial. But I'm concerned that I was sent a large, probably expensive item was sent from an out of state pet shop that doesn't exist anymore, and I'm concerned about what it could mean for my security.",finance
personalfinance,How much does DTI impact likelihood of being accepted for a credit card?,"I was at some point in the next couple years wanting to apply for the costco anywhere credit card, citi doublecash card, and us bank cash + card. I know all of those require good credit.

My credit is just shy of 700. For whatever reason it says my oldest credit card account isn't old enough despite my only credit card being a decade old at this point that I've been using and I've never missed a payment, not even once. My biggest concern is that I have VERY HIGH student debt (six figures) because of an advanced degree.

I have a nice paying job and my loans are federal so I'm going into ibr and only paying around $500-600 in student loans a month. I'm just worried if I'll get rejected because my DTI will still be too high. The advice of simply paying off my loans faster will not affect my DTI because of my loan repayment plan is based on my income not amount of debt I have. I don't want to be stuck with just one credit card forever but I also don't want to apply for some other credit card that won't have good rewards.",finance

CryptoCurrency,My experience trying to rationalize with garbagecoin fanatics,"So there's this really shitty coin, its whole deal is that they're gonna make a $200 bottle of rum with it and incorporate an NFT into the bottle and somehow that's good for the coin. 

Anyways, I dig into their official website linked from the coin page and they have an address and phone number listed to look legit! I tried calling the number for about a week straight, no voicemail, no answer and it's not even a CA area code....so I check the address they listed on Google maps. No logo on the building, but there are company cars with a logo on their cars so I google the company name on the car and it turns out that it's actually their company who is using the building and not the distillery. I call their business to confirm. 

I relayed this over to the guys on satoshiSB (I've never bought a shitcoin guys I swear) and what followed was both insane and hilarious. Obvious attacks from all around. We're commenting back and forth with me stating stuff like ""they're selling $200 bottles of rum and have never made rum before in their life"" ""they're blatantly lying about owning a distillery ect...""

One guy gets so fed up that he PM's me and comments multiple times that he wants to set up a fight, like legit he kept trying to act tough and make it happen ""I'll drive out anywhere in northern CA"" ""come to Irvine"" ""meet me at my gym"" ect...

One of the mods of the subreddit for that specific crypto even PM'd me this exact message:

personalfinance,Cash out refinance with parsonage income,"My parents (around 70) are wondering if it's a good idea to refinance \~50% of the value of their home with the prospect of repaying the mortgage using parsonage income. Here are the details:

* Total annual household income: $70k. No debt, but also not any real savings or retirement or life insurance policies.
* Home value estimate is $450k, completely paid off.

The idea is to cash out between 200k and 250k on a 10 or 15 year (hopefully around 3% interest) loan, then pay the mortgage with parsonage income. The amount that would go to pay the mortgage (\~$25k annually) is currently being saved, so they're thinking that in a way this would immediately be cashing out what they can save over the next 10 years at a low interest rate (if that makes sense).

Additionally, my dad is a rabbi so home expenses can be taken as parsonage tax free, so this would lower their annual taxable income significantly and they can save there as well (according to my quick calculations, maybe about $3000 per year).

One extra wrinkle is that my parents are currently both around 70 years old. Being that they have no retirement, it's an extra reason to possibly cash out. On the other hand, there's concern about repaying the loan over its duration. The plan would be to continue to receive a salary (at least enough to pay the mortgage) for the duration of the loan, which they expect to do barring a tragedy (my dad is also the director of the organization). Obviously it's impossible to know what happens 10+ years into the future.

You can see that the details aren't fully sketched out yet, but the general concept is there. Do you guys think this is a worthwhile idea or should they leave the house alone and not jeopardize their equity? Or is more information or research necessary?

Thank you for your help!",finance

My question is, do you think after all the government stimulus, bank loans, mortgage backed securities wear off,  could we return to pre-pandemic “normal” earnings levels, which would constitute a 30-50% loss in major indexes?

personalfinance,Retirement advice for mid 30s,"I’ve been a long time lurker and learned a lot. I’m reaching out for some guidance around my specific situation. I recently turned 33 and looking to aggressively start saving into retirement plans for my family and I’s future. 

I’m a fairly high earner around $220k/yr depending on bonuses. My wife is a stay at home mom with our new baby. She might go back to work but for the time being there hasn’t been a big need as my income serves us ok. We have a home that we bought a few years back and just refinanced to cut over 2% off from the interest rate which has saved us another $900 a month. We have all student loans and all other debt paid off. We use our credit cards for all purchases but pay them off every month and they are used mostly to get the reward points. We have saved about 6-12 months worth of liquid in checking and savings accounts. 

Now the question comes around how to start saving/investing for retirement. I have a employer 401k but they do not match. I also have an old rollover 401k that has a few thousand. Below is what I was planning:

1. Start maxing out the 401k yearly. 
2. Talked with Fidelity last night on my rollover and went 100% into FDEWX


I was then going to contribute the yearly $6000 into the rollover IRA but started reading about traditional IRAs not being ideal and potential double tax on the contributions etc. That gave me some apprehension and I decided to ask for thoughts here. Since my income is high I do not qualify for a Roth IRA and my contributions to the rollover/traditional IRA would not be tax deductible. 

Is it still worth it to contribute the $6k into the rollover or what should I be doing to set my family and I for success? I know I’m behind on retirement but hoping I can aggressively start to fix it ASAP. Thanks for reading this and providing advice.",finance

They have already gave me a closing date, interest rate and everything.

personalfinance,Can I lose money to taxes by taking a raise?,"I am learning about long-term capital gains taxes. According to [this](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/101515/comparing-longterm-vs-shortterm-capital-gain-tax-rates.asp) resource, your long-term capital gains taxes are determined by your total taxable income for the year. So, if you earn less than $40,000 in a year, you pay long-term capital gains taxes at a 0% rate, but if you earn over $40,000, you pay long-term capital gains taxes at a 15% rate. Does this mean that if I earn just under $40,000 and then get a small raise, I could end up paying a lot more in taxes? (See example below.)



*Example*: I work an hourly wage job and make $34,999/year. I also have stock that I have held for over a year in a taxable (non-retirement) account. I earned $5,000 from the sale of this stock earlier this year. My total taxable income for this year is $34,999 + 5,000 = $39,999.  
Since I held the stock for more than a year, I have to pay long-term capital gains tax. Since my total taxable income is less than $40,000, I owe no taxes on the gain from the sale of the stock. I *do* owe taxes on my regular income of $34,999. This amounts to $4,000.88 ($995 + 12%). So, my total federal tax bill for the year is $4,000.88.  
I have been offered a $2/year raise. This would bring my income from my hourly wage job up to $35,001 and my total taxable income for the year to $40,001. I still owe regular income taxes on my regular income, totaling $4001.12. However, since my income is over $40,000, I now have to pay 15% long-term capital gains tax on the stock I sold. 15% of $5,000 is $750. So, now my total tax bill for the year is $4,751.12, which is $750.24 over the original tax bill. This means that by taking a $2/year raise, I have to pay $750.24 more in taxes.

personalfinance,Trying to plan out my future as I enter adulthood and try to set myself off on the right path to success.,"Hey Reddit,

I'm about to turn 17 years old and I have a lot that I want to achieve while I'm young but I'm not sure how to or where to start. Personally, the lifestyle I want doesn't necessarily have to be all that, but I'm really worried about cost of living (especially in California, I have to stay through college due to CalVet benefits) so I want to be ahead of the game and prepared for that. Eventually I might move, location isn't really definite as I want to be a commissioned air force officer. I won't have any student debt (maybe a little but probably not much) and I'm going to be living with family during college or until I can support myself. Here's a list of things I'd like to achieve ASAP or by my early 30s in no particular order:

* Get an internship at a bank this year for experience to put on my resume/college applications (my high school has a program for this)
* Establish credit as soon as I turn 18 (shouldn't be difficult; just small monthly payments)
* Start dropshipping common household items
* Create a small business out of something I love (later in life when I have the time and money)
* Buy commercial real estate (specifically self serve car washes, laundromats, storage rentals, **basically methods of passive income**) 
* Do ROTC and become an officer for the Air Force for 4 years then go into the reserves
* Finish college in 4 years by the age of 25 (maybe 30? I believe CalVet timelines are extended if you are a veteran)
* Work my way up to a managerial position at McDonald's by 18 and stay **only for college** (good for resume, I'm currently a crew trainer and I've worked there for 8 months)
* Get a 9-5 as an IRS Criminal Investigator or work with the FDIC, some sort of federal job regarding forensic finance **after college** (not even a high ranking position, just getting into the field. Hoping to maybe achieve a GS-12 ranking by late 30s?)
* Attain more real estate income preferably outside of California since it's a literal shithole
* Invest in stocks, crypto, etc.
* Invest in education outside of college
* Max out my Roth IRA/other savings plans via military or federal job
* Learn about compounded interest and get a good grasp on it as well as learn how to maximize it

Is this realistic? I know it's going to be a lot of hard work but I want to have a strong foundation for my future and I want to be able to make my money work for me to eventually phase out working a 9-5 job and be able to enjoy the fruits of my labor before 67 as well as be able to set my future children up for success. How should I start? What would be a good timeline?

4. Professor Aggelos Kiayias recently dropped a video explaining exactly how Mithril (apparently neckbeard dungeon master talk for elf armor) is going to allow for Perfect Cardano (ADA) wallets that combine the ease of use and convenience of light wallets with the trustlessness of full node wallets. We also learned exactly how Mithril is going to work. [https://youtu.be/LhepJFCyWRk](https://youtu.be/LhepJFCyWRk)
5. In proof-of-work, bootstrapping can be done with blockheaders. This won’t do in proof-of-stake since we need information about stakeholder distribution to confirm block validity.
6. Mithril fixes this by being a cryptographic construction that enables a population of stakeholders to issue a signature consistent with certain constraints.
7. For Mithril to work in proof-of-stake, it needs three crucial properties: 1) it needs to enforce a threshold ratio of stakeholders before the signature is issued; 2) the pre-signature fragments must be independently verified and subject to public aggregation; and 3) it must be efficient in the sense that the final signature is of constant size and is logarithmically dependent on the # of stakeholders.
8. Stakeholders will issue special Mithril keys along with the normal cryptographic key material. Then at regular intervals, full nodes will test whether they can produce a pre-signature fragment. Only a random subset of stakeholders will be eligible to produce a pre-signature fragment. When a sufficient # of pre-signature fragments have been issued by eligible stakeholders then it will be possible to aggregate the fragments into a final signature.
9. This will be a checkpoint that will be verifiable with respect to previous check points all the way back to the genesis block. Such checkpoints will be cryptographic commitments of the relevant UTXOs.
10. Since the checkpoints will be trustless, a light client (i.e. wallet) will only need to verify the sequence of checkpoints up to the current time to trustlessly bootstrap.
11. The ecosystem is growing so fast, it’s hard to keep up with all the projects without these infographics at this point. [https://twitter.com/Dr\_shwetaPHD/status/1398783893638103040](https://twitter.com/Dr_shwetaPHD/status/1398783893638103040)

18. Vitalik is saying it’s highly unlikely we see ETH 2.0 before late 2022. I’m guessing that means mid 2023 which will be after two years of Cardano slaughtering the entire ETH user base. Things are looking so bad that Vitalik says he doesn’t even like using the ETH 2.0 label anymore since he knows the changes will be more incremental. This is what early capitulation sounds like guys.

37. Hedgefund Billionaire Paul Tudor Jones tells the world to buy crypto and certain other assets if the Fed doesn’t address inflation in their policy meeting that concludes on Wednesday. JP Morgan’s Jamie Dimon concurs that the current inflation is very likely not transitory.

41. While renewable energy is certainly a wonderful thing, there may be a problem with your technology when your path to compete on clean energy consumption involves you talking about harnessing the power of a whole series of volcanoes.

50. Bloomberg just published a piece called “America Should Become a Nation of Renters”. While this statement is probably extremely polarizing for Americans, it can also be argued that the death of homes as the primary investment vehicle of Americans may open up a new wave of adoption in crypto as an alternative.

54. It looks like the second biggest ETH stakepool or it's custody provider has lost it’s users private keys to $75MM in ETH. Cardano doesn’t have this problem. We get to keep custody of our crypto because we found a better way than slashing.

57. The June Cardano 360 is currently available on Youtube. [https://youtu.be/al5m14299ww](https://youtu.be/al5m14299ww)
58. We saw segments on various newer partner entities like Nervos, Orion Protocol, and Revuto. Nervos is a UTXO proof-of-work blockchain which is building a cross-chain bridge with Cardano so that you can use your ADA on Nervos dApps and vice versa. Interoperability is a big theme for Nervos and they plan to have a working testnet within a month. Orion Protocol is building a terminal that will allow for decentralized non-custodial trading across centralized and decentralized exchanges. They say this would not require you to KYC or even have an account with any of these exchanges. Revuto is an online subscription management service that recently completed a $10MM token sale on Cardano.
59. It was also revealed that Wolfram Labs, COTI, and IOHK have a three-way partnership (a ménage à tech) to build an NFT auction site. The people from Wolfram were talking about very interesting things including live minting during streaming events and automated upload to IPFS. COTI will be building out auction and bidding mechanisms in ADAPay.
60. Professor Aggelos Kiayias gave us an update on research including that Ouroboros Chronos and Hydra papers have both been accepted into conferences/journals. Chronos will provide Cardano with a global concept of time that doesn’t rely on any outside timekeeper. Prof. Kiayias also pointed out that Hydra is distinguishable from other layer two protocols in that the scripting language is identical to that of the base layer in Cardano such that any dApp that can run on Cardano will run on the Hydra L2. This is a huge plus and superior to many other layer two solutions in other ecosystems where the base layer dApps will not run on layer two. Finally, the Mithril paper has been submitted for peer review. It will provide Cardano light wallets with Succinct Non-interactive Arguments of Knowledge that will give us the best of both worlds: no delays for syncing as in full node wallets while still preserving trustlessness.
61. Finally, the Goguen Summit will be in late September. Sign up now at [summit.cardano.org](http://summit.cardano.org/).
62. The Fed is once again STRONGLY signalling to us that they are going to regulate stablecoins. The Fed is also specifically calling out Tether for the first time. You need to be thinking about how stablecoin regulation might affect your favorite Cardano DeFi or other project. [https://twitter.com/CaitlinLong\_/status/1408500265397985282](https://twitter.com/CaitlinLong_/status/1408500265397985282) [https://twitter.com/CaitlinLong\_/status/1408572624125534212](https://twitter.com/CaitlinLong_/status/1408572624125534212)
63. People are starting to realize that the Stakehound private key loss in ETH may attract unwanted regulatory attention to Ethereum 2.0 while this problem could never have occurred in Cardano. Also, only a few days later another ETH stakepool (this time SharedStake...the sixth biggest ETH Stakepool) allegedly experiences a rugpull that some are valuing at over $30MM. This is another problem that could not happen in Cardano staking. It feels like we stepped into the ring, they rang the bell, and ETH just started punching itself in the head. Eventually it’s going to KO itself.

vet,"Bright red bloody solid poops-kittens, first time owner","I adopted two kittens on July 4 after months of talking with their foster family.

The blood amount of small but bevause there’s blood, it’s still worrisome. 


The kittens did not have bloody poops at their foster family’s. 

Ive also squished apart the poops and there doesn’t seem to be any tapeworms in there. 

Both kittens are eating and drinking well, play and chase each other often, their gums are healthy, and are incredibly affectionate.  They are fed 1/4 can wet kitten food twice a day and are given dry food ( 2 spoonfuls at a time) 3x a day.  The meals are usually spaced out about 2 hours apart and the kittens are being trained with small dehydrated chicken treats that I rehydrate with water. 

I’ve arranged for vet appointments at two different hospitals and managed to get them on July 27 and Aug 3. I’m worried on whether or not the kittens can make it until those dates and every hospital I talk to are booked until august..  Am I overreacting about the bloody poops? Will the kittens be able to make it to their vet appointment?",cryptocurrency

CryptoCurrency,The story of the Rai Stones of Yap Island: How Cryptos will Die,"This story is about a wonderful little pacific island tribe, an innovative currency, and also some douchebag American who ruined everything for everyone. The reason this is a good story for people interested in cryptos is because it shows how a currency such as Bitcoin can come to an end in a not so surprising way. The Rai stones of Yap are likely the closest comparison to Bitcoin in world history.

For context, Yap island is a part of the modern day Federated States of Micronesia in Oceania. Yap Island did not have any limestone, but close by islands certainly did, and so it came that limestone would be mined to make Rai stones and Rai stones would become the currency of the Yapese.

Rai stones are not your typical currency, nor are they even your typical stones. Formed into large circular disks with a hole through the center, one could be forgiven for assuming these stones were nothing different from the currencies used at that time in other parts of the world. Here’s the thing, some Rai stones weighed up to four metric tons, requiring dozens of Yapese people to take part in sailing to another island, mining a large chunk of rock, and transporting the behemoth back to their tribe. As one can no doubt presume, this meant there was a scarcity of Rai stones and that the Rai stones held a high value.

So how were Rai stones used as a currency if they were so heavy? We all know that one of the most important  requirements for a good currency is salability, which may seem to be a murky thing if the item you are trying to trade is four metric tons. But the Yapese people developed this currency in a novel way. The Rai stones would be sat in the center of town and would not be moved once placed.

Rai stones would then be proclaimed as a specific persons property, and the whole town would then remember who it belonged to. If the owner of the Rai stone wanted to use the stone to make a trade, he/she would publicly proclaim to the town that stone was changing hands, and who it now belonged to. This meant Rai stones could have good salability across space, because the coin could be used to make a trade wherever you were in town. The scarcity of the limestone and labor to procure the Rai stones brought salability across time.

Salability across scale was achieved when the Yapese began trading fractions of their Rai Stones, allowing for small interactions to be had with the stones.

Then came the fateful day an American “discovered” their island. David O’Keefe, an Irish-American captain, wound up on the Yap shores after a storm, and he soon took note of the use of Rai stones. Once back on his feet, he took a boat to Guam, harvested Rai stones with TNT and other advanced technology, and came back to Yap thinking he’d be a millionaire. But the ease of which he acquired these Rai stones meant the same about of value was not intrinsically placed into the value of the coins.

This fact was not lost on the Yapese, and the Chief proclaimed captain O’Keefe’s stones as not worth a pebble. Nevertheless, it wasn’t long until these stones were accepted by some of the Yap people in hopes of tricking the rest of the people, and sure enough O’Keefe and his dynamite quickly devalued the Rai Stones beyond repair. It was no longer worth it to travel to another island and haul back a slab of limestone, and thus, the Rai Stone died.

I like this story because it tells us a few things:
1. The theory behind “Crypto currencies” are not new, it’s just the first time they are as secure and accessible as they are. 
2. Rai stones were not nearly as salable as cryptos and entire communities were able to use these as the only currency, so cryptos are certainly a viable option for mass adoption.
3. Cryptos will die when a new technology comes along so powerful that it mines massive market shares overnight (which will likely be impossible at that point anyway, so my point is really that cryptos will have salability across time.
4. When cryptos do inevitably die in a few millennia, it’ll probably be because of an Irish-American from Boston.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Pay ~3 student loans or invest the difference,"My girlfriend has recently graduated (May) and started her first year job making ~$30/hour full-time. She is planning on refinancing her 6.08% $42,000 private student loans and after shopping around, has already gotten quotes for 2.89% over 7 years and 2.99% over 10 years. 

My question being, should she take the 2.99% over 10 years to allow her to free up enough cash flow to save in a Roth IRA (or another account)? She has federal loans too amounting to about ~$20,000, but intends on applying for PSLF to forgive those after 10 years.

personalfinance,Just want to share some good news and maybe give others some helpful information.,"I had a Citi DoubleCash card with an $11,000 balance at 22.99% interest. My monthly payment was sitting at roughly $300 and for the first time since I’ve had the card, I was unable to make the minimum payment. 

I contacted Citi over the phone and explained my situation. I didn’t have the funds to pay the minimum, and probably wouldn’t have the funds for at least another two weeks.

Honestly, I was expecting them to tell me there was nothing they could do, and I’d be stuck with the penalty APR and late fees. However, to my surprise, they offered to lower the interest rate to 0% and drop my monthly payment to $190 which I would pay monthly over the course of five years until my balance is paid off. They also canceled my card, which I guess is a downside, but I had no business charging the card any further anyways, so I gladly accepted their offer. I asked them about any negative reporting to the credit bureaus, and they stated that as long as I paid every month, nothing negative would be reported.

Can’t even begin to explain how happy I am. For the longest time I saw no way out of this hole. Finally though there is some light at the end of the tunnel. If anyone is struggling with credit card debt, I’d suggest you just give your lender a call and let them know what’s going on. You might be surprised with what gets offered to you.

Edit: I’d also like to say that if you do decide to try down this avenue, definitely consider rejecting their first offer. The first offer they gave me was 5%/$250 month/5 years. I immediately rejected that and they came back with 0%.

CryptoCurrency,On inflation being a “good” and “healthy” thing when stable.,"Inflation at 2%-3%?Small potatoes,
Right?  Normal.  -HEALTHY- Part of a strong economy, right?

One of the greatest lies we are taught from a very young age is that steady inflation is a basic concept and that it is normal for there to be some in a growing economy.  It makes sense right? If the economy is growing, that must mean we have demand, which means people are continually going to spend more. You even see people in this sub, of all places, preach this.

From 1913 (when the federal reserve was created and fractional reserve banking across the world truly began) and 2013, the US dollar lost approximately 97% of its value from compound inflation.  Most people can picture this; You could buy a loaf of break in the 50s for a dime.

#But most people don’t know this: From 1813 -1913% the US dollar had practically 0% inflation.

That right, a silver dollar in 1813 bought the same amount of goods 100 years later. Yes there were periods of short lived inflation due to supply and demand, shortages etc. but the dollar, backed in gold and silver, held the same value in the long term.  It’s where the term “good as gold” comes from.

Keep in mind, the US experienced immeasurable growth during this period, including the industrial Revolution, King Cotton, the railroads, and automobiles.  And yet through all this, wages and prices remained fairly consistent.  Technology always becomes cheaper in time, true, but that is because when it’s new, everyone wants it, and there’s not enough to go around.  It also becomes less expensive to produce as new tech is discovered.

But regardless of the cheapening cost of tech; You can’t eat I phone and you can’t live in your Dolby 6k 5G 75 inch Smart TV.

By the way, silver in that dime that bought a loaf of bread in 1950?  It’s worth about $1.90 today.  Sooo… you can still buy a loaf of bread with it.  Two at a discount store.  What does a modern dime buy you?

TL:DR Inflation is vile, it is manufactured, and it’s a tool utilized by the rich elite to Rob wealth from the bottom and consolidate it to the top.  Never let it convince you otherwise.  Buy gold.   Buy silver.  Buy collectibles.  Buy stocks.  Buy land.  Buy real estate, and  Invest in the crypto that makes the most sense to you.  Remind me in ten years if you like .  This inflation slow motion train wreck is just getting started.  Gold 10k, Silver $600, and BTC 500k are almost a forgone conclusion.  Just wait.  And above all else?

CryptoCurrency,Bitfarms on The Bitcoin Standard podcast,"Disclaimer: I own BITF stock

Was surprised and excited to hear Saifedean talk with Ben Gagnon on his latest podcast. Link to podcast: [https://the-bitcoin-standard-podcast.castos.com/](https://the-bitcoin-standard-podcast.castos.com/)

The podcast covers a wide range of mining-related topics. Also provided new insights to me about investing in miners vs buying BTC (I do both). In short, investing in a mining company is investing in a continuous stream of BTC. Ben talks about a U-shaped curve where mining makes sense on a very small scale (with free energy like a dorm room) and a very large scale (BITF/Riot/Mara), but not at the medium scale. Investing in a mining company makes a lot more sense to me than trying to squeeze BTC out of a few ASICs.

When I heard about the China ban on mining, I doubled my stake in Bitfarms (spoiler alert, down 5%). The thinking was that non-China miners would experience a windfall with the hash rate drop (and difficulty drop). Sure enough, they just released guidance today that they are mining twice the BTC as usual, and they see this continuing for several months at least.

Stock in miners of BTC (and gold) act like calls/leverage on the underlying asset - without the downsides of margin calls or expiration. &lt;5% of my crypto portfolio is in miners, but I think it's an opportunity worth doing some due diligence on.

Even if you have zero interest in mining stock, give the podcast a listen. Ben is an impressive guy, and they discuss a lot of really interesting topics!",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Vanguard Roth IRA for my daughter help!,"Hello-  


My 14 year old got a job and wants to start throwing money in a Roth IRA.

I guess I'm confused as to what to do next after we've funded the account. The money, right now, is in the  VMFXX - Vanguard Federal Money Market Fund. Do I need to do anything else? My 401k contributions go into a targeted retirement fund and I literally do not do anything with it.   


It seems with the IRA, I need to pick the funds it's going to. Is VMFXX good for now? She's only allowed to work a certain number of hours per week, so she'll never hit the max contribution right now.

The article has 3 parts: (1) opportunities (2) my experience (3) risks (4) overall assesment.

Before starting you must take into account that I live in a country with strong capital flow restrictions in which people are not allow to buy more than 200 dolars in foreign currency for saving a month. With a 50%+ inflation rate this implies lots of problems. If you want to know more about them you can read yesterday's article! https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/ojfz13/stablecoins_from_the_perspective_of_a_3rd_world/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share

First let's define arbitrage: ""the simultaneous buying and selling of securities, currency, or commodities in different markets or in derivative forms in order to take advantage of differing prices for the same asset""

{1} Opportunities:
A. Arbitrage opportunities using interest rates:
This one is a sketchy and risky one. Interest rates are around 40% in my country, with an inflation rate of around 50% this would mean a real interest rate of around -6%. But here we will be looking at potential dollar gains, not gains in real terms (in such volatile economies this might be tricky). The exchange rate in Argentina is pretty much tied to the amount of dollars available as reserves. When we have lots of dollars we keep our exchange rate as low as possible because people are ""richer"" in terms of dollars. When reserves run out (we are out of dollars) we usually devaluate (meaning the dollar rises in price) and this usually leads to a inflation spirall. 
Anyways, for example, the exchange rate at febuary this year was around 165-170 pesos per dollar. As dollars poured into the economy due to a great harvest (and rising soy prices) the exchange rate dropped to 155 range about two months ago. With a ~3% inflation per month, and a ~2.5% interest rate on deposits this would mean a real rate of return of about 20-25% in dollars if you had sold your dollars for pesos, put them to get interest rate at a bank and bought dollars once again. An enormous return compared to other markets (I will talk about the risks further down the article if you want to skip).

B. Arbitrage opportunities using different exchange rates (in crypto) 
I just calculated the exchange rates of pesos per dolar by buying p2p cryptos.
USDT: 174.3
BUSD 176.4
BTC 177.15 (5.730.000/32.350)
Two things should be noticed. First, USDT is cheaper than BUSD, this is because USDT is used mainly for short term trade due to the risks it has by not being backed or audited. BUSD is used for short term saving and sheltering from a 0.1% daily inflation.
The other point is that the exchange rate is 1.6% higher when comparing BTC to USDT exchange rates, this is a guaranteed 1.6% return as long as you can find a buyer.

{2} My experience: I've tried doing arbitrage myself but there are small gains and potentially devastating loses. First the amount of transactions I would need to do in order to make a living from this would be huge given that I have small savings + 1.6% percent return is in pesos, which devaluate. Moreover it would raise red flags to the tax institution (which is like the IRS but on steroids) and that could get me tagged for life. So I made it a few times but mainly to get some extra income.

{3} Risks and problems: 
This are the main factors that you should take into account. 

A.There are abrupt and strong devaluations in which the exchange rate jumps 35% in a single day, wipping out the previous monthly gains, may even put you in red.

B.There is a strong hatred towards foreign investment in the country. So there are laws preventing it, for example the parking law: you cannot exit with your funds until they have been within the country for at least a year.

C.Tax preassure is absurdly high: 60% of the economy happens in the black market, the 40% in the oficial market must take the full burden of really expensive goverment policies. We are the country with the most taxes as there are over 179 taxes (imagine keeping track of that). You also have to pay you taxes (around 50%) in pesos gains, so with a 50% plus inflation even if you get a big return in pesos (say 30%) you would still lose money AND would still pay taxes. (Doble shot of goverment vaccination as my father calls it)

D.The market is really volatile. Compared to crypto it's pretty much the same in terms of daily volatility but there are days of 35%+ loses, not gains, so it's as risky AND with less rewards than crypto.

E.The market is small, like really small. As a poor country the black exchange rate market moves around 2-3 million dollars a day, so arbitrage opportunities are for small investors, if a big finance company came it would over saturate the market and all arbitrage would be lost. 

F.The goverment changes rules and does not respect private property. For example, a couple of weeks ago they approved a law for a new RETROACITVE tax. This means that money that you had already won, even post tax, has to pay taxes once again, even if you already spend it (yay more debt)

{4} Overall assesment: Even though it seems like there are great opportunities for arbitrage in such volatile economies such as mine, usually the risks outweight the potential gains. This is mainly because you cannot predict future goverment measures or restrictions, and many (such as a retroactive tax to crypto capital gains) affect decitions in the past! Moreover, most of our population has a hatred towards foreign funds and investment, this makes it more likely for a goverment to pass legislation that impacts negatively foreign investors as this measures are popular among the population (specially the poorest/most uneducated) in claims that this will give us ""national sovereignity"". Most do not understand that foreign investment is key for developing the infraestructure needed for a better economy. Finally, there is a HUGE tax preassure on investments as I mentioned before, so even if you get over-the-market-returns you still have to factor in taxes, which may even put you in the red.

Please keep the comment section civilizated! I'm planning to make a post a day doing research/explaining the economics behind coins for the next 2-3 weeks as I have holidays from studies. If anyone wants me to cover a specific topic let me know!! Most voted comment from the previous day will be researched!!

If you liked this article consider following me for more economics info!

Edit 1: Another experience in arbitrage: in 2019 after a far left-wing goverment (please don't get into politics) with a history of strong interventions (many companys fled because they usually did maximum price restrictions that had caused bankrupcy) won the preliminary elections. The exchange rate jumped around 35% in the following morning + bonds and stocks dropped another 20-30% of value. Anyways, in this context the goverment saw everything was going to hell and put a limit to buying USD of 10.000 dolars a month. As most of the population is poor this affected only around 0.1-0.2% of households. Of course a black market appeared and it sold dollars 10% above oficial exchange rate. So what you could do (and I did) was buy dollars at oficial exchange rate for example 100 dolars for 10.000 pesos, then sell those 100 dollars in the black market for 11.000 pesos (100* (100+10)) rinse and repeat. You could freely do it up to when you hit the limit of 10.000 dolars. So you would get a 10% return in a maximum of 10.000 dollars which meant 1.000 dollars (3-4 months salary for me). This was the most money I made doing arbitrage by far. There were even cases of people who took the identity of people from the slums and did this using their identity (using 20+ different identity cards). After 3 days this loophole was closed for good and we were only allowed to buy 200 dollars.",cryptocurrency
CryptoCurrency,Crypto has helped fill a hole left by recent surgery and I can't be thankful enough to this community.,"I have only quite recently started to look into Cryptocurrency after becoming more financially independent and spending a year or so in stocks and shares. I did quite well out of the whole pandemic by basically making some (accurate, but) risky assumptions about which companies had their share prices hit hard by lockdowns but would come back to similar levels of trading as soon as they finished.

Through this I turned a few thousand pounds into a house deposit for my first home. I was coming up on 30 with no prospects of home ownership and suddenly I'd 'beaten the system' I'd actually made massive gains in terms of percentage (roughly 300%) so was very proud of myself as a beginner.

Bolstered by this success at my first foray into investing, by hearing plenty about Cryptocurrency making people millionaires and by the terrible interest rates offered by my bank (0.01apy or something insulting like that?) I decided that my next venture would be with new coins.

I got in at what seemed like a good time, I'd missed all the recent ATHs, r/cryptocurrency was popping off with all these stories of how everything is going to be coming up Lambos... what a time to be alive! I made my investments and have tried not to look at them every 5 minutes since then.

Well, not long after this investment I had some medical issues that resulted in me needing surgery. I'll not going into the details of it but long story short I currently am in a month or so period where following the surgery I cannot have sex otherwise it will devastate what has been done by the surgeon. 

I'm sure most of you can imagine that this has been quite a difficult and frustrating time for both myself and my partner but the one thing that has really helped us both through it is this community. Without it I never would have taken the step and got my first exchange/wallet.

Everyday I get to log into Reddit to browse this sub and check my wallet and see the prices plummeting further and further and honestly... it's the closest thing to getting fucked I could have asked for at the moment.

Thanks Cryptocurrency!




TL/DR: Surgery left me unable to have sex for a month or so but it's ok because Crypto fucks me daily!",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,"I hope this question is welcomed here, honestly I'm pretty ashamed and embarassed for asking.","It's about my student loan payments with FedLoan. It's been a rough few years after graduation. I was able to make payments at first but a series of events happened where I couldn't make the payments anymore and had been struggling every since. With COVID and the student loan payment pause, I've been able to catch up on more immediate expenses but now that the pause is set to end in September I looked on the website to find this message:

Reaffirmation Agreement

I have lost eligibility for federal student aid due to ""overborrowing"".

What I took from it is that, they are basically giving me the option to pay my $33K in total loans in full or agree to continue making payments. 

Is that really what it means and what are my options? Also, what kind of game plan can I make to start paying this down if possible?",finance

personalfinance,Seeking Advice &amp; Education: Financing Home Improvement Project,"I'm posting to solicit advice and/or opinions for a home improvement project we're facing. Questions are at the end. Here are the pertinent details.

Project: New Siding and Windows - Siding is a must, but windows is ideal to complete the project at once.

Project Cost: We're still getting bids and tweaking some things. Let's say it's $90k for *everything* we want completed.

Cash: $60k - Budgeted Cash: $35k - $38k (this will likely pay for the siding entirely)

Additional Info:

* Both of us are stably employed. With school starting in the fall, we'll be saving an additional $400/month from child care. Still allocating $1,000/month for our youngest for the next 2.5 years.
* Mortgage: owe $172k at 3.5% (30yr fixed) purchased in 2012 (Missouri) - *no intentions of moving at all*
   * purchased at $240k and financed $220k
   * No idea on current value, but I'd have to imagine our equity is higher than original purchase price based on our current market trends
* Other Debt: $10k (ish) car payment (14 mos. to payoff)
* We *very much* prefer to accrue no further debt, but we're realizing this may not feasible based on needs (siding) and wants (windows - closer to needing though)
* We do have the opportunity to borrow some money to do kitchen windows first and then go room by room over the next several years. (less than ideal) However, we'd have to pay this money back, so in my mind, we wait and ""pay"" ourselves by saving and not owe anyone anything and do windows later. 
   * this option will be quite flexible given the source, but we'll intend to treat it like any other debt owed.

Options:

1. Pay cash for siding and wait on the windows. I'm told that siding prices have been relatively stable as compared to other building products (sheet goods, windows). Not that I'm trying to time the market, but if we wait to do windows, maybe the prices will have stabilized or dropped some?
   1. I do think we can wait and do the windows in 2.5 years and finance the remaining after child care costs go down, provided we do some additional sealing with new siding trim. We currently do not have water intrusion, but that's surprising given the state of some windows.
2. Cash out - refi: **This is where I'd like more information.** 
   1. What are the advantages and disadvantages to this option? 
   2. Would current interest rates, including the cash out option reduce, increase or have no major change to our current monthly mortgage ($1,300)? I realize this might be a bit hard to answer precisely.
   3. Advisable to go this route AND pay off the car payment immediately?
3. Other options I've not considered?",finance

personalfinance,"I have ZERO idea what my budget should be for a car, especially with this wild car market. I’m 28, $61k salary, $35k savings.","Hi r/personalfinance

I am NOT a car guy. My 2005 Honda Civic got totaled. I got a $3400 check from insurance for the car. I’m not sure what to budget for a car here or even what type of car I want. My plan was to keep driving the Civic 3-5 years and upgrade to a more permanent car then. The crash sped that timeline up and unfortunately, the car market is AWFUL, so I need help on setting a budget.

Some context on my finances/life situation:

* **Age:** 28
* **Salary:** $61k. 
* **Savings:** $35,000 in cash ($15k is my emergency fund) 
* **Debt:** $5k in federal student loans
* **Retirement:** $34k (started only 3 years ago, but put 28% of last year’s salary; Roth IRA and 403b); planning on getting a pension as a teacher eventually, but I'm doing more as backup in case I switch careers or something happens
* **Monthly take-home:** $2800 (can be increased by a bit by lessening retirement % a tad)
* **Expenses:** varies between $2000-2500 depending on month – remaining cash enters savings 
* **Credit:** pretty sure it’s good, never missed a payment on CC or loans for years, FICO reports 800+ on my CC webpage, but not sure how accurate that is; I’d say 750+ for sure though

For the car, I’m simple. I don’t need tons of features. I want a reliable, compact car to last me at least 10-15 years, be low-maintenance, and that takes me Point A to Point B comfortably. I live in the city and currently drive 8-10k miles/year. Civics, Corollas, etc…..those are my types!  After the accident, safety is a higher priority. I want to be financially smart by looking for *value*, while also acknowledging that I'm 28 with a career/savings and might want something a bit more modern/pleasant. For example, I know an 06-10 Corolla with 100k+ miles for $10-12k cash is a tank that might last 10 years and be the smartest financially, but I'm wondering if my situation is stable enough financially where I might be able to afford a more modern car with less miles and less risk. While I'm simple, I'd probably be hankering for an upgrade within 5 years and the used car buying process for cars over 100k miles is stressful. However, the current market is making me debate which option is best. These seem to be my options:

* **Option 1: Buying an older 2005-2010 model for $10k cash to last 5-10ish more years (or longer).**
*Positives* are cheaper up-front price, cheaper insurance, ideal for situation as urban dweller with street parking; good holdover for 5 years like my original plan. *Negatives* are safety in older models; inflated prices (2006-2010 Corollas and Civics going for $10k OTD with 120-150k miles; riskier purchase – even with reliable models and inspections, it’s still a 10-15 year old car and anything can happen with maintenance or buying a lemon

* **Option 2: Buy something in the middle ($15-20k OTD) with financing – likely $10k (or more) down payment.**
*Positives* are more modern 2014-2017 models, 50-80k mileage; likely reliable to last 10-15 years with good model and good care; fits my goal. *Negatives* are still overinflated pricing; 5-7 year Corollas can still be up to $19k OTD; carries some risk still

* **Option 3: Bite the bullet with a new/CPO car for the long-haul (can be $20k-28k OTD).**
*Positives* are warranty comfort; the care of the car is in my control; I’d have a car for 15 years at least; SOME CPO can be $20-22k, which seems within my price range. *Negatives* are that it's expensive, probably outside my salary range.

**So I wonder – what might be a good budget for me? Is $10k a solid down payment? And any thoughts on which option is most financially smart? I appreciate any comments, criticisms, or reassurances!**

Not required, but also down to hear about other reliable models that I don’t know about other than Civics/Corollas (probably better suited for r/whatcarshouldibuy, but just in case!)",finance

CryptoCurrency,"Bank of International Settlements makes it clear what the requirements are that they will enforce down stream for a CBDC. Who is down stream from BIS? Everyone, The European Central Bank, The Federal Reserve, The Bank Of England... Mexico, Italy....","&amp;#x200B;

# [Bank for International Settlements’ Head Agustin Carstens about CBDC and Control](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpNnTuK5JJU)

This clip is from Jan 2021 so it is not new news but as the world of CBDC heats up keep this in mind. These guys are very patient and comfortable in their position on top of the banking world.

# “For example in cash we don't know for example who is using a one hundred dollar bill today, we don't know who is a 1000 peso bill today. A key difference with the CBDC is that Central Banks will have absolute control on the rules and regulations that will determine the use of that expression of Central Bank liability and also we will have the technology to enforce that. Those are, those two issues are extremely important that makes a huge difference with respect to what cash is."" 

They ""dont know who is using a one hundred dollar bill""! Get it, like that is a problem of importance? The only reason that they want or need to know where every dollar is, is so that governments can threaten and control of ***you***. Never will they be able to stop criminals and they know it.   

These guys are going to give lip service to privacy but push anti money laundering rules as the reason for them being able to track every dollar, Pound, Euro, Peso.... What will be left out is that every time a system is created to trace criminals through the currency the crims just do a work around. EVERY TIME. And the average guy is left with more rules, more invasion of privacy and more big brother.

It is clear from this [paper](https://www.bis.org/speeches/sp180206.pdf) that BIS see's itself as the final authority on what money is, who should be allowed to issue it and what a CBDC should have built into it. 

How could this effect your favorite project? In everyway. BIS would just deny your project access to the Commercial Banking Markets and you will see the project slowly wither on the vine or attempt a work around that will be used to prove it was criminal from the beginning. As an early example of this is the banning of certain exchanges in certain countries. Binance's trouble in England recently. To stay in that market what Crypto or activity will Binance remove from its listings? I am sure these are just test balloons on ways to clamp down on these markets. There will be others but the exchanges are the easiest targets as they are centralized. 

CBDC are a year or two out for the major markets of the US and Europe but they are coming, in the mean time we are going to see regulatory measures put into place that will find some projects unable to perform under and will clear the way for the big banks to enter those markets unhindered by first to market innovators. Maybe a hard to get license will be needed or some documentation needed to be turned over to the IRS that violates the very purpose of the project. 

Its going to be unfair, not right, unjust  and every other thing. But these guys are not stupid (evil maybe, but not stupid) and will just rig the game so only they can win one more time. 

It may be possible to stop this if enough people really see it for what it is and dont just go whistling past the graveyard. There are people in congress who care in the US and many opinion leaders who speak out against this kind of dystopian control. Ron Paul is one. There are more than a few but not a lot. 

What we need is a true understanding of money, free markets and innovation. And how those things enhance freedom and in no way have **ever** hindered it. 

Of course as long as crypto and its news sources are dominated by moons and meme coins that can be made to look stupid and immature it will be a tough battle and the big group known as crypto enthusiasts will be given the moniker of crackpot kids or some other dismissive category.  

I for one would welcome a more decentralized market place. CBDC will be anything but decentralized. 

Your voice will be needed over the coming year or so, I will need you to speak out against this movement toward centralization. Will you do anything? I hope so. 

If not, we will all be talking about the good old days on r/beforeCBDC's very soon.",cryptocurrency

Inflation surges as consumer prices leap 5.4%, it’s the worst statistic in the US since 2008 (13 years). Milk, wine, gas, eggs, all cost more. The fact is that it’s true not only for the US as other countries struggle with inflation too.

We neither give you advice nor speak about prices or predict what’s going to be in the future. We just see that some reasons that caused inflation were: money printing, low-interest rates and COVID payments consequences.

personalfinance,Question About Late Tax Filing and HR Block Responsibility,"Hi All, I'll aim to keep this short.

Basically I did my taxes in HR Block for the 2nd or 3rd year in a row because my situation has been fairly complicated for a couple of years now (new to investing, spouse &amp; I living in different or multiple states for a couple of years, etc).

Did all of my tax work in their system in April and submitted in the middle of the month. After the expert review and a few adjustments, we were set to get a refund in one state, pay another state, and pay to federal.

When everything was done, I input all of my banking information so everything could be submitted and completed electronically - and I scheduled the payments to be made like two weeks later so I'd have time to move money around and ensure everything needed was in my account.

So those two weeks go by and lo and behold, I got a direct deposit for the one state refund, and saw a debit for the other state payment. Yet, nothing on Federal - which was around a $7,700 payment or so.

Another week or so goes by and I start to worry. I messaged my tax pro that worked on my returns on May 10 with this message:

&gt;Hi , I was wondering if there was any way to review/confirm when my tax payments will be taken from my account. If I remember correctly, during the filing process I input our account info and selected a date near the deadline (sometime this week) to make the payments. However, I'm not sure I have access to any info or confirmation via HRBlock that tells me what day that is supposed to happen. I funded my account for the payments but just want to know when I should expect to see that come out. Do you have that info or can you point me to somewhere in the platform where I can see that?

No response, so I again messaged this tax pro on June 1 with this message:

&gt;Hi , following up on this message. I still haven't seen the federal payment come out of my account and I'm concerned about paying a penalty or late fee. I know we set up payment info for federal the same way (account, date, etc.) as state, which already came out. Are you able to see anything on your end indicating that it's set up correctly? Hoping it's just a delay on the IRS side and nothing on our end.

&amp;#x200B;

Around this same time I posted on Reddit and believing what I wanted from one of the responses, the IRS was backlogged and things were taking longer than usual - made sense.

However I was still worried and tried to contact HR Block by phone, and I got a pretty unhelpful rep and we seemingly couldn't hear each other well. The call ended in failure to resolve anything after about 20 minutes, and I kind of went back to checking my account daily to see if that Federal payment came out.

Well last week I got a letter from the IRS saying we owe that original amount, plus interest and a penalty. Those only amount to $150 so not a huge deal on a nearly $8k tax bill, but I'm more than irritated, and have this one simple question: **what should I do from here?**

My assumption is to pay it all and then go after HR Block for reimbursement on the penalty and interest, because as far as I know, everything with the banking info was set up properly and scheduled appropriately, given the two states had no issues giving/taking money as scheduled. I'm more than irritated at the lack of response from the tax pro, and the impossible customer service on their website.

Could I have gone after this more aggressively? Sure, probably. But I do feel I did what I needed to do and then HR Block essentially went dark on me.

Any advice that I can consider? Payment is due by 7/26 so I have a little time, but I just want this resolved and don't want to pay the $150 in interest and penalties if I don't have to.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: I should note that it looks like part of the penalty is for not paying enough during the year - which is fair - but the other penalty and the interest is for failure to pay the balance due by the deadline.",finance

I am thinking about this for a long time, but maybe we can exchange some ideas and thoughts on this subject. What does the development and adoption of CBDC mean for cryptocurrency? Will it close the gap between “regular money” a.k.a. fiat and cryptocurrency? Will CBDC give central banks even more power? Would you prefer CBDC over regular fiat, or cash? How does adoption of CBDC have effect on worldwide economy? What are privacy concerns of CBDC?

vet,Puppy can only tolerate adult dog food,"So I got a puppy (Golden Retriever) about 10 weeks ago and when I picked him up he was being fed Adult Dog Food (Retriever Hi Protein) so I tried switching him to multiple different puppy foods (all different protein sources; chicken, beef, salmon, lamb) and unfortunately none of them worked out since it gave my pup loose stools/diarrhea. 

I did the whole bland diet (boiled chicken and rice) between each transition while slowing adding the new puppy food and as soon as we reached 1/2c of the new puppy food, loose stools resumed. So being worried that I’m depriving my growing pup of vital nutrients by keeping him on this bland diet cycle I decided to try to go back to the adult dog food he was on when I picked him up and now the loose stools are gone. In fact, they are pretty spectacular stools to the point where I can’t believe I’m impressed by poop at this point lol. 

My question is whether or not this is the right move.. I know adult dog foods aren’t totally complete for nutrients for a puppy but the alternative was keeping him on the bland diet which has been going on for 8-9 weeks straight which concerned me since it is so lacking in nutrients to. I don’t know what it is more detrimental to a growing a pup; an extended period of time on a bland diet or being on adult dog food which still has at least some amount of their nutritional needs the bland diet doesn’t provide. Is there something I should supplement if I choose to stay on this route? Should I be worried about anything?

CryptoCurrency,The FED and J Powell,"I was watching JPOW talk and obviously the crypto regulation topic caught my attention. 

While at first I was worried, thinking any type of further regulation would hurt crypto, I actually think it would be a good thing. 

Regulating crypto will make it seem more legitimate amongst the general public and more people will jump on the crypto train. 

More importantly, hopefully some of the regulations are also aimed at big money and people like Elon. If regulation can somehow decrease the volatility, not only will it be better for the prices of each coin but it will bring in even more investors.

personalfinance,Am I doing enough with what I've got?,"Hi all, TIA for any advice you can give me. I am mainly concerned with an aggressive plan to pay down debt/if I am making smart decisions for my retirement and future. Throwaway to protect sensitive info.

&amp;#x200B;

Income:

I am 26yo, graduated from university 4 years ago and have the same full time position that I got 1 year after graduation. I earn \~55K and have a full benefits package that is paid for by my employer. My contribution is like 140/month. I also have a side job that in busy times nets me \~460 per week.

Savings:

I have \~12K in my 401K and am set for 9% contribution. unfortunately my employer doesn't match so all that is coming from me. I also have \~10K in a hys, \~900 in an acorns account, and \~1300 in stocks just for me to figure things out. i also have a tiny fraction of a bitcoin.

Debt:

71K in student loans is the killer. They are all federal though, and I have been able to save what is in the HYS from them being on covid pause. They are split up into 4 big groups: 21k (6.5% thanks mom), 21k(5%), 11k(4%), 18k(4%). I have always paid a little over minimum and this past year have been making payments to get rid of about 10K in principal.

Bills:

my portion of rent is \~875 (i split with my bf) and gas, electric, wifi, phone, hulu, netflix, spotify, etc ends up being around $200 for each of us. I live in a HCOL area and I have no intention of leaving unless we decide to buy a house (which won't happen until I kill my student loans). Car ins is \~475 every 6 months.

&amp;#x200B;

Am I balancing everything enough? Is 9% into retirement too aggressive? Not aggressive enough? Should I be more aggressive on my student loans? Should I keep the 10K in the HYS as a safety net or dump it into my SL in October when payments resume? How long do you think it will take me to pay down these loans?",finance
personalfinance,When is the best time to ask for a raise?,"Hi all,

I’m debating when I should ask for a more significant raise at my current job, and was hoping y’all could help. 

My boss just took another job, and management made no immediate plans to replace her, which means we’re naturally doing more work to cover the slack. We’re also down about 1.5 team members on top of that, with only vague references as to when the positions will be filled. We’re due to have annual reviews and raises in September, which are usually around 3-4%. Because of the extra workload from being understaffed, I’d like to ask for a larger than normal raise at my review. However, I’m also going for a certification that is supposed to give me a ~10% raise as well(I believe it’s negotiable), but I won’t be able to take that test until after the annual raise in September. 

So basically, I can’t decide if I ask for a larger raise in time with the annual review, focusing more on the understaffed/more responsibility factor(and also mention to them that I’m getting certified soon) or take the 3-4% raise, wait until I get certified a few months later, and risk those positions being filled and not being able to rely as heavily on that aspect of the ask, but still negotiating based on the extra work I do for the job anyway. If I do nothing, theoretically by the end of the year I should have about a 14% increase which is nice, but in general I’m underpaid at this job, so I was hoping to use either the understaffing or certification, or mixture of both to get a little more on the correct level.  

Anyway, hope this makes sense, happy to clarify anything I need to.",finance
personalfinance,Need advice on current car,"Hi there, I am currently a 23 year old college student and I've been paying on a 2018 Ford Focus Titanium sedan for about 2 years now. My credit was decent at the time but I had limited history so I ended up with a terrible interest rate (19.2%). I was wondering if I should try to get out now that the market is up for used vehicles.

I bought the car originally for 15.8k and have it paid down to around 12k but I feel like I've been in over my head the entire time and haven't been able to actually save anything. It currently has 50k miles and is in excellent condition so I think I'd get a decent private party offer, compared to what they are selling for in my area.

My only problem would be getting another vehicle but since I have credit history and a decent score behind me that shouldn't be such an issue, right?

On the rise of stablecoins (stable cryptocurrencies), Powell stated that ""There is clearly a demand \[for currencies\] and we have been very focused on providing better regulatory responses to potential global stablecoins.""

Now get back here.

Have you ever stopped to imagine this: most countries in the world have their international reserves in dollars - Brazil, for example, has $356 billions - news in March 2021). Thus, it is not possible to deny that this is a fiat currency that move the world and business as a whole.

A series of concerns thinking here:

1- How is it that the ""health"" of cryptocurrencies can be maintained in the long term with the main ""threat"" being the ""centralization"" of central banks and their fiat currencies? Or the Opposite: How can central banks enter the decentralized world of cryptos in a way that does not undo all the power and underwritten capacity of their fiat currencies? It's a knot in the brain 😆.

2 - Here comes other things in my mind: bitcoins, for example, are finite... which would prevent a person from just concentrating all this power for themselves in a physical wallet (imagine the hardware with all the Bitcoins already created in the world 🤣. This is a Rich guy!!!), or within digital central banks in your countries?

I go even further: would it be possible to still have a universal crypto currency of free circulation that has the same power as the dollar has today?",cryptocurrency

stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Wednesday, July 14, 2021","**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, July 14, 2021**

Stocks largely gained today in another volatile session, with the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Nasdaq (QQQ) once again powering to new intraday highs, the third time this week for the SPY. The major indexes continue to be driven higher by continued strength in mega-cap tech stocks. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small caps, continued its streak of underperformance, trading 1.65% lower today at the time of writing. Market participants continue to digest new inflationary data, Q2 earnings season, and Jerome Powell’s testimony before Congress.

This week, the market is starting to experience signs of volatility, with the SPY opening the session firmly in the green before falling until about the middle of the session before recovering to close the day green. It seems to me that recent reports about inflationary data have injected some uncertainty into the market. The Labor Department’s June Consumer Price Index (CPI), which measures changes in the prices of consumer goods, rose 0.9% in June, accelerating from May’s 0.6%. Year-on-year, the CPI is up 5.4%, exceeding the 4.9% expected by economists and the fastest rate of growth since 2008. Core CPI, which excludes the volatile price energy and food and is therefore considered a more accurate representation of general price inflation, was up 4.5% year-on-year as prices bounced from last year’s pandemic-era lows.

Today, a report by the Labor Department showed that the Producer Price Index (PPI), which measures the average changes in prices received by domestic producers for their output rose 1% in June, accelerating to 7.3% rise year-on-year, while still reflecting base effects. Core PPI rse 5.5%. This is the fastest rate of increase since 2009.

While the CPI and PPI prints are not ideal, the market’s somewhat muted reaction (though there was a little volatility) seems to confirm that market participants are increasingly pricing in higher-than-expected inflationary data and are buying into the Federal Reserve’s argument that current pressures are transitory and due to pandemic-related disruptions. Moreover, it is very important to consider that current inflationary data is calculated on a year-on-year basis, so base effects are very much inflating the current numbers. In other words, inflationary readings are high because they are being measured using numbers from June 2020 when prices across the board collapsed as lockdowns and social distancing policies were implemented across the world. As I have said many times in the past, I am personally not yet worried about current inflationary pressures translating into a prolonged cycle of higher prices, though one always has to acknowledge the risks in the market and be prepared to act.

In other news, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell gave  his semi-annual monetary policy to Congress, where once again, he basically said the same thing he has been saying for months. Powell said “inflation will likely remain elevated in the coming months before moderating” and that the US economy was “still a ways” off from reaching the threshold of “substantial further progress” that would trigger the Central Bank to roll-back pandemic-era policies. In short, Powell basically said while he expects higher inflation prints in the coming months, pressures are transitory and due to pandemic era disruptions and the Fed’s goal for economic recovery have not been met. [Here is Powell’s complete testimony, but here are two of his most important quotes.](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/testimony/powell20210714a.htm)

**On the labor market:** “Conditions in the labor market have continued to improve, but there is still a long way to go. Labor demand appears to be very strong; job openings are at a record high, hiring is robust, and many workers are leaving their current jobs to search for better ones. Indeed, employers added 1.7 million workers from April through June. However, the unemployment rate remained elevated in June at 5.9 percent, and this figure understates the shortfall in employment, particularly as participation in the labor market has not moved up from the low rates that have prevailed for most of the past year. Job gains should be strong in coming months as public health conditions continue to improve and as some of the other pandemic-related factors currently weighing them down diminish.”

**On inflation:** “Inflation has increased notably and will likely remain elevated in coming months before moderating. Inflation is being temporarily boosted by base effects, as the sharp pandemic-related price declines from last spring drop out of the 12-month calculation. In addition, strong demand in sectors where production bottlenecks or other supply constraints have limited production has led to especially rapid price increases for some goods and services, which should partially reverse as the effects of the bottlenecks unwind. Prices for services that were hard hit by the pandemic have also jumped in recent months as demand for these services has surged with the reopening of the economy”.

**Highlights**

* Big banks continued to underperform today, with investors not impressed despite banks posting very strong earning reports. . JP Morgan, which is often considered a bellwether for the US economy given its sheer size, reported great results, driven in part by the release of $3 billion the bank had set aside to protect against potential losses from default loans during the pandemic, a sign that consumers held up better than the bank expected. JPM recorded revenues of $31.4 billion and profits of $11.948 billion, a staggering improvement from profits of $4.687 billion a year ago. One downside from the earnings report is a sharp reduction in revenues produced from trading, which is not surprising given the insane run by the market in 2020.
* Airline stocks initially gapped up in the morning after American Airlines (AAL) and Delta Airlines (DAL) offered upbeat outlooks for the second half of 2021, citing increasing consumer demand as the US continues to reopen. However, stocks were unable to hold onto their gains and largely finished negative.
* Twitter (TWTR) announced it was discontinuing its disappearing Fleets feature after failure to win traction with users.
* According to Facebook (FB), the company is pledging $1 billion to support content creators on its platforms through the end of 2022. Content creators will receive a monthly bonus if they hit milestones for earnings Stars, a form of digital tipping that fans can use to pay their favorite creators during live-streamed videos. Instagram's bonus programs will include incentives to use Reels, its copycat TikTok feature that showcases short-form video clips. Creators will earn money based on how their Reels videos perform, the company said.
* Microsoft (MSFT) is betting hybrid work will provide an opening to make its Windows operating system more widespread, launching a new service aimed at getting users of Apple (AAPL) and Android products to use the software. Windows 365, the company said, will be accessible on any device running any operating system that has a web browser, such as Apple Mac computers, iPhones and iPads, or those running Android software made by Alphabet (GOOGL)

personalfinance,"Newly married couple looking to distribute savings into retirement, house down payment, and student loans","Hi everyone! My wife and I are in our late 20s, recently married and we have some cash savings. We live pretty frugally (albeit in an expensive area), currently rent a 2BR apartment, and would like to purchase a starter home (likely a townhouse or condominium), which is around $400,000 in my area. We have been saving at least $1,200 per month in the past year in order to put toward my wife’s student loans, but because payments and interest have been deferred until October 2021, we have just been taking the extra money and putting it into a savings account.

Reason for wanting to move: we currently share a car. My wife drives the car to work (18 mile round trip), and I ride a bicycle (36 mile round trip). The area we are looking in is a little closer to my work (~20 mile round trip) and has very good, direct public transportation access to my job if needed. Her commute would remain manageable and I would have more options for my commute. Also, the area is rapidly growing, with a good education system and close proximity to the city. I do realize that the housing market is a hot mess right now, so I’m open to hearing whatever suggestions you may have.

**Finance snapshot (combined):**

* Annual gross income: $95,000
* Net worth: $90,000 ($47,000 in Roth IRA/retirement accounts, $61,000 cash on hand, and $18,000 student loan debt)
* Credit score 770-800

* Take home pay: $6,000 per month
* Expenses (excluding retirement contributions): $2,800 per month ($1,800 of this is rent)

**Debt:**

* Student loan debt: $18,000. About $9,000 of this is at an interest rate of 4.5% and about $9,000 of it is at an interest rate of 3.7%. Monthly minimum payment is $300/mo.

**Retirement contributions for 2021:**

* Husband: $2,500/$6,000 contributed
* Wife: $0/$6,000 contributed

**The question(s):**

We are very risk-averse. What makes the most financial sense in the long term is definitely to contribute $9,500 toward both of our retirement accounts. Being free of debt and paying off the student loans would also be psychologically freeing and we would still have enough money in our emergency fund (around $15,000 for six months of living expenses). But… we really want to purchase a home and I feel like what makes sense for us personally is to contribute some to our retirement accounts, pay off the highest interest student loan debt, and have some money to put toward a 3-5% down payment on a home. In the worst case scenario, we have until April 2022 to put toward 2021 Roth IRA contributions.

CryptoCurrency,Some thought on the Shiba Inu Craze,"I get very concerned when people talk about how “if coin X reaches price Y then I’ll be rich” and call that investing. Let’s call what it really is folks: gambling.

That being said if anyone were to do their due diligence on Shiba it would look something like this:

1. Monetary policy: burn 50% of the total supply (1 quadrillion) to Vitalik Buterin which has been done already. Now why 1 quadrillion? Many other tokens like Bitcoin, Ethereum, even Cardano start with a small supply to promote scarcity which in turn drives up market valuation provided there is adoption of their token. This is an important consideration. The only way Shiba could “moon” (as some say in the Shiba Reddit forums) is if they intend to burn more tokens. To facilitate this some community members have pledged to burn portions of their Shiba holdings. Will it work? It could if enough people do it but no way of knowing for sure

2. Offerings: ShibaSwap is their biggest selling point. They intend to create an exchange where artists and others can trade Shiba Inu inspired tokens like “BONE” and “LEASH.” Can’t find much more info on this currently. Should that worry me? Another important question. In my view transparency is paramount

3. Community: a strong project has an army of dedicated community members who truly believe in the value of the project and consistently seek to add value. So far after scouring the Reddit forums I only see people interested in pumping up the price. There may very be people who care about the project on other forums but I haven’t looked at those yet. 

Overall my biggest question mark is what they said on their website under the header “Ecosystem”. They said “SHIB is an experiment in decentralized community building.” What does this mean anyway?

Also, I like the idea of having an artist incubator. But for Shiba Inu artists? Is there even a market for that? These are important questions to ask. 

Personally, their monetary policy puts me off. It could go up again or it could stay down like it is currently. But if you’re reason for buying into a token is because it will go up then just call it gambling.

How’s my analysis? Am I missing something here?

P.S. my dad bought 100 million Shiba tokens and is now digging on Shibaswap lol. Thoughts on this?

Edit: this wasn’t meant to be a fully fledged analysis. I am currently doing some analysis and reading the entire paper and will post my analysis later. This post was just to shed my thoughts and spark some discussion. But that’s fact remains that I’m still highly skeptical. Happy discussing :)",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Refinance Student Loans to a HIGHER interest rate?,"Hey all,

I currently have \~$76k in student loan debt, and I am going to start full-time employment next month. I originally took out the private loans with variable interest rate, which has since fallen to a current rate of 1.15%.

My current loan term is a 5 year payoff. I am currently in the ""pay interest-only"" grace period, which ends in November. So starting end of November, I'd be making \~$1.4k payments for the next 58 months, at which point the loan would be paid off.

&amp;#x200B;

I have two questions, both of which are related to refinancing:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Given how low refinance rates are right now, should I refinance my loans to a slightly higher fixed rate (probably around 2.0-2.5%) to protect myself from the variable rate eventually ballooning again? Do you think that'd happen soon?
2. I'm planning to max my 401k to the employer match amount, max my Roth, and then max my 401k to the limit in that order. After that, given that I can refinance my current 5-year loans to relatively low-rate, longer-term loans (variable rate \~1-2% or fixed rate \~2.0-2.5%), should I refinance to a longer-term loan and just pay the minimum each month?
   1. The rationale here is that with the \~$1k or so in savings from the lower loan payment each month, I could turn around and invest that amount and presumably make more on my investments than the loan interest rate would cost me. Am I being over-idealistic and dumb to consider that?

Please feel free to tell me I'm an idiot in regards to any part of this post, but I would really appreciate your help and advice!",finance

Well in March, the American Rescue Plan was signed and made available subsidies for higher income earners like myself. So I signed up through healthcare.gov.

Initially I thought that they used the firm definition of MAGI to calculate APTC meaning traditional IRA contributions would be added back to AGI to make MAGI. After reading a bit more, the fed will use their own definition of MAGI and allow a calculation that deducts trad IRA contributions.

Tomorrow I will be recharacterizing my Roth contributions with my broker to convert to traditional, which will lower my income in the eyes of the healthcare subsidy people by a whopping 12k. This will be huge and save me thousands because I will qualify for a much higher APTC.

So PSA: double check your income, make sure you can deduct traditional contributions, and recharacterize if you typically Roth like me.",finance
vet,MY DOG ATE A RAZOR BLADE IM TAKING ALL SUGGESTIONS last resort .. PLEASE HELP,"My dog, 21lbs 10 month old male maltipoo, ate two razor blades about a week ago. Now I’m not completely sure if he did ingest them but I found a chewed up razor w bits of plastic… he could’ve dropped the razors somewhere else. (I found bits of the plastic in my shoe).
By the time I noticed he was acting a bit weird I wasn’t sure if it was the heat, lack of activity, or if he had picked up on my mood (I haven’t been feeling great).
He could’ve pooped it out between the time frame I haven’t yet realized what happened (approx 24-48hrs) so I didn’t get the chance to look for it in his poop. Or like I said could’ve dropped it somewhere else and not have ingested it at all.
I’ve been trying to get him seen by a vet but emergency hospitals are CRAZY expensive about 5x more than reg hospitals and since my step sisters kicked me out, my mom left for MX and doesn’t send support and my grandparents (who I’m living with) don’t let me get a job.. this is a really tough spot I never thought I’d be in.
I made an appointment for this Friday (soonest I can get) but by then it would mark the 2 week time period of possible ingestion.
Symptoms: 
-He’a lost his appetite for kibble, he’ll eat some if drowned in broth and mixed with chicken but won’t even finish that BUT will eat treats and such. I read this can be possible anorexia due to an upset stomach which in this case would be caused by the razor. 
-Stools are amazing, better than usual because of the broth. Brown to dark brown he’s passing everything. He snatched some aluminum foil from me and he passed it all with no problem. Even bits of the plastic from the razor head. No straining
-yesterday (1w later after suspected ingestion date ) he vomit a fistful of grass with chunks of the razors plastic tangled in. Apparently my grandpa fed him grass (he didn’t know you’re not supposed to induce vomiting when you suspect they ate a sharp object) but it happened, and he vomit. No blood just fluids, grass and plastic.
-He was acting odd a few days ago but like I said could’ve been picking up on my mood. Since then he’s been happy and energetic. 
-no signs of pain
-he’s been dehydrated for a while, dark yellow urine. I cant
Get him to drink enough water and since the incident I’ve been limiting his activity to avoid the razor moving around too much.
This was 100% my fault I can’t believe i failed him like this but  can’t let my feeling get in the way of way must be done..I’ve been trying to Supress it until I can see he’s happy and healthy but until the sonnet all I can do is sit around and wait for his next poop and god forbid pain symptoms… if anyone has any ideas I’m open to anything if your read this far thank you so much all I’ve been getting from vets is referred from one hospital to the next

UPDATE: he’s been completely fine up to the date of his appointment (today, 12am) but I was watching his every move for symptoms. they’ve had him all day I just got a call and they said he’s completely unfazed and they managed to the get pieces out. We got SO lucky I can’t believe this ever happened on my watch …. Never in my life have I had this kind of issue with my dogs and never will I again.

personalfinance,Should I refinance all of my student loans to a manageable rate and save more for retirement?,"I have about $65,000 of total student loan debt, with $35k being one private loan at 3.8% and the remaining $30k spread out among 10 different federal loans (average interest rate before forbearance was around 5%)

I know that the COVID forbearance on federal loans may be extended in September, but it also may not. In the meantime I have been hurling all of my payments (about $1200/mo) towards the private debt. However, I really want to make better habits in saving, especially automatically from my paychecks. I contribute 6% to my 401(k) and my employer matches 4.5% - and I would like to move my 401(k) from a previous job worth about 20k into an IRA and start contributing to that as well. However in order to save more, I wouldn’t be able to pay my debt down as aggressively as I do.

Just this week I went back to credible and can refinance all of my $65k to a rate of 2.8% over 10 years. This would make my minimum payment about $630/mo which would be about $150/less than what I would be paying if the COVID forbearance is lifted.

I have an emergency fund of about 15k and think I have job security where I will likely never need to take advantage of any of the repayment plans offered by the government. My thought is that I can take some of the left over cash flow from my student loan payment being lowered and likely getting a rate of return greater than 2.8% from long term investing.

Is this a sound strategy? Or should i potentially wait and see what could happen with federal student loans?",finance

Long story short, last year I ended up leaving my apartment and my landlord charged me for repairs to a part of the property. I signed off on it and reached an agreement that we would pay that money back in monthly installments, with a “per annum” interest rate.

personalfinance,"Used car financial strategy: One way to smartly budget, buy, finance, then upgrade your next (or first) vehicle","This is a strategy that was first explained to me, as a teenager, by one of my dad's older engineering colleagues.  I've shared this method with several friends to great effect over the years, so I figured I'd post it here for your benefit as well!

This is one method to purchase a reasonable and affordable used car, then periodically upgrade to a newer vehicle over time.

Step 1: Determine an affordable payment given your cash flow situation (there are a million posts on this topic. I won't go into depth, but the ""&lt; 10% of take-home"" rule of thumb tends to make sense!) Let's say $250/mo is an affordable payment for this scenario.

Step 2: Use a loan calculator to determine a total loan amount based on the payment established above. Make sure the loan term is no more than 36 months. You can also use the PV function in excel! Let's assume we get a 3% annual interest rate (remember to divide that by 12 in excel!). This gets to a loan amount of $8,596.62.

Step 3: Determine your total purchase price by multiplying the loan amount above by 2. Basically, we're going to put 50% down on a $17,193.24 (or thereabout) vehicle and finance the other half.

Step 4: Find a 3-year old vehicle with reasonable mileage (&lt;36k ideally) for $17k. If you don't have $8,600 to put down, the take the amount you do have, and multiply that by 2 to arrive at your purchase price. I'm seeing a 2018 Toyota Corolla (writing this in 2021) on Autotrader.com for $16,988. After some negotiation, and sales tax, I'd bet you can keep the final price under $17k.

Step 5: Plan to own the vehicle for 6 years. In the first 3 years, you'll simply pay your minimum loan payment. in years 4-6, you'll continue making that same payment, but into your own savings account. In this scenario, at the end of six years, you'll have saved up $9,000 ($250 X 36 months)

Step 6: Sell the car after 6 years. Caredge.com suggests that a 3-year old Toyota Corolla that was bought for $17k might have a resale value of roughly $11k after 6 years.

Step 7: You should now have roughly $20k available to put toward your next vehicle ($9k saved, plus $11k resale proceeds). One option is to buy another 3-year-old car for cash. Another option is to upgrade your ride. Simply re-calculate your new affordable payment per Step 1. Assuming your income has kept up with a 2.5% inflation rate, you should be able to comfortably afford a $290 payment by then, meaning a $9,972 loan amount, and a vehicle costing between $19,944 ($9,972 X 2) and $29,972 ($9,972 + $20,000). Another search of autotrader.com says I could potentially upgrade to a 3-year-old Lexus IS 300 for under $30k. Repeat the 6-year payment and saving process to come away again with ~$26k for your next purchase in year 12.

Questions: 
Why a 3 year old car? For one, the depreciation curve has generally begun to level off after 3 years. Additionally, there tends to be a strong supply of vehicles coming off of a 36-month lease, and these vehicles seem to be well cared for in my experience.

Why own for 6 years? If you're like the average driver, you'll tend to put about 12k miles on the vehicle per year. If you purchase at 36k miles, this would put the vehicle at 108k miles when you sell it. Again, in my experience, this seems to be the time when major work is required (timing belt) and the interior niceties tend to wear out (plastic knobs, dash lights, etc.). It also seems like there are still a healthy number of buyers in this 9-10 year age range, especially for particular makes/models. Finally, when you do purchase your next vehicle, a six year difference in model years will feel like a really great upgrade.

While I generally caution people away from getting into debt, if you're like me, you probably need a car before you've saved all of the money up front. I thought this strategy was pretty genius when it was originally explained to me. What do you think? Have you heard this strategy before? Are there ways to improve upon it? Any other ideas?",finance

CryptoCurrency,What is Yield farming?,"***TLDR at the bottom***

**What is yield farming in DeFi and how does it work?**

**What is yield farming?**

At its core, yield farming is a process that allows cryptocurrency holders to earn rewards on their holdings. With yield farming, an investor deposits units of a cryptocurrency into a lending protocol to earn interest from trading fees. Some users are also rewarded with additional yields from the protocol’s governance token. 

Yield farming works in a similar way to bank loans. When the bank loans you money, you pay back the loan with interest. Yield farming does the same, but this time, the banks are crypto holders like yourself. Yield farming uses “idle cryptos” that would have otherwise been wasting away in an exchange or hot wallet to provide liquidity in DeFi protocols like Uniswap in exchange for returns.

**Understanding liquidity pools, liquidity providers and automated market maker model**

Yield farming works with a liquidity provider and a liquidity pool (a smart contract filled with cash) that powers a DeFi market. A liquidity provider is an investor who deposits funds into a smart contract. The liquidity pool is a smart contract filled with cash. Yield farming functions based on the automated market maker (AMM) model. 

This model is popular on decentralized exchanges. AMM eliminates the conventional order book, which contains all “buy” and “sell” orders on a cryptocurrency exchange. Instead of stating the price that an asset is set to trade at, an AMM creates liquidity pools using smart contracts. These pools execute trades based on predetermined algorithms.

The AMM model relies heavily on liquidity providers (LPs), who deposit funds into liquidity pools. These pools are the bedrock of most DeFi marketplaces where users borrow, lend and swap tokens. DeFi users pay trading fees to the marketplace; the marketplace shares the fees with LPs based on their share of the pool’s liquidity. 

Take Compound, for instance. The protocol provides liquidity to borrowers who want to borrow funds in cryptocurrencies. The Compound Finance system does this using smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. LPs deposit funds into the liquidity pools. These contracts serve as the matching engine for market participants. 

Once an interest rate for the loan has been agreed upon, the borrower gets the funds.

In exchange for their funds, LPs get Compound Finance’s native COMP tokens. They also get a cut of the interest that the borrowers pay.

Some of the most common DeFi-related stablecoins include USDT, DAI, USDC and BUSD. Some protocols can also mint tokens, which represent your deposited coins in the system. For instance, if you deposit ETH into Compound Finance, you get cETH. If you deposit DAI, you get cDAI.

**Yield farming returns**

Estimated yield returns are calculated on an annualized model. This shows the possible earnings for locking up your cryptos for a year.

Some of the most common metrics include annual percentage yield (APY) and annual percentage rate (APR). The primary difference between them is that APR doesn’t consider compound interest, which involves plowing back your profits to increase your returns.

Still, most calculation models are simply estimates. It is difficult to accurately calculate returns on yield farming because it is a dynamic market. A yield farming strategy could deliver high returns for a while, but farmers could always adopt it *en masse*, leading to a drop in profitability. The market is quite volatile and risky for both borrowers and lenders.

**Should you try yield farming?**

**First, understand its risks**

Despite its obvious potential upside, yield farming has its risks. They include: 

* **Smart contract risks** 

Smart contracts are paperless digital codes that contain the agreement between parties on predefined rules that self executes. Smart contracts eliminate go-betweens, are cheaper and safer to conduct transactions. But, they are susceptible to attack vectors and bugs in the code. Users of popular DeFi protocols [Uniswap](https://decrypt.co/43927/ethereum-user-scammed-for-140000-in-uniswap-uni-tokens) and [Akropolis](https://www.zdnet.com/article/hacker-steals-2-million-from-cryptocurrency-service-akropolis/) have all suffered losses to smart contract scams. 

* **Impermanent loss risk** 

Yield farming requires liquidity providers to supply funds into pools to earn yields and trading fees from decentralized exchanges (DEXs). This offers LPs market-neutral returns, but it could be risky during sharp market moves. 

This risk is possible because AMMs don’t update token prices in line with movements in the market. For instance, if an asset’s price drops by 60% on a centralized exchange, the change won’t immediately reflect on a DEX.

As a result, a savvy arbitrage trader could use that narrow price gap to sell their token on a yield farming platform at a premium. LPs will eventually have to cover this difference, and incur losses when the price drops. Since their capital is locked in the pool, they can’t benefit when the price rises. One way of addressing this issue is to choose protocols that trade assets with low price slippages, such as the [WBTC and renBTC pairs on Curve.](https://taiyangzhang.medium.com/)

* **Liquidation risks** 

As with the traditional finance space, DeFi platforms use their customers’ deposits to provide liquidity to their markets. However, a problem could arise when the value of the collateral drops below the loan’s price. For instance, if you take out a loan in ETH collateralized by BTC, a price increase in ETH would result in the loan being liquidated as the value of the collateral (BTC) would be less than the value of the ETH loan.

* **Capital intensive and complicated process**

Yield farming is a capital-intensive operation. Most of the cost concern surrounds the issue of gas fees on the Ethereum network.  Josh Rager, the founder of cryptocurrency trading service Blockroots.com, took to Twitter to [complain](https://twitter.com/Josh_Rager/status/1293760986520969217?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1293760986520969217%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fdecrypt.co%2F38556%2Fethereum-fees-briefly-equal-a-us-stimulus-check) that he had to pay as much as US$1,200 in fees to purchase tokens on a DeFi project. This is more of an issue for smaller participants than for wealthier users, who have access to more capital. Smaller participants might find out that they can’t withdraw their earnings due to high gas fees.

Getting into yield farming is a risky endeavor if you have no experience in the cryptocurrency world. You could lose all your investment in one fell swoop. Invest at your own risk. The world of yield farming is fast-paced and volatile. If you decide to try your hands on yield farming, you should not invest more than you’re willing to lose.

**What the future holds for yield farming**

Yield farming uses investors’ funds to create liquidity in the market in exchange for returns. It has significant potential for growth, but it’s not without its faults.

Vitalik Buterin, the founder of Ethereum, even promised not to dip his feet into yield farming until it “stabilizes.” Several other blockchains like Polkadot and Solana have tried wooing DeFi platforms with new features. Tezos completed an upgrade dubbed “Delphi” which it claims would reduce gas fees for developers by 75%. This proposition is expected to attract DeFi developers.

**The Seven Most Popular Yield Farming Protocols**

[**1. Compound**](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/compound/) is a money market for lending and borrowing assets, where algorithmically adjusted compound interest as well the governance token COMP can be earned.

[**2. MakerDAO**](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/maker/) is a decentralized credit pioneer that lets users lock crypto as collateral assets to borrow DAI, a USD-pegged stablecoin. Interest is paid in the form of a “stability fee.” 

[**3. Aave**](https://aave.com/) is a decentralized lending and borrowing protocol to create money markets, where users can borrow assets and earn compound interest for lending in the form of the [**AAVE**](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/aave/) (previously LEND) token. Aave is also known for facilitating flash loans and credit delegation, where loans can be issued to borrowers without collateral. 

[**4. Uniswap**](https://uniswap.org/) is a hugely popular decentralized exchange (DEX) and [**automated market maker (AMM)**](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/automated-market-maker-amm) that enables users to swap almost any [**ERC20**](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/erc-20) token pair without intermediaries. Liquidity providers must stake both sides of the liquidity pool in a 50/50 ratio, and in return earn a proportion of transaction fees as well as the UNI governance token.

[**5. Balancer**](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/balancer/) is a liquidity protocol that distinguishes itself through flexible staking. It doesn’t require lenders to add liquidity equally to both pools. Instead, liquidity providers can create customized liquidity pools with varying token ratios. 

[**6. Synthetix**](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/synthetix-network-token/) is a derivatives liquidity protocol that allows users to create synthetic crypto assets through the use of [**oracles**](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/oracles-in-defi-101-a-deep-dive-by-tellor) for almost any traditional finance asset that can deliver reliable pricing data.

[**7. Yearn.finance**](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/yearn-finance-protocol/) is an automated decentralized aggregation protocol that allows yield farmers to use various lending protocols like Aave and Compound for the highest yield. Yearn.finance algorithmically seeks the most profitable yield farming services and uses rebasing to maximize their profit. Yearn.finance made waves in 2020 when its governance token [**YFI** ](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/yearn-finance/)climbed to over $40,000 in value at one stage.

Other notable yield farming protocols: [**Curve**](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/curve-finance/), [**Harvest**](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/harvest-finance/), [**Ren**](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ren/) and [**SushiSwap**](https://blog.coinmarketcap.com/2020/09/16/bullish-activity-for-bitcoin-under-the-hood-of-the-sushiswap-saga-a-data-perspective-by-intotheblock/).

gaming,Need help with steam.,"Hi all, I have been busy with my life for last 10 days and today when I tried to login to my account it asked me to put steam guard authentication code, which I know i never had on off (I know pretty stupid of me). Thinking, Steam might have enabled it as default on all accounts (as there was a large steam update when i tried to switch on steam), I checked my e-mail only to see that i was receiving no codes. However, on checking my mails I saw that my phone that was registered to my steam was removed, and there was a purchase on my steam account. Also, the person was able to add some mail.ru email id to the account - where steam was trying to send the authentication code. Fortunately, I could self recover by using my email address for now, but now I am paranoid about using my account. Steps I have taken till now:

1. recovered my steam using my email.
2. Changed my password.
3. set up mobile authentication.
4. checked if any other account activity was done - result is 0 as of now. No game was played, no inventory item was transferred etc.
5. contacted steam support to remove the game from my account that was purchased by the hijacker.

However, I still have following questions:

On close inspection of all mails from steam and my steam account, I noticed how the hacker was able to change phone and email. Basically, he brute forced himself to the steam, then when he encountered the mobile number, he purchased a worthless game worth 14 rubles I think (it shows 14 pуб). He used the card used to purchase the game as valid proof of ownership and contacted steam support saying he doesnt have access to the phone now. Steam support removed the ph. no associated and then he changed the mail id to something from ""mail.ru"". I was able to self-recover the account but wonder if:

1. he can again use the payment details as proof that he is the account owner rehijacking the account?
2. Moreover, as the payment was done from Russia, my store and wallet settings has been changed to Russian. I contacted steam support to revert it, but got reply that the setting can only be changed after i make a valid purchase from home country now. I tried buying a game with my card (from my country) but steam doesnt let me use it saying that region can only be changed once every 3 months prompting me to use a Russian federation card(which ofc i dont have). How to change my store and wallet to my original region now?

4. Professor Aggelos Kiayias recently dropped a video explaining exactly how Mithril (apparently neckbeard dungeon master talk for elf armor) is going to allow for Perfect Cardano (ADA) wallets that combine the ease of use and convenience of light wallets with the trustlessness of full node wallets. We also learned exactly how Mithril is going to work. [https://youtu.be/LhepJFCyWRk](https://youtu.be/LhepJFCyWRk)
5. In proof-of-work, bootstrapping can be done with blockheaders. This won’t do in proof-of-stake since we need information about stakeholder distribution to confirm block validity.
6. Mithril fixes this by being a cryptographic construction that enables a population of stakeholders to issue a signature consistent with certain constraints.
7. For Mithril to work in proof-of-stake, it needs three crucial properties: 1) it needs to enforce a threshold ratio of stakeholders before the signature is issued; 2) the pre-signature fragments must be independently verified and subject to public aggregation; and 3) it must be efficient in the sense that the final signature is of constant size and is logarithmically dependent on the # of stakeholders.
8. Stakeholders will issue special Mithril keys along with the normal cryptographic key material. Then at regular intervals, full nodes will test whether they can produce a pre-signature fragment. Only a random subset of stakeholders will be eligible to produce a pre-signature fragment. When a sufficient # of pre-signature fragments have been issued by eligible stakeholders then it will be possible to aggregate the fragments into a final signature.
9. This will be a checkpoint that will be verifiable with respect to previous check points all the way back to the genesis block. Such checkpoints will be cryptographic commitments of the relevant UTXOs.
10. Since the checkpoints will be trustless, a light client (i.e. wallet) will only need to verify the sequence of checkpoints up to the current time to trustlessly bootstrap.
11. The ecosystem is growing so fast, it’s hard to keep up with all the projects without these infographics at this point. [https://twitter.com/Dr\_shwetaPHD/status/1398783893638103040](https://twitter.com/Dr_shwetaPHD/status/1398783893638103040)

18. Vitalik is saying it’s highly unlikely we see ETH 2.0 before late 2022. I’m guessing that means mid 2023 which will be after two years of Cardano slaughtering the entire ETH user base. Things are looking so bad that Vitalik says he doesn’t even like using the ETH 2.0 label anymore since he knows the changes will be more incremental. This is what early capitulation sounds like guys.

37. Hedgefund Billionaire Paul Tudor Jones tells the world to buy crypto and certain other assets if the Fed doesn’t address inflation in their policy meeting that concludes on Wednesday. JP Morgan’s Jamie Dimon concurs that the current inflation is very likely not transitory.

41. While renewable energy is certainly a wonderful thing, there may be a problem with your technology when your path to compete on clean energy consumption involves you talking about harnessing the power of a whole series of volcanoes.

50. Bloomberg just published a piece called “America Should Become a Nation of Renters”. While this statement is probably extremely polarizing for Americans, it can also be argued that the death of homes as the primary investment vehicle of Americans may open up a new wave of adoption in crypto as an alternative.

54. It looks like the second biggest ETH stakepool or it's custody provider has lost it’s users private keys to $75MM in ETH. Cardano doesn’t have this problem. We get to keep custody of our crypto because we found a better way than slashing.

57. The June Cardano 360 is currently available on Youtube. [https://youtu.be/al5m14299ww](https://youtu.be/al5m14299ww)
58. We saw segments on various newer partner entities like Nervos, Orion Protocol, and Revuto. Nervos is a UTXO proof-of-work blockchain which is building a cross-chain bridge with Cardano so that you can use your ADA on Nervos dApps and vice versa. Interoperability is a big theme for Nervos and they plan to have a working testnet within a month. Orion Protocol is building a terminal that will allow for decentralized non-custodial trading across centralized and decentralized exchanges. They say this would not require you to KYC or even have an account with any of these exchanges. Revuto is an online subscription management service that recently completed a $10MM token sale on Cardano.
59. It was also revealed that Wolfram Labs, COTI, and IOHK have a three-way partnership (a ménage à tech) to build an NFT auction site. The people from Wolfram were talking about very interesting things including live minting during streaming events and automated upload to IPFS. COTI will be building out auction and bidding mechanisms in ADAPay.
60. Professor Aggelos Kiayias gave us an update on research including that Ouroboros Chronos and Hydra papers have both been accepted into conferences/journals. Chronos will provide Cardano with a global concept of time that doesn’t rely on any outside timekeeper. Prof. Kiayias also pointed out that Hydra is distinguishable from other layer two protocols in that the scripting language is identical to that of the base layer in Cardano such that any dApp that can run on Cardano will run on the Hydra L2. This is a huge plus and superior to many other layer two solutions in other ecosystems where the base layer dApps will not run on layer two. Finally, the Mithril paper has been submitted for peer review. It will provide Cardano light wallets with Succinct Non-interactive Arguments of Knowledge that will give us the best of both worlds: no delays for syncing as in full node wallets while still preserving trustlessness.
61. Finally, the Goguen Summit will be in late September. Sign up now at [summit.cardano.org](http://summit.cardano.org/).
62. The Fed is once again STRONGLY signalling to us that they are going to regulate stablecoins. The Fed is also specifically calling out Tether for the first time. You need to be thinking about how stablecoin regulation might affect your favorite Cardano DeFi or other project.

63. People are starting to realize that the Stakehound private key loss in ETH may attract unwanted regulatory attention to Ethereum 2.0 while this problem could never have occurred in Cardano. Also, only a few days later another ETH stakepool (this time SharedStake...the sixth biggest ETH Stakepool) allegedly experiences a rugpull that some are valuing at over $30MM. This is another problem that could not happen in Cardano staking. It feels like we stepped into the ring, they rang the bell, and ETH just started punching itself in the head. Eventually it’s going to KO itself.

CryptoCurrency,➡️ What are differences between APY &amp; APR ??,"# General Conclusion

APR and APY are used in many yield farming programs in DeFi protocols. However, they are not the same thing! We, the participants in the market, are not only investing but actively receiving yields by farming and staking DeFi tokens. So these basic terms are not only important, but they are also information that helps you to invest more effectively.

Both are related to returns. But how are they different? Why are they not interchangeable? We discuss that in today's newsletter.

# Definition

APR stands for Annual Percentage Rate. It is the actual annual rate of return, **NOT** taking into account the effect of compound interest.

APY stands for Annual Percentage Yield. It is the actual annual rate of return, taking into account the effect of compound interest.

Who uses what? APY is better to calculate your returns on investment while APR is more common in lending.

&gt;Quick math: which do you think is higher? APY, the one that considers compounding.

# What Are They Different?

## APR

For example, a yield farming program offers an APR  
 of 100%/yr. You use $1000 to join this program. One year later you will receive $2,000, where $1000 is the initial capital and $1000 is APR  
.

Once you see the APR, it is possible to immediately calculate how much profit will be earned at the end of the period. This profit comes from your staking or farming, so just join at the beginning to get the result for APR interest.

### Formular

APR = r x N

Where:

r: The interest rate of the year;

N: Interest period (N = 1, means 1 year).

## APY

APY is another way of calculating the percentage of real profit you will receive.

&gt;What will you get if you receive profit every day from staking and you will add that to your principle and earn interest on that **every day**?

If you have an APR  
 of 100%/yr with getting daily profit, you have to divide APR  
 by 365 days to calculate the interest received daily (0.27%). Then reinvest this interest continuously every day. The amount you get is $2,714.57, where $1000 is the initial capital and $1714.57 is APY  
.

Assuming you participate in farming pairs on Solana's Raydium application, I also combine Step Finance to know the APR  
 and APY  
 of these farming pairs. Typically, I am staking $RAY on Raydium (current project APR is 35.33%), with $1,000 you farm at the beginning of the year to the end of the year, the total income will be $1,423.51.

### Formular

APY = (1+r)\^n - 1

In which:

r: The interest rate of the period;

n: Interest period (n=1 means 1 day).

# Awareness

As such, today's projects often offer 2 ratios of APR and APY to show users what the rate of return is currently available. However, some projects that give daily, 7-day interest rings directly provide APY. This has two implications:

* First, displaying APY  
 will produce a larger percentage than APR  
, making brave people feel that they will receive more profit.
* Secondly, the APY  
 interest is only true if the user reinvests (restake, refarm) continuously in the allowed period (e.g. when receiving rewards, immediately stake).

Today we see a lot of aggregator protocols already using this ability to increase profits, continuously reinvesting within the capacity of the original protocols. This is really good if the transaction costs are not significant. Hopefully, we can find those solutions in Layer 2.

 **TLDR**:

Understanding the two terms of APR  
 and APY  
 becomes even more important in DeFi today, as nearly all protocols with yield farming fields display these numbers. Knowing them well is not only for understanding and executing different strategies and calculating real profits.",cryptocurrency

CryptoCurrency,"Deficit spending, inflation implications and how it may affect crypto prices by [arandom_econstudent]","Today's debate question by user: u/Papa_canks
""I’m afraid us first-worlders may be looking into our future when we view places like South America. Deficit spending has future inflation implications I’m afraid. Tough for central banks to avoid this death spiral. A failing currency leads to more central authority power grabs in order to avoid what little economic progress is left from leaking out. We will see how different countries get themselves out of this situation. Write about your thoughts on how your country got to where it is"" 

A.How my country got were it is: we have a cult around public figures, specially Perón, who was a millitary leader in 1940-1970 like Mussolini. He helped destroy the institutions that control the power the president (in that moment dictator) had. There are no checks and balances in power. Regarding inflation, we've had a huge deficit for 70 out of the last 75 years, we finance the deficit with unbacked monetary emisions thus resulting in high increasing inflation. (50%+)

B.Trilema of public finances: this Is the problem regarding public spending (fiscal policy), central banks autonomy (monetary policy), and debt management with capital flows. If you are in equilibrium, and raise public spending you will either have to print more money (seniorage) affecting monetary policy and thus prices (by rising inflation) or raise the amount of debt, which ultimately has to be repaid.

C.Deficit spending: I don't think the USA may face a severe inflation like my country (50% or more) because they know how harmful a high inflation is, so they will cut spending in order to stabilizate prices (in order to avoid the greater evil). Moreover, the USA exports inflation when it's inflation rises to countries that also use their currency, such as mine. Regarding debt management, the USA has indeed a big budget deficit, but the debt dynamic seems to converge to a sustainable debt in the long term taking everything into account. (If the USA was really going to crash so hard, why is no one in the markets paniking?)

D.Inflation implications: I believe inflation will end the year around 4.5-5.5%, which is what most forecasts are projecting. Although there might be a slight aceleration in inflation, I believe the economic reactivation post corona will raise money demand and prevent inflation to going into the 6-8% rate. Aditionally, if this were to happen, I think the FED would start doing a tighter monetary policy to de-acelerate inflation.

E. How it may affect crypto prices: With inflation and the prospects of infinite emisions of dollars imply that crypto prices will rise in the long term, but only those projects that survive. 
In the short term, as QE (quantitative easing) slows down, this implies less money in circulation which usually leads to lower growth in market indexes (S&amp;P, DOW JONES etc) and this seems to be the case for crypto. So a tighter monetary policy might affect the crypto prices in the short term.

I tried to be as brief as posible because on the last post many claimed I was too extensive. If anyone has questions I will answer in the comments.

Bitcoin,The Bitcoin Standard book,"Reading this book by Saifedean Ammous, currently at chapter 8, and I must say it is so far the biggest eye opener as to how everything is extremely off and messed up beyond recognition, driven by relentless propaganda.

CryptoCurrency,ICOs vs Venture Capital - The Other Crypto Revolution,"Have you ever tried to get venture capital? Me, either. Because it's pretty damn hard. It's an entirely different skill set than design, invention, and creation. Quite often, someone well-equipped to create a dynamic product is ill-equipped to handle the business end of things. It's sort of like being an author, and submitting your work to a literary agent. You can have the best novel in the world, but if they don't like your cover letter, you can't even get your foot in the door.

ICOs, I maintain, are revolutionary in and of themselves, crypto aside. It's pretty much Kickstarter on a grand scale.

Think about that. To be able to raise hundreds of millions of dollars for a project, and only answering to the market and end users. Literally doing an end run around cutthroat VC gatekeepers.

Now, a lot of VC are a fine bunch. But, damn, if you don't pretty much hand them everything on a silver platter, along with a nice piece of ownership, you are going to be dead in the water. Or, you would have been, in the past.

The times, they are achangin'.

There's a downside, of course. The disruptions in the market as people scramble for the latest ERC-20 issue. The ICOs that are clearly just a cash grab. The epic hacks.

No wonder the feds are cracking down. The blockchain revolution is spawning further revolutions, and venture capital is a pretty important field for this to happen in. Innovation drives economies. What we're seeing here are just the opening salvos in a new civil war that we just might have a chance of winning.

So my friend made some terrible financial decisions between the ages of 19-21 and his wife has some medical bills and student loans that together put them about $11k in debt. Currently they pay about $1600 a month that goes mostly towards interest and at present would take about 11 years to pay off with interest rates between 25‐30%. Their combined income is about $2250/month and they both have terrible credit scores. The debt breakdown is as follows: 
Snap on tools: $1832
Sallie Mae: $732

Nothing but skin and bone. I picked him up in my arms and got into the back of my truck with him and had my wife drive us home (about .5 miles).

At home I placed him in the bathtub and began the process of bathing him it’s dawn dish soap to help with getting the fleas under control and dog shampoo to help his skin and coat. I cut enough mats that were potato chip size to fill up our bathroom trash can.

We boiled some raw chicken breast as white rice and fed him in small quantities every 3 hours throughout the night praying he would survive.

He finally stood on his own and went outside and used the bathroom #1 and 2 and everything seemed okay. His back legs were extremely weak and he would wobble when hiking his leg.

We took him to our vet first thing this morning and received the bad news.

He was well over 8 years old, heart worms so bad the vet said at his age he would never recover from them. His breathing was extremely labored and his heartbeat was all over the charts.

As much as it saddened us, the vet was right, the right thing to do was end his suffering. He was just suffering with too little fight left. So we reminded him he’s a good boy. Hugged and petted him.  And stayed with him until his last breaths. Though we are sad; we are at peace knowing his last night on earth he was loved, had a warm dry place to sleep, and some good food. We named him Taco. He is why I hodl.

RIP Taco unk-2021

personalfinance,Good credit but low income. Can I still get good financing terms?,"I'm a US Citizen repatriating back to the US with my wife. This is a planned out project, we have savings to last over a year, etc.

During the transition my income will likely be low as I job-search.

My credit score is excellent, 750+, I have various US credit cards and bank accounts, a retirement and brokerage account.

Is there any chance I will be able to access good financing terms for auto-loans or will my low income push me up to higher interest rates despite a good credit score?

I've never had a loan in the US before since I've never needed one, and while I can get some estimates online, most of those calculators just do soft pulls on your credit, and I know the actual process will involve a hard credit and a look at my finances, so I was hoping for some real world experiences so I know what to expect.

personalfinance,FOMO with Refinancing Mortgage but would paying off CC debt be better?,"First time poster. We've been working on saving money and paying off debt for years now, but haven't really made much progress. I'm incredibly thankful to all of the fantastic information on this sub and the wiki; it's been really informative. 

I searched the sub and see a lot of positive feedback for refinancing, but I'm at a loss as to what the best move would be. I have a spending problem and thus a debt problem that we are buckling down on now.  I don't want to miss out on the low mortgage rates with refinancing, but I am worried that we need to handle our budget and get down our credit debt first. Our other option would be to do a balance transfer. 

Using mtgprofessor, refinancing will save us around 5K in one year in interest for our mortgage, but would it be better to get all of our debt down while only saving around 2K in interest?

Credit Scores: 752 and 814

Current Mortgage: $143K with 27.75 years left @ 4.5% Interest

[Better.com](https://Better.com) Mortgage Offer: $147441 for 30 years @ 2.625% 

There were several different options to play with, but this one had the best interest rate with no points. Closing costs are rolled into that total loan estimate. Initially, we were looking at a cash-out refinance, but it wasn't an option offered. I'm going to call a local credit union to see what they have to offer.

Assets (Only cash): 5519.93, I estimate that we can use $2000 a month to avalanche with a tight budget

Credit Cards:

* $7125.73 @ 12.9%
* $2898.78 @ 16.24%
* $740.86 @ 20.24%
* Two paid off cards: 0 @ 21.99 and 0 @ 25% (Balance Transfers)

Car Loan: $4445.80 @ 10.74%

My student loans are outrageous: 63K. I'm one of the millennials that was tricked with ""student debt is good debt"" and after making minimum payments for 6 years I owe more now than I took out. This makes my DTI really high. While I know it is a risk, I'm at teacher and I am 6 years in to the PSLF program that will forgive my debt in 4 more years. For payments to qualify, you have to be on an Income-Based Repayment plan and paying more than the minimum will mess up the count. So, I would like to consider this debt off the table when looking at debt repayment.",finance

personalfinance,Comparison of 529 Account vs. Series I Savings Bonds,"I've posted this as a comment, but I feel like it's good advice so I'm making a post.  Hopefully, if I am wrong, someone can point it out in the comments, and everyone can laugh at my expense (but save more money for their children).

My daughter was born late last year, and I've begun saving for her.

What comes to mind, obviously, is a [529 account](https://www.fidelity.com/529-plans/faqs-about-accounts).  As far as I can tell, a 529 account has these features:

* Interest rate largely determined by the Fed Funds Rate (some states offer a minimum of 2%)
* Interest not subject to Federal Taxes (unless you withdraw for non-college)
* Interest not subject to State tax in 30 states (unless you withdraw for non-college)
* Penalty for non-college withdrawal is 10% of earnings withdrawn + State/Federal taxation on the earnings

But when I've been investigating other possibilities, it seems like the [Series I Savings Bond](https://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/products/prod_ibonds_glance.htm) is actually quite superior, for the time being:

* Inflation-adjusted APY, currently 3.54% adjusted semiannually
* Interest is (State) tax-free always, but taxed Federally *unless you withdraw for college!*
* No penalty for non-college withdrawal
* Penalty for withdrawals before 5 yrs is 3 months' of interest payments
* $10,000/yr limit on savings bond purchases (so you've got to start early)

So from what I can tell, the Series I is a much better choice for saving in general, and confers all the benefits (which mostly are focused on taxes) that a 529 account could confer *with a much better interest rate.* If my daughter does go to college, she won't pay any taxes on the earnings in the Series I bond. If she *doesn't* go to college, she can withdraw and only pay Federal tax, instead of paying Federal + State + 10%.

Do I sound insane to anyone who actually knows what they are doing?  To me, this seems cut and dry:  do the Series I to the max.",finance

The email appears to be from TrackingUpdates@fedex.com and I can't find anything in the email or LTS signature to contradict that. However I found the real fedex tracker by googling fedex tracking and going on the actual fedex site and put in the tracking number and it works, and it does appear to be going from georgia to my city (it doesn't say specific address). 

I don't see anything unusual on my credit card history.  Both the email and fedex's real tracker says it was created today and should arrive in two days. No idea what the object is buy fedex says it's 19 pounds which is fairly big...

stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Thursday, July 15, 2021","**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, July 15, 2021**

Stocks broadly fell today as market participants continued digesting Q2 earning reports, reassurances from the Federal Reserve that current inflationary pressures is temporary and new economic reports that suggest a slowdown in the global growth rate. After recording several new intraday highs this week, the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) slipped, closing 0.34% and 0.7% down respectively. The Russell 2000 (IWM) fell for the third straight day this week, closing 0.54% down.

Markets seem to have become jittery following the release of the June Consumer and Producer Price Index (CPI &amp; PPI). (CPI), which measures changes in the prices of consumer goods, rose 0.9% in June, accelerating from May’s 0.6%. Year-on-year, the CPI is up 5.4%, exceeding the 4.9% expected by economists and the fastest rate of growth since 2008. Core CPI, which excludes the volatile price energy and food and is therefore considered a more accurate representation of general price inflation, was up 4.5% year-on-year as prices bounced from last year’s pandemic-era lows. PPI, which measures the average changes in prices received by domestic producers for their output rose 1% in June, accelerating to a 7.3% rise year-on-year, while still reflecting base effects. Core PPI rse 5.5%. This is the fastest rate of increase since 2009.

Yesterday, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell gave his semi-annual monetary policy testimony before Congress, where he largely reiterated the same thing he has been saying for months. Powell said “inflation will likely remain elevated in the coming months before moderating” and that the US economy was “still a ways” off from reaching the threshold of “substantial further progress” that would trigger the Central Bank to roll-back pandemic-era policies. In short, Powell basically said while he expects higher inflation prints in the coming months, pressures are transitory and due to pandemic era disruptions and the Fed’s goal for economic recovery have not been met. [Here is Powell’s complete testimony, but here are two of his most important quotes.](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/testimony/powell20210714a.htm)

**On the labor market:** “Conditions in the labor market have continued to improve, but there is still a long way to go. Labor demand appears to be very strong; job openings are at a record high, hiring is robust, and many workers are leaving their current jobs to search for better ones. Indeed, employers added 1.7 million workers from April through June. However, the unemployment rate remained elevated in June at 5.9 percent, and this figure understates the shortfall in employment, particularly as participation in the labor market has not moved up from the low rates that have prevailed for most of the past year. Job gains should be strong in coming months as public health conditions continue to improve and as some of the other pandemic-related factors currently weighing them down diminish.”

**On inflation:** “Inflation has increased notably and will likely remain elevated in coming months before moderating. Inflation is being temporarily boosted by base effects, as the sharp pandemic-related price declines from last spring drop out of the 12-month calculation. In addition, strong demand in sectors where production bottlenecks or other supply constraints have limited production has led to especially rapid price increases for some goods and services, which should partially reverse as the effects of the bottlenecks unwind. Prices for services that were hard hit by the pandemic have also jumped in recent months as demand for these services has surged with the reopening of the economy”.

In other news, new economic data coming out of China, the first country to experience and begin recovering from the virus, is showing a marked slowdown in economic growth. The world's second largest economy expanded at a 7.9% rate in the second quarter from a year ago, according to the National Bureau of Statistics, missing consensus estimates for an 8.0% rise and decelerating sharply from the first quarter's 18.3% increase. In response, the People’s Bank of China signalled it was cutting the amount of cash that banks must hold in reserve, a move that suggests the economic recovery in China may be slowing down. The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) will reduce the reserve requirement ratio by 0.5 percentage point for most banks, according to a [statement](http://www.pbc.gov.cn/goutongjiaoliu/113456/113469/4287599/index.html) published Friday. That will unleash about 1 trillion yuan ($154 billion) of long-term liquidity into the economy and will be effective on July 15, the central bank said. The reduction was signaled earlier this week, when the State Council, China’s equivalent of a cabinet, hinted the central bank would make more liquidity available to banks so they could lend to smaller firms hurt by rising costs. The timing and magnitude of the move, coming a week before second-quarter growth data, suggests worries about the economy’s outlook and was a decisive shift away from policy tightening, which most, if not all, recovering economies are pursuing.  Just to put into more familiar terms, this would be like if the Federal Reserve suddenly turned around and said rather than discussing tapering quantitative easing, it would instead propose pumping more money into the economy.

In good news, the Weekly Unemployment Report showed new jobless claims fall to pandemic-era lows. 

* **Initial jobless claims, week ended July 10:** 360,000 vs. 350,000 expected and a revised 386,000 during prior week 
* **Continuing claims, week ended July 3:** 3.241 million vs. 3.300 million expected and a revised 3.367 million during prior week

**Highlights** 

* Import prices were up 1% in June over May, adding to a 1.4% increase the month prior. This marks the eighth straight month import prices have risen and brings the annual price increase to 11.2%
* Netflix (NFLX) has announced it plans to eventually stream video games on its platform and hired a former Electronic Arts (EA) executive to lead the push. 
* As earnings season continues, big bank stocks continue falling despite, in most cases, posting great earnings. 
* Square (SQ) announced it has acquired Crew, and app that enables real-time access to communicate with frontline hourly workers and assist with scheduling and other managerial services.
* According to Facebook (FB), the company is pledging $1 billion to support content creators on its platforms through the end of 2022. Content creators will receive a monthly bonus if they hit milestones for earnings Stars, a form of digital tipping that fans can use to pay their favorite creators during live-streamed videos. Instagram's bonus programs will include incentives to use Reels, its copycat TikTok feature that showcases short-form video clips. Creators will earn money based on how their Reels videos perform, the company said.

investing,what is the difference between 2020/2021 and 1999/2000?,"How is the dot com bubble any different from the inflated assets today?

It seems like the catalysts that led to the dot com bubble are the same ones we see in todays investing space as well


It seems like low interest rates led to leverage in the system, and once the fed started reeling in this leverage with higher interest rates, a classic blown off top occurred. Am I missing something?

If that's the case, and if we're gonna have a repeat, then I don't think the market will wait for the rate increases as long as it did in the past given that the fed didn't give advance notice in the past. Perhaps the volatility won't be as significant with the advanced notice that powell provides, but it'll still be a correction

Also, I am aware that our generations dot com bubble may actually be confined to the digital currency, meme stock, and SPAC space in the sense that those areas soaked up all the volatility and preserved the SPY and nasdaq from experiencing it as much. If that's true, I still think a correction is likely",finance
devops,Jumping into Devops too early in my software developer career ?,"I’m about one year into the field as a Junior Software Developer. My job is very full stack and I’ve touched a lot of code in the last year. Backend, working with API’s, some basic SQL, building out two websites using Vue.js, and maintaining some pretty rough legacy applications among other things.

Because of some culture issues (understaffed, underpaid, small company, owner doesn’t understand how SDLC works etc.) I’ve started looking for other opportunities. I just got referred by a friend of mine who is a hiring manager at a large bank. It’s for a Devops Engineer role. They know my level of experience and still want to interview me. I feel like I’m pretty under qualified as I have very little (tbh none) operations experience. 

I’ve been studying up to prepare for the interview and the manager told me to look into Terraform, Ansible and just IaC in general. It’s all very interesting to me but I would anticipate a very steep learning curve if I were able to get an offer.

I’m wondering if making such a drastic career trajectory change this early on would be unwise. I feel like I’m still just scratching the surface of straight software development and if I wasn’t a fan of working in Devops it would be tough to get back into a software eng role. On the other hand, this could be a great opportunity to learn a lot more about the operations. 

From what Ive read online, most Devops roles involve a lot of collaboration and team efforts. I’m very much so an extrovert and some of my favorite experiences in this current role is when I get to work with others on projects instead of just being silo’d away at my desk writing code. But it’s hard for me to know if I would like either path better at this point . I like solving problems, I like helping people and I like building things. I don’t know if I’m necessarily married to being a software dev.

This role would also be a significant raise (50k/yr-&gt;atleast 70k/yr).

Should I seriously consider this opportunity, or just keep looking for a different software engineer role?",technology

Everyone will have the wallet on their phone and all their transactions will be traceable. It will be a cashless society. The FED will be able to decide what you are allowed to purchase because all FED coins are connected with them. There could even be a social score system where you get limitations on what you can do with your money depending on your behaviour in society. Sickening right.

The lease agreement is a 20 yr fixed contract at a lease rate of $0.17 (~$102/month). Vivint will operate and maintain the system. Workmanship guarantee. Transferrable to new home owners. No upfront cost but no tax benefit. I'm able to lease for 6 years and then purchase it at year 6 at FMV.

If I purchase it'll cost a little over ~16k. Cost is added to price of home. I am eligible on recieving up to 26% on fed tax return (what does this mean exactly?). Comes with a 25 yr performance warranty and 10 yr workmanship warranty. 

Is this a good system and is it worth it to lease or purchase? I have no clue where to start and any help is greatly appreciated.

personalfinance,Where to put inheritance?,"Hi there. I am a mid-20-something and I consider myself pretty financially literate and capable with my  modest financial system setup. 

A little background/context. I graduated college without any debt, have a good 4-month emergency fund saved up, and a credit score of 800 so I think I am doing fairly well. At this moment I just finished a very low-paying Americorps service term and will be unemployed for the next few months as I look for full-time employment, but I will be living at home and working a bs retail job in the meantime so I will not have to dip into my emergency fund or savings. I live a simple and modest lifestyle, and am confident I can find employment that will allow me to support my modest lifestyle within the next 3 months. 

Last year my grandfather passed away and I received a windfall of about $25,000 in inheritance. His intention was that I use that to help buy a house one day, and that is what I intend to use it for. I have never dealt with a chunk of money this large, and I want to make sure I am smart and careful about it. 

Since I got it, it has been sitting in a high-yield savings account  while I figure out what to do with it. Since interest rates are so low right now, it is currently earning 0.50% APY which I am aware is actually losing value due to inflation. 

My first question is: what should I do with this money, so that it will earn a decent return over the next 5-10 years until I am ready to purchase a house? Should I put it in a CD account? Invest it? Something else? I've heard a little bit about ""ETFs"" and am wondering if that is something I should consider. 

There are other things I am wondering about using the money for. 

For one, I may decide to go to grad school in the next couple years since that is pretty much the requirement for decent white-collar employment these days, so I am also considering using the money for education. I am very averse to doing so, since a graduate degree is likely going to be $50-100k+, which would vaporize my inheritance as well as put me into debt, and I am very debt-averse. 

Second, my car is on its last leg and will likely give out on me in the next year or so. Would it be wise to use this money for a car, or should I just finance a car and make payments?

&amp;#x200B;

Just looking for any and all advice about what to do with a large windfall such as this. Thanks!",finance

So the only way CBDCs would have any use or efficiency gains over a visa card is if they all live on either ethereum as erc20 tokens or they are all interoperable with the lightning network and lightning invoices.

Heres the thing, in either scenario that would mean lightning bitcoin or wrapped btc would be able to be sent to any wallet that uses CBDCs and spent anywhere that accepts CBDCs.

CBDCs will massively boost the use and functionality of bitcoin itself. It might take time for the masses to abandon central bank monetary policy and adopt bitcoin monetary policy but being able to spend bitcoin anywhere in the meantime would be huge.",cryptocurrency

CryptoCurrency,r/CryptoCurrency has sleep cycles.. and more [Charts],"*Reposting, because charts didn't show up last time.*

&amp;#x200B;

We are a combined, partly digital living organism. I decided to study Round 15 Dailies in order to get a better understanding of us as whole. Below are my key findings.

**Charts and descriptions**

&amp;#x200B;

[ \[c01\] This histogram shows the mean number of each Daily's comments grouped by Daily hour. Clearly, r\/CryptoCurrency is the least active during hours 1-11. This pattern becomes much easier to spot for any particular single Daily, once you know the pattern. I'm still not sure, when's the best time to submit top-level Daily comments for max exposure. Daily hour 0 says First! ](https://preview.redd.it/y9rjuo1c4hb71.png?width=746&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d5567e8f04258b3982d7e46f04692248c820e1da)

&amp;#x200B;

[ \[c02\] This histogram shows, which age users create the most top-level comments per Day. Top-level comments are thread starters in Daily. Clearly, youngest generations are very active. ](https://preview.redd.it/kndhkyri4hb71.png?width=754&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b468429413c3ce635cdd2e406882f4ebdc1f0ce0)

&amp;#x200B;

[ \[c03\] This histogram shows how many Moons each user age combined earned in Round 15. There's a clear correlation between \[c02\] and this histogram. ](https://preview.redd.it/8goysy3m4hb71.png?width=774&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d66f3ca01160091f2510d776c0b0d58da33cc833)

&amp;#x200B;

[ \[c04\] This histogram groups active Daily top-level comment authors by user ages. Once again, we can clearly see that newest users outnumber older users in the Dailies. There's a slight exception for age 15, which is great, since we need OGs. ](https://preview.redd.it/giemx8fq4hb71.png?width=758&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3e1f74593d972a41e1138b031d94e6f725a8e6e1)

&amp;#x200B;

[ \[c05\] This scatterplot shows the relation between average number of daily comments\/user\/day vs. logarithm of how many Moons were earned in Round 15 for such commenting activity. As we can see, some users post very frequently and indeed hit Moons cap, while there are also those users, who interact with Daily less frequently yet still can hit Moon cap. I suppose, they found ways to earn Moons outside of the Daily, maybe in New. If necessary, I can filter certain user ages out of this scatterplot chart, e.g., older users of age 15 never post more than 5 Daily comments per day. ](https://preview.redd.it/674rbjls4hb71.png?width=757&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4eb652d37d845b9a40bc8fb684ecca3da4e43a4b)

&amp;#x200B;

[\[c06\] This bonus histogram shows, when sub users mention Moons in the Daily the most. Clearly, days of Snapshot and Distribution matter.](https://preview.redd.it/a69saxau4hb71.png?width=744&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=699e2852b9dda999f854a06215559445a6ddfe78)

&amp;#x200B;

**Discussion**

* I have previously learned that Daily contains enough information to make important conclusions about the whole sub, e.g., for predicting Moons to Karma ratio.
* New generation of sub users leads the discussion in the Daily. Most likely, this same generation tries to lead the New as well. I wonder, how many of those from the new generation read the cc Expanded Rules ;)
* Chart \[c01\] about Daily's sleep cycles and circadian rhythms is based on GMT+0.

&amp;#x200B;

**Methods**

*Split-apply-combine* methodology.

Python and python libraries:

* numpy and pandas for data processing
* matplotlib for charts
* praw for reddit

No need to ask me how I got here; clearly I was raised by heathens..

I want to refinance my private student loans only (unless you can change my mind).. My main question is that when I shop lenders for the best interest rate, does that mean a hard inquiry on my credit each time I apply for a quote from each potential lender? Or is it a soft inquiry each time I apply for a quote and then a hard inquiry once I accept an offer? 

Also, once I refinance, does the loan balance affect my credit score? Does my DTI affect my credit score? or both?

CryptoCurrency,Here’s what our community has achieved,"Our community, not just us here at r/CryptoCurrency, but every single crypto investor in the whole world, have helped contribute to something that really can only be achieved here and now. 

The people who got in early and were ridiculed by the media, and then those of us who got in later, during the start of the pandemic, the ones who saw the potential in crypto amidst a sea of FUD against it, we, together, have created something huge.

Bitcoin is the 10th most valuable thing in the world, and it was us, millennials and younger, who hold 5% of the wealth compared to boomers who perfected a system to take from us, who pushed for that to happen.

Stablecoin interest rates are now the only reliable investment that’ll beat inflation for you, the stock markets in an uncertain place, and bonds are a joke. 

A system that could make those who were unfortunate enough to be born into societies which have not provided anything for them and give them a spot in the world economy, regardless of whether some snob in a suit decides whether it’s worth their money to provide a bank. 

A system which could hold governments accountable for how they spend, and stop the few being able to control how the many live and spend, from extortionate fees just to send money, to a complete freezing of someone’s bank account because they spent money in a place that they didn’t like.

And a system which could remove the need for middlemen, and guarantee honesty in trade through smart contracts.

That’s what we are a part of, and, being early, that’s what we are helping to grow around the world for everyone to reap the benefits of, now and I’m the future.

So, pat yourselves on the back everyone, dust yourselves off, HODL through this bear market, and just wait to see what crypto brings in the not-so-distant future.",cryptocurrency

# However, there are two reasons why the CPI is really higher than listed: ‘[owners’ equivalent rent of residences](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-05-13/april-cpi-housing-may-be-inflation-s-hidden-danger)’ and ‘[hedonic quality adjustments](https://www.epsilontheory.com/im-trying-to-understand-hedonic-adjustments/).

I highly recommend reading each of the linked articles before we dive into each section, as I am sure they are going to explain this way better than I fear I am about to butcher! The owners’ equivalent reporting is linked to April’s report, but the concepts hold true for us here in June.

# [Owners’ equivalent rent of residences](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-05-13/april-cpi-housing-may-be-inflation-s-hidden-danger)

Housing costs (rent and homeowners) are included in the CPI as services and account for about one-third of the overall CPI.

[ This is big, but it barely moves despite the surging housing and rent costs EXPLODING!!!](https://preview.redd.it/bqtov1hk4hb71.png?width=957&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d1caf356d29c4951adaf0d9a385fbd32ef46509d)

From the article on owners’ equivalent, the Case-Shiller Home Price Index, which measures the price changes over time for *the same house* and is, therefore, an appropriate measure of house price inflation is also BLOWING UP:

https://preview.redd.it/ym0cyhlh5hb71.png?width=1462&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a5b705e9231bf7146dc33e44e39a22bf3db4c2d1

# So Jellyfish, how the hell is this out-of-control price inflation getting missed in the CPI report?!?!!?

Simple, **they just don’t track it**. It is survey-based, and follows what homeowners *think* their home *might rent* for, hence the name, “owners’ equivalent rent of residences.”

Thus, this is the first way, through gimmicky accounting, that the CPI is able to be kept artificially low. However, there do appear to be cracks in this story forming. For example, hotels (lodging away from home) is a small piece of the pie (.9% of CPI), but it isn’t impacted by the homeownership and rent fuckery from above. **Prices jumped by 7.9% in June, and are up 16.9% year over year.**

I grant that prices may be catching up to where they used to be, but this appears to be a lot like rents across the country: urban area hotels that are just now coming back online as places open back up but hotels that cater to people who have wanted to get away, especially areas around national parks for example), have been booked solid, and prices have jumped.

On to the second piece of trickery:

# [hedonic quality adjustments](https://www.epsilontheory.com/im-trying-to-understand-hedonic-adjustments/)

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/g2849x3p5hb71.png?width=1463&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7c4256e1c3cd5195fb4a4c55ac33e7b816311774)

The CPI would have you believe from the chart above that used car prices dropped before this recent bout of craziness we are seeing. This is ridiculous, prices have obviously gone up!

However, because the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) uses “hedonic quality adjustments” to account for improvements in vehicles over the years (for example, from a six-speed manual transmission to a 10-speed electronically controlled transmission). *The price increases estimated to be associated with “quality improvements” are removed from the CPI for new and used vehicles.*

The CPI is supposed to measure price changes of the **same item** over time. However, when the item is improved then it’s no longer the same item, and the price increase is not inflation because it reflects a new (and theoretically) better product.

In reality, these tricks are causing purposeful, and very bipartisan understatement of inflation as measured by CPI—same as with the housing data. How can one not conclude that the idea is to keep the general public in the dark?!?

# What does it all mean?

A couple of things: The CPI number released yesterday is a joke because it heavily understated housing and other gimmicky tricks. However, other categories are showing sustained prices increases. Yes, spike-like used cars cannot last (I don’t think?) and appear to be coming down a bit?

[ But does anyone think we are going to see enough deflation to bring prices back into check? They will come down a little but stay high! ](https://preview.redd.it/dimscm066hb71.png?width=2866&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a980164e37ad90260ef8f5277c43c6a280f4fc8d)

I think what we are likely to see in the coming months is ups and downs of the monthly inflation rate that will give The Fed and politicians false hopes of declining inflation, followed by increases that obliterate these hopes.

**What’s worse, as we covered above, we still don’t know the ACTUAL inflation rates because of the foolery around housing and how the BLS runs wild with overly liberal hedonic quality adjustments.**

# I believe in this environment, cryptocurrencies have a real opportunity to shine as their value cannot be inflated away like the purchasing power of the dollar.

# All of this is happening in the backdrop of the Fed still plowing away with [$120 billion in assets purchases each month](https://www.wsj.com/articles/central-bank-will-begin-reducing-bond-purchases-well-before-raising-interest-rates-powell-says-11618421656):

https://i.redd.it/acyobwqm6hb71.gif

$40 billion a month in mortgage-backed securities. This will continue to depress mortgage rates and **only continues to add gasoline to the inflation fire**.

$80 billion in Treasury securities a month (with policy rates near 0%): represses short-term and long-term interest rates in general, and inflates asset prices and consumer prices, which **further DESTROYS the purchasing power of the dollar**.

While the rest of the world's banks are acting, The Fed still claims this inflation is “transitory.”

Hell or high water, they seem intent on trying to follow the playbook from the last crisis:

1. End asset purchases.
2. After the balance sheets quit growing then hike rates.
3. *maybe* shrink the balance sheet after raising rates.

This approach worked 'well' last time because inflation was so low. As covered above, that is not the environment we are in at this time--people's mindsets have changed about inflation, these prices are getting paid and inflation is running rampant!

However, while the Fed is asleep at the printer, other world banks are beginning to take action.

The Bank of Canada announced it is reducing its purchases of Government of Canada bonds to C$2 billion a week, (previously C$3 billion a week). It noted inflation has risen 3.6% year-over-year.

This is in the face of the previous action:

Canada announced the first reduction in QE back in October last year, from C$5 billion to C$4 billion, when it also ended buying mortgage-backed securities. In March 2021, it started unwinding its liquidity facilities, citing [“moral hazard”](https://www.bankofcanada.ca/2021/03/market-stress-relief-role-bank-canadas-balance-sheet/) as the reason. In April, it announced a further reduction, to C$3 billion, citing [“signs of extrapolative expectations and speculative behavior”](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-bank-of-canada-governor-says-red-hot-housing-market-showing-signs-of/) in the housing market.

# England

The Bank of England [announced in May](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/monetary-policy-summary-and-minutes/2021/may-2021) that it would reduce QE, winding down the bond purchases from £4.4 billion a week to £3.4 billion a week.

The Bank of England denied that it is reducing QE, calling it an “operational decision” that “should not be interpreted as a change in the stance of monetary policy.”

The reason this does not count, [according to BoE governor Andrew Bailey at the post-meeting press conference](https://www.morningstar.com/news/marketwatch/20210506583/bailey-says-reduction-in-bank-of-england-bond-purchases-isnt-tapering-markets-seem-to-agree), is that the BoE didn’t change its “fixed amounts” of its overall QE target of £895 billion, it’s just buying less per week to get to this target.

# Japan

The Bank of Japan on [July 2nd showed](https://www.boj.or.jp/en/statistics/boj/other/acmai/release/2021/ac210630.htm/) that its total assets fell by ¥7.7 trillion (\~$70 billion) at the end of June compared to the end of May. Balance at ¥717 trillion (\~$6.5 trillion).

In the statement, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand

said that in addition to **“near-term spikes in headline CPI inflation,” driven by “one-off” or “temporary” events, it expects “more persistent consumer price inflation pressure” to build over time “due to rising domestic capacity pressures and growing labor shortages.”**

**“The Committee agreed \[with the government\] that the recent rate of growth in house prices remains unsustainable.”**

Lastly, “The Committee agreed that a ‘least regrets’ policy now implied that the significant level of monetary support in place since mid-2020 could be reduced sooner, so as to minimize the risk of not meeting its mandate.”

personalfinance,Student loans the smart way?,"Well before I take this next round of student loans I thought I’d get an opinion on if this is the smart way to do it. 

For school I take out federal subsidized loans, so that I’m not paying any interest on them right now. Mainly so I can have an added credit account history. For example: 

Loan A: 1,750-0% interest while in school. Stays in bank account until needed. 

Loan B- $3,500-0% interest while in school. 

Loan B pays off loan A, remainder goes to loan B, with a remainder of $1,750 that is still in the checking account. 

So my thought as stated was to pay them off after each semester, and always keep one open. 
Or would it be a better idea to just keep the money aside in a general checking account to automatically pay off every single one 5 months after graduation to have accounts that are a few years old? 

Student loan A- $1,750- 2.750 APR STARTING on 4/03/2025 0% interest until then. 

Student loan B-$3,500- Same as above 
Student loan C- $7,000- Same as above 
Student loan D- $13,000- Same as above. 

100k annually after over time and per diem (base pay is about 50k) 
Credit card A- $250 limit- 24.99% 
Credit Card B- $2500 limit-24.99% 
Credit card C- $6,000 limit 24.99%

Credit cards have a maintained balance of 2-5% each with minimum monthly payments. Of 30–30-65

Student loans are kept in a separate checking account with $25,000 in it currently. 
Main checking account has 8k, with an emergency fund of 25k. 

DTI-5k monthly rounded up(metropolitan area, higher COL) 
Rest of income is put into a retirement account sponsored by local union.

personalfinance,Big dummy (me) hasn't filed taxes in years,"Hey everyone, as the title explains, I am a big dummy who hasnt filed taxes in years.

I skimmed the wiki but didn't see an answer to my question: how do I file between 2015 to current?

1) I had a few different employers each year
2) I have some w2s, but not all, and as a result I 
3) grabbed the bull by the horns and called the IRS.
4) I am married filing separate, she claimed the kids
5) I would *like* to itemize my tools I have purchased for work and can acquire 90% of the supporting paperwork, but it isn't a requirement.
6) beyond points 1-5, there are no other credits or deductions I am aware of that apply to me, so likely simple filing
7) I went through the motions on h&amp;r a few years ago, and before I filed it told me I owed something like $670 to federal, so I didn't follow through. I *did*, however, add $20 of extra withholding to my tax sheet that I give my employer.
8) in an attempt to file previous years taxes online I went to efile dot com and it has calculated my 2020 federal return as high-ish for my filing status and income/deductions (in my opinion, a few thousand is high) and I owed just under $1000 in state. It would not allow me to file 2019 or earlier.


I'm sorry if I provided too much information or not enough, I am clueless when it comes to actually filing taxes, let alone 5 returns in one go.

So, experts, is the best (most cost effective way for short sweet and to just get it over with) way to file just to file 5 form 1040s?

personalfinance,Which debt to pay off first - not just a math problem?,"I am trying to figure out which debt to pay off first: my private student loan or my auto loan. Currently, my student loan balance is $11,000 and has a 3.1% variable interest rate. My auto loan has a balance of $9,000 but has a fixed rate of 3.76%. I have enough in my savings right now (not emergency fund) to use to pay off one (but not both) of these debts. The student loan is not federally backed so I'm currently paying on it each month.

I'm familiar with the debt avalanche method which basically would have me pay off the auto loan first to minimize the amount of interest that I pay. However, I'm worried that I will pay off the auto loan first and then my interest rate on my student loan will skyrocket. I'm also undergoing a major medical event later this year, and if I die or become permanently disabled, I heard it's easier to discharge an auto loan than a student loan. This makes me think I should pay off my student loan first. 

Is this a simple math question and I should just pay off my auto loan, future worries (rates and medical stuff) be darned? Or is paying off my student loan a better idea?",finance
personalfinance,Where to find the best lending company for a refinance?,"Hello Reddit!

I have an investment property and was wondering if I could get some recommendations on good lending companies for a refi? Interest rates are pretty low and my current mortgage is 4.125%.

personalfinance,Should I refinance my primary home mortgage?,"Please let me know if I should refinance my primary home.  TIA!

I have about 140K remaining in mortgage with 11 years left out of 15 year fixed mortgage at 3.375%.  I have the option to:

1. Pay it off in cash
2. Keep existing loan at 3.375% for 11 more years.
3. Refinance to 15 years at 2.22% fixed rate
4. Refinance to 30 years at 2.88% fixed rate

Which option is the smartest?  I'm going to make the following educated assumptions:

1. If I decide to not pay it off, I'll keep the money in a index fund.
2. Index fund returns 9% yoy on average across 15 year time span
3. Inflation rate is 2% annually
4. I'm going to assume the invested money appreciates at 3.625% (Index fund return - inflation rate - mortgage interest rate).  This is an approximation.
   1. But to calculate the difference between old and new loan terms I'm going to assume the compound interest rate is old rate - new rate.
5. I'm going to assume the closing cost is negligible.  Assume $0 to simplify math.
6. Tax deduction on existing mortgage is about $1500 on mortgage interest.  (E.g 33% tax bracket against $5000 annual interest when filing itemized deduction)

Let me know if the math makes sense for each scenario:

**If I pay it off in cash today:**

* I end up with no loss or gain (baseline)

**If I keep my existing mortgage at 3.375% fixed:**

* I end up with $57,000 in additional money relative to baseline at end of 15 year loan term.
* I should end up with $207,000 in additional money after 30 years assuming I invest the 57K in index fund for another 15 years.

**If I refinance to 15 years at 2.22% fixed:**

* I should end up with about $84,000 in additional money at end of 15 year loan term relative to baseline
* I should end up with about $305,000 in additional money after 30 years assuming I invest the 84k in index fund for another 15 years.

**If I refinance to 30 years at 2.88% fixed:**

* No idea how to calculate this correctly but I think I end up with around $205,000 in additional money at end of 30 year loan term.

It seems like refinancing at 15 years fixed at 2.22% makes the most sense as long as the assumptions hold.  Does this seem right?  To figure out how much I'd end up with I used the compound interest calculator with monthly contribution set to a negative value to emulate deduction (mortgage payment).",finance

4. Professor Aggelos Kiayias recently dropped a video explaining exactly how Mithril (apparently neckbeard dungeon master talk for elf armor) is going to allow for Perfect Cardano (ADA) wallets that combine the ease of use and convenience of light wallets with the trustlessness of full node wallets. We also learned exactly how Mithril is going to work. [https://youtu.be/LhepJFCyWRk](https://youtu.be/LhepJFCyWRk)
5. In proof-of-work, bootstrapping can be done with blockheaders. This won’t do in proof-of-stake since we need information about stakeholder distribution to confirm block validity.
6. Mithril fixes this by being a cryptographic construction that enables a population of stakeholders to issue a signature consistent with certain constraints.
7. For Mithril to work in proof-of-stake, it needs three crucial properties: 1) it needs to enforce a threshold ratio of stakeholders before the signature is issued; 2) the pre-signature fragments must be independently verified and subject to public aggregation; and 3) it must be efficient in the sense that the final signature is of constant size and is logarithmically dependent on the # of stakeholders.
8. Stakeholders will issue special Mithril keys along with the normal cryptographic key material. Then at regular intervals, full nodes will test whether they can produce a pre-signature fragment. Only a random subset of stakeholders will be eligible to produce a pre-signature fragment. When a sufficient # of pre-signature fragments have been issued by eligible stakeholders then it will be possible to aggregate the fragments into a final signature.
9. This will be a checkpoint that will be verifiable with respect to previous check points all the way back to the genesis block. Such checkpoints will be cryptographic commitments of the relevant UTXOs.
10. Since the checkpoints will be trustless, a light client (i.e. wallet) will only need to verify the sequence of checkpoints up to the current time to trustlessly bootstrap.

45. The bank of England is getting very serious about how it “may wish to limit migration” of money from the legacy system to stablecoins. Wow. Just another example of why it’s such an asset (no pun intended) that Cardano is prepared for regulation.

49. It’s a good sign that the top two crypto communities are spending so much time talking negatively about Cardano. You only focus your hatred on that which is most threatening. I’m glad to see we’re the biggest threat on their radar. [https://twitter.com/nic\_\_carter/status/1405194146063736840](https://twitter.com/nic__carter/status/1405194146063736840)
50. Bloomberg just published a piece called “America Should Become a Nation of Renters”. While this statement is probably extremely polarizing for Americans, it can also be argued that the death of homes as the primary investment vehicle of Americans may open up a new wave of adoption in crypto as an alternative.

52. All 345,501 of the people who have watched the Lex Fridman/Charles episode as of writing are realizing that Cardano could be the first project to put voting on the blockchain in a U.S. state. [https://www.atalaprism.io/app](https://www.atalaprism.io/app)
53. Days like today in Cardano and the greater crypto space always reminds me that there have been other great adoption stories that went through periods like this.[https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1407077949774442499](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1407077949774442499)
54. It looks like the second biggest ETH stakepool or it's custody provider has lost it’s users private keys to $75MM in ETH. Cardano doesn’t have this problem. We get to keep custody of our crypto because we found a better way than slashing. [https://stakehound.com/blog-post/fireblocks-eth-2-key-management-incident/](https://stakehound.com/blog-post/fireblocks-eth-2-key-management-incident/) [https://twitter.com/JamesSpediacci/status/1407465311180255236](https://twitter.com/JamesSpediacci/status/1407465311180255236)

57. The June Cardano 360 is currently available on Youtube. [https://youtu.be/al5m14299ww](https://youtu.be/al5m14299ww)
58. We saw segments on various newer partner entities like Nervos, Orion Protocol, and Revuto. Nervos is a UTXO proof-of-work blockchain which is building a cross-chain bridge with Cardano so that you can use your ADA on Nervos dApps and vice versa. Interoperability is a big theme for Nervos and they plan to have a working testnet within a month. Orion Protocol is building a terminal that will allow for decentralized non-custodial trading across centralized and decentralized exchanges. They say this would not require you to KYC or even have an account with any of these exchanges. Revuto is an online subscription management service that recently completed a $10MM token sale on Cardano.
59. It was also revealed that Wolfram Labs, COTI, and IOHK have a three-way partnership (a ménage à tech) to build an NFT auction site. The people from Wolfram were talking about very interesting things including live minting during streaming events and automated upload to IPFS. COTI will be building out auction and bidding mechanisms in ADAPay.
60. Professor Aggelos Kiayias gave us an update on research including that Ouroboros Chronos and Hydra papers have both been accepted into conferences/journals. Chronos will provide Cardano with a global concept of time that doesn’t rely on any outside timekeeper. Prof. Kiayias also pointed out that Hydra is distinguishable from other layer two protocols in that the scripting language is identical to that of the base layer in Cardano such that any dApp that can run on Cardano will run on the Hydra L2. This is a huge plus and superior to many other layer two solutions in other ecosystems where the base layer dApps will not run on layer two. Finally, the Mithril paper has been submitted for peer review. It will provide Cardano light wallets with Succinct Non-interactive Arguments of Knowledge that will give us the best of both worlds: no delays for syncing as in full node wallets while still preserving trustlessness.
61. Finally, the Goguen Summit will be in late September. Sign up now at [summit.cardano.org](http://summit.cardano.org/).
62. The Fed is once again STRONGLY signalling to us that they are going to regulate stablecoins. The Fed is also specifically calling out Tether for the first time. You need to be thinking about how stablecoin regulation might affect your favorite Cardano DeFi or other project. [https://twitter.com/CaitlinLong\_/status/1408500265397985282](https://twitter.com/CaitlinLong_/status/1408500265397985282) [https://twitter.com/CaitlinLong\_/status/1408572624125534212](https://twitter.com/CaitlinLong_/status/1408572624125534212)
63. People are starting to realize that the Stakehound private key loss in ETH may attract unwanted regulatory attention to Ethereum 2.0 while this problem could never have occurred in Cardano. Also, only a few days later another ETH stakepool (this time SharedStake...the sixth biggest ETH Stakepool) allegedly experiences a rugpull that some are valuing at over $30MM. This is another problem that could not happen in Cardano staking. It feels like we stepped into the ring, they rang the bell, and ETH just started punching itself in the head. Eventually it’s going to KO itself.

65. John O’Connor of IOHK points out that France still controls the monetary policy of 14 countries in Africa. There is definitely a built in market on the continent for a project that delivers monetary sovereignty to the people.

76. Cardano is now a small part of Grayscale’s Digital Large Cap Fund. They actually sold off current holdings in other coins to buy ADA. This is big for institutional adoption! [https://twitter.com/Grayscale/status/1410945118228692994](https://twitter.com/Grayscale/status/1410945118228692994)

79. Robert Kornacki of dcSpark releases an article on why every Cardano dApp will use NFTs. The article contains some very interesting discussion on smart contracts in the EUTXO context including language instructing that “UTXOs have smart contracts attached to them and not the other way around” and “\[...\]the simplest way to think about it is that when a UTXO is created it has the option to have a smart contract attached to it.” [https://medium.com/dcspark/every-eutxo-dapp-will-use-nfts-and-heres-why-fd87e6a8c9a6](https://medium.com/dcspark/every-eutxo-dapp-will-use-nfts-and-heres-why-fd87e6a8c9a6)

100. Very interesting timing with a) Grayscale Buying $50MM ETCG, b) Grayscale adding ADA, and c) Charles joining the ETC Cooperative board given that two of the members of the ETC Cooperative board seem to come from Grayscale and DCG.

108. In news that could have significant repercussions for many stablecoin reliant Cardano DeFi projects, Fed Chair Jerome Powell gave some hard signals that they will regulate stablecoins in House Committee testimony.  He revealed that the Fed will issue its long-awated paper on stablecoins, CBDCs, and other digital assets in September.  Powell also went as far as to say ""You wouldn't need stable coins you wouldn't need cryptocurrencies if you had a digital US currency, I think that's one of the stronger arguments in its favor.""

stocks,"7/16/2021 Some Trade Ideas, also some logic behind the Index and first week of earnings which have been very strong, will wait for next week","Good morning everyone, I am writing this at 5:45 AM, so I am not able to get all the news I normally get by 8AM. I still am going to be cautious as I have been all week. The earnings that have come out so far have been very good. It is unfortunate that the indexes have made new highs but this was without a broad market rally. There are about 12-13,000 tickers that trade on US Markets. Nasdaq near 5,000 NYSE near 4,000. However, many are still asking me what do I feel is going on... Unfortunately, the largest 25 stocks on the Nasdaq are near 52 week highs and carrying the index. The market breadth has been horrible. That is measured by the amount of advancers/decliners \[Green/Blue\] Since Fed Chairman has spoke, even on days we are in the green on the Nasdaq, making new highs, there are alot more decliners than advancers. Sometimes more than 3 to 1. I have wrote posts on how 5 stocks are close to 40% of the Nasdaq. \[AAPL, AMZN, MSFT, GOOG, FB\] So this is the divergence. That most worrisome factor for me is if these power houses go down and the Nasdaq comes down to 14,000 does it cause a widespread panic. The new all time high on the Nasdaq is near 14,800 so a correction now is about 13,300.

The earnings have been coming have been a huge beat, as much as last quarter which was the 3rd best since tracking of the SP500. It has been mostly banks and some others as well. It is extremely odd, because banks going into earnings have not rallied much, are making more money than ever, sales are high, these banks have the power to buy shares as well as raise dividends, but these banks are not taking off. The report by GS which by the way had the best earnings report last quarter, was even as good this quarter! Yes, GS did rally into earnings but after that report should still have been rewarded. Why? The company has the power to make 50+ dollars per share, trades around 380, and is still beating. As said earlier these banks/finance have cash to buyback, dividend or special dividend. Remember, the reason people ever get into the stock market in the first place is to earn money from a company that is going to share in the profits. Is SE, SNOW, LMND ever going to be able to do that? So why are they given an insane valuation is wordly. GS could pay everyone 25 dollars a share if they wanted and be fine! They currently pay $8! This is why we were supposed to invest from the start. If I was on the board, I would explore some different strategies to shoot up my stock, because at the end of the day the CEO's number #1 goal is to raise share price.

When a share price is high you can use your share price as currency to buy another company. When your share price is high you can sell it as an employee. The share price is high you can get talent by telling new highers they get a bonus with shares that will vest over time. When your company makes money, they can buy shares and issue them to employees and they can start this whole circle again.... so once again nothing is more important then a high share price. This is how GOOG, AAPL, MSFT, AMAZN, FB have got talent, made acquisitions, using the shares as currency! In 2021 there have been more offerings than ever, especially with companies with horrible financials to raise cash, because once again, high share price. The importance of this is because these banks and financials, have a way to increase share price because their businesses bring cash! These are the companies that should be rewarded for + cash flows and amazing earnings. It does stump me how a CRWD, NIO, TSLA, TWLO are insanely high.

Yesterday, I was trading ZIM, NYCB and NYMT. I will continue to do today. I also did trade TIGR who had 250% sales growth and was profitable. Honestly, I was shocked that GS would give TIGR a sell rating and a $21 target. How do they arrive at this number? I would absolutely love to know.

I may otherwise stay on the sidelines as I will have a busy day. Good luck everyone.",finance

CryptoCurrency,➡️ Analysis of DEX Inflation Via Yield Farming Vs. Token Price | Econteric.com,"# General Conclusion

Inflation is not only an important variable in monetary policy in the economy, but also important in crypto. Inflation is the easiest way to fund development. This forces holders to indirectly pay for development through the loss of value or ownership of the token over time to the protocol.

Inflation is usually referred to via a token release schedule; the researcher actively recalculates it.

# What Is Inflation?

&gt;Inflation in traditional economics refers to the **increase in prices of goods.** Inflation in token economics refers to the **increase in token supply.**

Inflation is the persistent increase in the general price level of goods and services over time and the value loss of a currency. When the general price level rises, **a unit of currency buys fewer goods and services than in the past.** Thus, inflation reflects a decrease in purchasing power per unit of a currency. In the economy, inflation is affected by many factors such as **demand-pull, cost-push, structural changes and import and export, etc.**

In the crypto space, inflation is the issuing of new crypto/tokens into circulation which puts selling pressure on them. In theory, their value should decrease with an increase in supply, if demand is constant. Inflation in the crypto space is mainly affected by **the increase in the supply of circulating tokens**.

# Token Issuance Model

The only impact on inflation is the issuance of tokens into circulation. Token inflation is used to bootstrap growth or to start a community. In this section we are going to find the answer to this question: which issuance models have been used so far in crypto space?

defi,Discussion: Taking advantage of upcoming changes to Ethereum,"Likely a better post for r/cc but I find the discussion is much better in this sub.  Yesterday we talked about ETH gas costs and if it was worth farming or staking on Mainnet due to transaction costs.  I thought it was a great discussion.  Based on that and another thread I saw today regarding lowering ETH gas costs, I thought I might start another discussion.

**Topic:  How can we take advantage of upcoming changes to the Ethereum Mainnet (London fork) and the 2022 move to PoS to get ahead of coin price moves, changes to DeFi and get ahead of the crowd**

* London fork will make gas costs more predictable and possibly create a marginally lower cost of transacting on the Mainnet
* In 2022 (we hope) change to PoS should put an end to mining and dramatically reduce gas costs and improve stability/speed/costs to transact on ETH mainnet
* Please add what else is in the pipeline

**I am referring not just to liquidity mining and/or staking, but more broadly who will be the winners of the upcoming 12-24 months in the CC and Defi markets.  My initial thoughts:**

* TVL on ETH mainnet will explode higher
* While the upcoming changes might be priced into ETH, there will still be buying pressure from those who are totally new to the Defi space
* Increased liquidity and volume on DEXs
* Increased TVL and deposits means lower interest rates and returns
* Likely much more scrutiny from the IRS
* What coins, platforms, projects will benefit from the above
* What will happen to Layer 2 solutions (btw what is happening to MATIC price recently?  Is it an expectation Defi'ers will move to mainnet?)

personalfinance,Potential effect of refinancing private student loans on future home purchase.,"To start I know that there are a lot of unknowns here and I am not expecting a perfect answer, I just want to see if I've missed anything that could potentially hurt myself down the line before I pull the trigger on refinancing.

**Bio**

* 26 married.
* Living in a low COL area.
* 730 credit score.

**Income**

I make 66k + profit sharing. My wife makes $13k but is on track to make anywhere from $40k-$60k within the next year or two.

**Liabilities**

I have 102k spread across 7 variable rate private student loans. Currently I have combinded an interest rate somwhere in the high 2% low 3% range.

I currently put $1,666.66/month into these loans as my dad is pitching in $500 for now. For us this is manageable and we still live a very comfortable lifestyle.

**Assets**

* 50k in various stock portfolios (fun money, roth IRA, 401k, mutual fund).
* I plan to use the 18k in my 'fun money' account for a down payment on a house.

**The situation**

My credit score is 730 thanks in large part to the collective age of my student loans and my consistent on-time payments. Aside from those loans I have an Apple card that was only opened 2 years ago. We want to look into buying a house within a year or two (specifically when the market cools off from the pandemic insanity) but I'm  well aware of the rapid inflation we've seen recently. I'm concerned that we will see interest rates go up in the near future and my private student loans will see a pretty big jump in interest rates by then.

I know that the average age of my credit right now is just barely ""eh"" at 3 years 10 months. If I reconsolidate those 7 loans into a single one with SoFi (I prequalified for a fixed 4.373% interest rate) my average age of credit will drop to 1 year, 8 months. I can't seem to find a straight answer on whether or not I should just keep what I have and just weather the higher interest rates in order to preserve my good credit score, or if I should instead reconsolidate to protect myself from what appears to be all but inevitable interest rate hikes.

Another question I had was if I would benefit from having sofi reconsolidate all but, say, 200 dollars in each of those 7 accounts and just pay the minimums on them for the next 10 years. In my mind this seems like a way to keep the average age of my accounts high while still benefiting from the advantages of locking into a fixed interest rate loan in case inflation hits.

Thanks in advance for the help. If I've missed anything feel free to ask, I'm using a throwaway so I can be an open book on my finances.",finance

personalfinance,Ga homeowner thinking about refinance (better lending),"So I logged in to credit karma. The other day to see what kind of credit cards I can get to further build my credit. Then all of a sudden it shows me an ad for better lending. I have never heard of them. But I proceed out of curiosity. I am to the point now where I can lock in a 15 yr mortgage with 1.825 interest rate with a 1,060 monthly payment. 

This is a two part question. How do you guys feel about that rate? Is that pretty good?if I wait will I never see rates like this again? Is better lending even a good company? Is there better lenders I could do this through? 

My instinct is to go through with it but I want to research everything about this before I follow through. On credit karma the lender is highly reviewed. But looking at Yelp. It’s a lot of bad reviews. I’m not sure if I should do this or not. I’m hoping to be enlightened by more knowledgeable people. Thank you guys!

This is the text I received earlier 

Could you confirm - you would like to lock the 15 year 1.875% with $3,062 in points, correct?

https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/ojfz13/stablecoins_from_the_perspective_of_a_3rd_world/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share


My idea is the following: if the FED issues a stablecoin tied to the value of the dollar (1 USD = 1 FED stablecoin, fully backed). What would the results be?

Pros:

A.USDT bomb would explode, as well as other stablecoins. Why use unbacked tether when you can use this fully backed coin?

B.Transparency: all transactions would be stored in the blockchain so black markets would be difficult if we eliminate physical currencies

C.Low fees and transaction costs: this applies mainly to countries were having dollars is not allowed. We would be able to transfer significant amounts of money for low/non-existent fees.

Cons: 

A.Those that want to avoid goverment control would be unable to do it.

B.The FED gains the ability to use emisions of stablecoins to do QE (quantitative easing) to crypto prices. Maybe a possible stabilization policy in the prices of crypto?

Final thought: isn't it the centralization that we want to avoid?

*(It said this link has already been used in the past 30 days, but couldn’t find it. Not sure.)*

Today I read this article and I found it very interesting! Perhaps because it is coming from an economist. \*(Not familiar with the author tho)\*Especially during these times, crypto’s losing high % of their value of only a couple of months ago. Big news of Mark Cuban “lashing” out about policies towards crypto and so on. Definitely not a crypto pro, but I’ve been learning so much lately.

I was curious about some feedback from you on this article. Rather your new to crypto or not, perhaps you may even be against crypto’s. I want to know. 🙂 (I’m pretty new myself, learning day more as go)

Personally, I found it a good article, and the reason for this is that a lot of people really DO NOT understand the economics of the world. People like to say money makes the world go around, but I always ask myself what do they really **understand** about money?! 🤔 Because really IMO if you know what money is and how it works you’ll believe in crypto.

I wanted to cite a couple of things and go a bit more in dept about how I perceive these. If you want the full read, you can do that via the link above.

Let's start with the title.

**“What the Crypto Crowd Doesn’t Understand About Economics”**  
We know the media use copywriting to their advantage, but when I read this title I totally felt adrenaline rushing. I expected totally something else from this article. Thought it would be giving a ton of stats why crypto’s fans are failing to considering when it comes to crypto. And why people are losing money and a ton of talk about inflation, simply put negativity. But I have to say I was surprised in a good way. Which is why I wanted to share this, because even tho you may own crypto’s understanding the economics of it or of the world is important. And this article helps to clarify this from a very journalistic prospect, and not being negative but pointing the obvious out.

**“Just last week I** [**argued**](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-06-09/crypto-finally-has-a-reason-to-exist-decentralized-finance) **that cryptocurrency is here to stay.”**  
I know I’m not the only one with this issue, lol. It is hard sometimes how to explain to people why crypto can not just vanish. Or even be banned altogether, IMO.

But it is definitely important to have this discussion with other “skeptical” because if you know why you’re investing in it, you then need to open other people’s mind towards crypto’s. And if you’re in it to just get rich quick than you may be selling low instead of buying the dip. It does make you a crypto ‘investor/owner’ but do you understand what you’re doing?! Also having the opportunity to create freedom for your family and friends is amazing, don’t be greedy. 😝  Beside, the whole eco-system that comes with crypto is just amazing.

**“Many of you do not understand monetary economics very well.”**  
You see this panic all the time when the FED talks or when an article comes out shaming crypto, or for example when china “banned” it. This is not to say don’t worry about the news, but more so to understand **what** the news means **for** the market and what you **can** do to stay **ahead** and or **take advantage** of it.

\*Would you be less worried getting into an accident driving a car with or without airbags?\*  
You know what airbags do, and that is why you want a car with airbags. The simple reason because you understand the basic/use of an airbag, in other words the fundamentals of it. And that gives you the reassurance of owning a car with airbag instead of without.

This is the same when it comes to cryptocurrencies, understand monetary policy and know that crypto is here to stay.

**“First, the dollar is not on the verge of collapse, nor will it be replaced by a crypto asset.”**  
I will definitely agree with the first part. I don’t believe the dollar will collapse. To explain this may take a while, but one simple thing is looking at inflation of 50 and 75 years ago. Nothing compare to today, as a matter effect we dipped lower than we have been ever since recording inflation. Plus there is a ton more dollar floating around than before which scares a lot of people, but I believe is exactly the reason why rates are so low. It is not because of a lot of it, but more of how it is moving around.

It's only to create panic (scare tactic) in people as result panic in the market. People calling their hedge funds and saying pull my money out. And again if you understand the fundamentals you will read between the lines, make a plan and execute.

The second part, I struggle with a bit. Because I don’t think that the dollar will be “replaced”, but I do believe that we will sure but slowly make a transition from cash to digital money *(which is already happening, look at Europe and China)*. I mean, Europe is pretty much digital already, ATM’s are being removed because of it. People barely carry cash with them and after 2020 people even more afraid to have to do that exchange now. And let's not even talk about China. 😅 Now we can keep a digital fiat without transitioning to crypto fiat or no fiat but pure crypto coin? That's a question I don’t have an answer for yet for myself, perhaps because I won’t experience it all?!

**“If anything, crypto is more likely to hurt the currencies of countries that are doing very poorly,** [**such as Venezuela**](https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-adoption-venezuela-research)**""**  
Fiat currency won’t just go away, so over the long run crypto could actually boost the value of the dollar by stifling the rise of potential competitors.”\*\*Here I feel like he contradicts himself, by saying it will hurt countries that are doing poorly and then say that fiat currency won’t just go away.

IMO, countries that are doing poorly can definitely benefit of crypto’s. Now this has 2 sides to it because this will only be achievable if there is $ or € to buy these cryptos. And looking at a country like Venezuela, they have $ coming in but when buying you won’t get back dollars, instead you get Bolivars which are pretty much worthless. As a result, you are now “broke”.

But if the country would transition fully into crypto, this can boost their economy. (now of course banks will try to fight this, look at El Salvador, but it can definitely help the poor countries.) So the $ has become more like storing gold.

At the other hand, changing to crypto means “removing” from the $ (sort of). And this can have negative result for the $ but since $ is needed to buy the crypto the impact won’t be that much. The question is: will you go from cash fiat to a crypto fiat or adapt to an already existing crypto?!

**“A second point, oft neglected in the crypto community, is that crypto prices won’t continue to go up forever at high rates.”**  
People forget that crypto’s are not stock! There is no market cap, no revenue, no assets or liabilities to consider, all there is the usage and usefulness. As a result, it is worth what people are willing to pay for it, simple. All the volatility they talk about crypto right now in the future will change because of policies changing which gives crypto a better stronghold. The more people believe in it, the higher the price. But regulations can also stagger the price, and because regulations are still “none-present” people move in and out of crypto. (unless you’re a HODL)

But with better regulation, I believe the behaviour of crypto will change drastically.

**“And whatever the long-run value of crypto will be, markets have been getting it wrong.”**  
I wouldn’t say getting it wrong, but more like they haven't found a way to gain from the crypto’s, yet. Yes you pay taxes on it, but that is only if you sell, which means if you HODL that $ is not coming back to the banks and that doesn’t make the policymakers very happy. 😂But if banks and institutions start doing what for example BlockFi is doing where you can use your crypto as asset/collateral to loan, then this can benefit banks in the long run. It would be a smart move!

Sucks for them, good for us! 😄

**“All that said, normalization — of crypto theory as well as value — is on its way. It will be less fun than the radical and topsy-turvy crypto status quo. But it is nonetheless something to celebrate.”**  
This is something that I’m looking at for the future. It doesn’t scare me, but it is something that I do wonder about and try to plan for the worst. We will have more stability for crypto’s in the future. Even so that some will vanish for one reason or another. But that crypto is here to stay that is for sure, the question is how will you plan for all that there is to come?

If you made it this far, thanks! I appreciate you reading and would love to get your feedback on this. I think these types of talks need to happen more often, instead of all the negativity around this. I’ll be looking forward to your comments.

**TL;DR:** The author of the article clearly wants people to have a different view when it comes to crypto. Not just call it a gamble, waste money or useless. But look at our history as society and how our system, policies, fiats have been for the past years and base an opinion of that. And not be opposed to something just because its new (innovation). I enjoyed the article and hope we can have more like these!

Cheers! 😊✌🏽

personalfinance,Still haven't received 2019 federal tax refund. What happens if it was fraudulently cashed?,"I utilized the tax filing extension in 2019 and e-filed sometime in June. I received my state income refund a few weeks later, but I still haven't received my federal income refund. I figured that there would be delays, but I received my 2020 tax refund about 1 month after filing. By now... I think I've given enough time. Every time I try to call (been trying a few days every week for a month) I get an automated response saying that the lines are full. 

Is there anything else I can do besides calling the same number 18008291040)? I'm hoping that my check was lost, but what if it was cashed by someone else? Is there a time limit of when I can fight a fraudulent deposit? Is this outside the realm of reality?",finance

personalfinance,time of credit check for HELOC,"When do lenders (in this particular case, Third Federal) usually pull credit for a heloc application?

Bitcoincash,It’s clear why Jerome Powell wants to control digital payments and suppress competitors like USDT/ BCH,"Hearing him talk about the concerns of stable coins and of other digital currency is it clear what the Fed wants. this has an always will be about control, controlling peoples money, controlling where they spend their money controlling where that money goes they want more control with CBDC’s and that’s what they’re going to get. They want to know when and how we spend our money and not only that be able to stop us spending where we want to spend our money. This is why I feel now more than ever alternative forms of payment like bitcoin cash or US DC/T are very important for the future of cryptocurrency in the market as a whole. I do have a strong feeling that they will shut down tether as a means of payment which will temporarily cause liquidity within the market but it will rebound. We have had issues in the past with providing enough assets to back the amount of digital currency that is floating around which leads me to believe they will not let it continue. This is why I believe now more than ever it’s important for us as individuals to speak out against this further form of control and take our own money into our own power.

stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Friday, July 16, 2021","**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, July 16, 2021**

Volatility in the markets continued today, with the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) falling for the third consecutive day after recording new intraday highs earlier in the week. The Dow Jones (DIA) also fell while the Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, continued its streak of underperformance, pulling back more than 1% for the fourth consecutive day. Market participants continue to digest Q2 earning reports, mixed economic data regarding inflation, and commentary by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. 

Ever since the release of the June Consumer and Producer Price Indexes (CPI &amp; PPI), which showed price inflation growing at a higher than expected clip, the market has become increasingly volatile, which is not super surprising given the SPY and QQQ have been on a remarkable rally as of late. The CPI, which measures changes in the prices of consumer goods, rose 0.9% in June, accelerating from May’s 0.6%. Year-on-year, the CPI is up 5.4%, exceeding the 4.9% expected by economists and the fastest rate of growth since 2008. Core CPI, which excludes the volatile price energy and food and is therefore considered a more accurate representation of general price inflation, was up 4.5% year-on-year as prices bounced from last year’s pandemic-era lows. PPI, which measures the average changes in prices received by domestic producers for their output rose 1% in June, accelerating to a 7.3% rise year-on-year, while still reflecting base effects. Core PPI rose 5.5%. This is the fastest rate of increase since 2009.

On a positive note, according to a report by the Department of Commerce, retail sales in the US unexpectedly increased in June, despite massive supply-side constraints affecting a swath of consumer goods, most notably, vehicles. The report showed spending was increasingly shifting back to services, like travel and entertainment, an encouraging sign that the reopening of the economy is going fairly well. Retail sales rose 0.6% in June, better than the decline of 0.4% expected by economists. Retail sales in the US are up 18% from June 2020, reflecting base effects as the economy continues to rebound from the pandemic-induced recession. 

Mike Loewengart, Managing Director of Investment Strategy at E-Trade Financial said, “*""*The unexpected rise in retail sales combined with yesterday’s pandemic-era low of jobless claims are two more strong proof points that we are edging closer to a full economic recovery. While we are seeing consumers broadly look more towards services and activities, the expectations that people would be turning away from goods seems to have been a little overblown.""

Earlier this week, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell gave his semi-annual monetary policy testimony before Congress, where he largely reiterated the same thing he has been saying for months. Powell said “inflation will likely remain elevated in the coming months before moderating” and that the US economy was “still a ways” off from reaching the threshold of “substantial further progress” that would trigger the Central Bank to roll-back pandemic-era policies. In short, Powell basically said while he expects higher inflation prints in the coming months, pressures are transitory and due to pandemic era disruptions and the Fed’s goal for economic recovery have not been met. [Here is Powell’s complete testimony, but here are two of his most important quotes.](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/testimony/powell20210714a.htm)

**On the labor market:** “Conditions in the labor market have continued to improve, but there is still a long way to go. Labor demand appears to be very strong; job openings are at a record high, hiring is robust, and many workers are leaving their current jobs to search for better ones. Indeed, employers added 1.7 million workers from April through June. However, the unemployment rate remained elevated in June at 5.9 percent, and this figure understates the shortfall in employment, particularly as participation in the labor market has not moved up from the low rates that have prevailed for most of the past year. Job gains should be strong in coming months as public health conditions continue to improve and as some of the other pandemic-related factors currently weighing them down diminish.”

**On inflation:** “Inflation has increased notably and will likely remain elevated in coming months before moderating. Inflation is being temporarily boosted by base effects, as the sharp pandemic-related price declines from last spring drop out of the 12-month calculation. In addition, strong demand in sectors where production bottlenecks or other supply constraints have limited production has led to especially rapid price increases for some goods and services, which should partially reverse as the effects of the bottlenecks unwind. Prices for services that were hard hit by the pandemic have also jumped in recent months as demand for these services has surged with the reopening of the economy”.

**Highlights**

* Ford Motors (F) issued three safety recalls affecting more than 800,000 in response to six injury allegations stemming from issues with the “rear suspension toe link which significantly diminishes steering control, increasing the risk of a crash.”
* Twitter (TWTR) and Square (SQ) CEO Jack Dorsey said SQ is launching a business dedicated to “decentralized financial services”. Through Twitter Dorsey said the company is “focused on building an open developer platform with the sole goal of making it easy to create non-custodial, permissionless, and decentralized financial services.”
* Tesla (TSLA) vehicle registrations in California rose more than 85% in the second quarter versus last year, largely due to the success of the company's Model Y, according to data from research firm Cross-Sell
* Import prices were up 1% in June over May, adding to a 1.4% increase the month prior. This marks the eighth straight month import prices have risen and brings the annual price increase to 11.2%
* Netflix (NFLX) has announced it plans to eventually stream video games on its platform and hired a former Electronic Arts (EA) executive to lead the push. 
* As earnings season continues, big bank stocks continue falling despite, in most cases, posting great earnings. 
* Microsoft (MSFT) is betting hybrid work will provide an opening to make its Windows operating system more widespread, launching a new service aimed at getting users of Apple (AAPL) and Android products to use the software. Windows 365, the company said, will be accessible on any device running any operating system that has a web browser, such as Apple Mac computers, iPhones and iPads, or those running Android software made by Alphabet (GOOGL)

Bitcoin,GOLD CUP SHITPOST: El Salvador v Mexico,"Hello friends and fellow HODLers.

So, lately, there's been a lot of enthusiasm around here for El Salvador, first sovereign nation to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender currency. I think we should extend our support to El Salvador in their upcoming soccer match against Mexico, in the Gold Cup!

1. About the Gold Cup

What is it? It's a soccer tournament. In soccer, there is a World governing body called FIFA which oversees the rules of the game and the organization of the World Cup (and other, smaller tournaments). National Federations of soccer clubs are, of course, members of FIFA. But other important members of FIFA are regional confederations. You've probably heard of UEFA or Conmebol. UEFA organizes the Champion's League between the top clubs in Europe and the EuroCup (recently won by Italy), while Conmebol organizes the Libertadores Cup (between the top clubs in South America) and the Copa America (recently won by Argentina). Similarly, the area of North America, Central America, and the Caribbean has its own Confederation called CONCACAF. CONCACAF organizes the region's equivalent to the EuroCup or the Copa America. It's called the ""Gold Cup"", and for commercial reasons, it's always held in the United States. This is the biggest international tournament held in America that most Americans have probably never heard of.

Usually, either Mexico or the United States wins the Gold Cup, as they are the countries with the most developed soccer infrastructure in the region. However, soccer is extremely popular in other countries in Central America, too, like Costa Rica, Honduras, and, of course, El Salvador. In fact, [in 1969, Honduras and El Salvador went to war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_War) (literal military conflict) over a soccer match! And there's no team that Central American countries compete hardest against than Mexico, who frequently called themselves 'the giant of CONCACAF', often undeservedly, and who belittles their national team and leagues. Mexico is the team to beat.

2. About the match

So, my proposal is to cheer for El Salvador as a proxy to cheering for Bitcoin. But also, let's cheer against Mexico. Why? Here are a few reasons:

a) They suck ass. They always belittle and abuse their neighbors to the south will playing victim at the treatment they get from their northern neighbor. You've heard of the migrant crisis? Those migrants are not Mexican but Central American, many of them Hondurans and Salvadorans, and where do you think they get the most abuse? Not in ICE detention, but in Mexico's INM, not to mention, of course, the Mexican cartels...  

On top of that, Mexico has a long history of infringing on FIFA rules against discrimination by having the crowd yell an homophobic chant. They have done this every match, and continue to accrue penalties. FIFA has threatened them with barring them from the World Cup if the behavior continues, and since Mexico are sore-losers, the behavior will continue if they continue to lose.

b) Mexico is anti-bitcoin. Yes, you've heard of Salinas Pliego, the Mexican billionaire that has invested 10% of this liquid assets to bitcoin. Well, he tried to integrate bitcoin payments and bitcoin accounts into his bank, ""Banco Azteca"", and was quickly rebuffed by Mexico's banking authorities and the Central Bank, Banxico. Mexico's government's official position is that bitcoin is a ""speculative digital asset"" that has no place in the retail financial sector. 

And have you heard of Agustín Carstens? Agustin Carstens is the current chair of the Bank of International Settlements (BIS), so called the central bank of central banks. He's the counterpart to the IMF's Christine Lagarde, coordinating with the central banksters from around the world in case they ever need a global bailout from their fixing of the their national economies. He's also Mexican, formerly head of Banxico, and prior to that, head of Mexico's Finance Ministry. He set the policies that today put Mexico against bitcoin. 

3. The match. Mexico is the obvious favorite to win. But we like underdogs here, right? El Salvador, against all odds, currently leads the group. Mexico needs a win to secure passage to the next round, but El Salvador qualifies with a tie. Mexico's stars Hirving 'El Chucky' Lozano and Raul Jimenez are injured, so El Salvador has a real chance here. The game is on Sunday night. Tune in!

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: The Gold Cup is the equivalent to the EuroCup, but for North America, Central America, and the Caribbean. Usually, the finalists are USA and Mexico, and Mexico has won most often. The tournament is held in the USA. This Sunday, El Salvador play Mexico. The winner will lead their group and secure a qualification to the next round. El Salvador only needs a tie to achieve this. Mexico is the favorite, but we like underdogs. El Salvador is the pro-bitcoin team. Mexico is the anti-bitcoin team, that is also obnoxious and homophobic. So, I invite everyone here to support bitcoin by proxy of supporting El Salvador, and tune in on Sunday!",cryptocurrency

cybersecurity,Critical Infrastructure (CI) Cybersecurity: Is CMMC the Answer?,"Within the defense community, the CMMC framework is sending a clear message to Defense Industrial Base (DIB) companies: If you want to do business with the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), you must prove that you can meet a series of cybersecurity standards that are deemed essential. Assessed against five maturity levels, the more best practices you meet, the more opportunities you can potentially bid on. However, if you can’t satisfy the most fundamental of these requirements, you’re out of the game.

Suffice it to say, there is much at stake. The DIB’s 100,000-plus systems integrators, tech service providers, and other suppliers represent $394 billion in annual awards.1 The sector, however, appears ripe for major compromises, as the number of newly reported common IT vulnerabilities for the DIB rose to 17,305 in 2020 from 14,645 in 2017. At least 37 DIB businesses, in addition to federal government agencies, were impacted by the 2020 SolarWinds breach.

In response to increasing cyber threat issues, the DoD has unveiled CMMC with the goal of safeguarding controlled unclassified information (CUI) — protected information or data created or possessed by the government or another entity on the government’s behalf — throughout its supply chain. Examples of CUI include technical data, personally identifiable information, and information marked For Official Use Only. 

Defense leaders are implementing the framework through a phased rollout approach from fiscal years 2021 through 2025. Under CMMC, contractors must undergo assessments to prove that they can sufficiently perform cybersecurity capabilities. These practices and processes fall within 17 domain categories, adapted from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication 800-171 and other sources. These domains include situational awareness, access control, risk management, incident response, recovery, and system and information integrity. DIB businesses are seeking to earn certifications across different maturity levels, starting at basic cyber hygiene and taking on more comprehensive and challenging requirements from there. As part of CMMC’s flow-down requirements, subcontractors are also subject to the assessment and certification process.

It remains to be seen how significantly CMMC, and its set of requirements, improves the defense community’s security posture. But if it proves successful during its initial rollout, then why wouldn’t the government, through its various agencies, leverage CMMC as a model for CI sectors as a whole, not just DoD suppliers?

After all, there were nearly 400 reported CI ransomware attacks in 2020, up from 207 in 2019. Among CI security professionals, 55% indicate that cybercriminals have increasingly targeted their organizations since the pandemic began. Within the global utilities sector, two-thirds of organizations say that sophisticated attacks are a top challenge, but just 31%, perhaps optimistically, rate their readiness to respond and contain a breach as high.

Today, there is no standard security certification framework for assessing CI. As a result, there is an uneven patchwork of compliance guidelines that a given organization may be measured against. For example, within the energy sector, NERC CIP, is applicable to all bulk power system owners and operators, while other CI sectors are not held to any defined standards. Establishing a common set of tiered requirements for all CI would greatly reduce complexity and ensure that larger swaths of infrastructure have appropriate security controls in place. Could CMMC be that standard?

Facing the impending CMMC rollout, many small businesses have complained that the associated security requirements are too onerous based on budget and size. Certainly, federal acquisition offices must develop a model to help smaller businesses that would otherwise struggle to comply (e.g., setting aside funding to help qualifying companies meet the standards).

But once these challenges are addressed, an across-the-board designation of CMMC as a requirement for all CI sectors could lead to two immediate and substantial benefits:

* **A ready-made set of standards.** CMMC isn’t an idea that’s still in the drawing board stages. It’s rolling out — now. There is no reason to start from scratch in developing new requirements for a CI-wide standard. Its requirements are readily transferable to CI sectors outside of the DIB, so regulators and procurement agencies should take full advantage of the work that has already been accomplished.
* **A single source of compliance**. Instead of forcing companies to jump through multiple cybersecurity compliance hoops to do business, they’d only have to focus on CMMC. If there are flaws within the framework, government and private industry leaders can fix a single standard as opposed to bringing on a new set of requirements to manage.

Ultimately, demonstrably elevating the cybersecurity posture of CI as a whole would emerge as the third — and most meaningful — benefit. If regulation is deemed too heavy-handed, it could begin by requiring it for all federal contractors, whether they handle CUI or potentially impact the availability of key services that the federal government relies on. While this would not immediately cover all CI members, it certainly would put a dent in the problem. CI members and their suppliers would have to improve the way they protect systems, respond to incidents, and manage risk. If not, they would lose business or a competitive advantage. By successfully complying with a refined CMMC, and handling the necessary blocking and tackling, they would be able to stay in the game while keeping critical infrastructure safely protected.

personalfinance,Cash out refinance to pay off car lease &amp; invest or keep everything the same?,"**Hi everyone, I am looking for input on whether I should keep my current mortgage and car lease in place or if I should do a cash out refinance and use the money to pay off my car and apply the rest of the money to long term investments. Any advice is appreciated!**

Things to note:

I max out my 401(k), with 10% going to traditional and 3% going to Roth.

I max out my Roth IRA contribution each year.

My wife's traditional IRA contribution is maxed out each year.

I contribute another 6% of my salary to a 409A non-qualified deferred compensation plan.

I cannot make after-tax 401(k) contributions and I have no access to an HSA at work :(

Even though we don't yet have kids, my wife and I plan to, so I contribute to a 529 plan in my state. I am currently the beneficiary and will change the designation when we have a child.

I am in my late 30s and my wife is in her early 30s. Income $150,000/yr. Total retirement account balances are over $300,000. Savings/emergency fund balance is $50,000 (my yearly expenses are approximately $48,000). Investment balances are over $30,000. Deferred compensation balance is over $30,000. 529 plan balance is $3,000. No other debt besides mortgage and car lease listed below.

&amp;#x200B;

**Current situation:**

Mortgage (30 year fixed) = Balance of $347,853 at 3.00% (loan began in August 2020 and I have paid down a little bit of extra in principal). Payment is $1,498.95/mo. w/o impounds

Car lease = 18 months of payments remaining at $679.94/mo. Then the original plan was to get a loan to buy out the car at the end of the lease. The loan would be for $23,330. Assuming a 4.00% interest rate, payments would be $424/mo. for 60 months.

&amp;#x200B;

**What I am considering:**

Cash out refinance of $100,000. That would put my new mortgage at $447,853. My home is worth at least $620,000 so I would still have over 27% equity. My new loan would be at an interest rate of 2.375% (2.566% APR). I would pay points to get to that rate. Total closing costs (points, title insurance, etc.) would be $13,294. I would receive a $2,000 American Express statement credit after the loan closes by refinancing with Better. That effectively drops the closing costs to $11,294. The new mortgage payment would be $1,740.59/mo.

I would net $86,706 at closing. The plan would be to use the money to:

1. Pay off car lease and purchase vehicle outright. Approximate cost $36,725.
2. Contribute $10,200 to my state's 529 plan for this year. I already contribute $150/mo. ($1,800/yr.) so this additional money would max out the state tax deduction of $12,000/yr. At my current AGI, this would save approximately $550 this year in state taxes.
3. Invest $20,000 in my brokerage account.
4. Complete some landscaping work at our house that my wife and I want to get done. Approximately $3,000.
5. Contribute $10,200 to my state's 529 plan in 2022. I already contribute $150/mo. ($1,800/yr.) so this additional money would max out the state tax deduction of $12,000/yr. At my current AGI, this would save approximately $550 next year in state taxes.

**Advantages:**

\*Get rid of car payment and reduce monthly costs. I would save $438/mo. for the next 18 months and then $256/mo. for the 5 years between January 2023-December 2027. In addition to the plan above (adding lump sums to 529 and brokerage accounts), I would direct these monthly savings to investments to grow for the long term.

\*Invest a large lump sum for my future child's education. There will be 18-20 years for this money to compound.

\* Save approximately $1,100 in state income taxes over the next 2 years.

\*Reduce interest rate on mortgage by .625%

\*Saves from having to pay a higher interest rate on a car loan (once the lease is done)

\*It makes sense mathematically to borrow money at less than 2.4% and invest it for the next 20-30 years. There is a very good chance of a 5-7% return. Positive carry for the win.

**Disadvantages:**

\*Adds another 14-16 months to my mortgage (current mortgage will be paid off around May 2050, new mortgage would end on August 2051)

\*Increases my total monthly outlay by $242 between January 2028-August 2051",finance
personalfinance,To buy a townhouse or keep renting an apartment?,"Hi everyone! 

I’m a single 30y F living in San Diego, CA, debating on whether to buy a townhouse or keep renting an apartment. I’ve never had my own place before so this will be a big decision. Any suggestions/ thoughts from you guys will be greatly appreciated!

My monthly income is ~$6,400 after tax withholding, health insurance, and 8% into my 401K. Additional annual bonus will be somewhere around $10K-$25K after tax and 8% into 401K.

My routine monthly spends are:
Car loan $575 (48 months to go)
Car insurance $100
Gas $60
Pet expenses $250
Utilities $120
Internet $60 (but my company reimburses me $50/month)
Food + entertainment $750

I’m looking for a townhouse that’s ~$625K, but let’s assuming it’s $650K since it’s very likely that I need to pay more to win the bid.

According to info on Redfin, here’s my monthly expenses for a $650K townhouse after paying 20% down payment:

$2100 P&amp;I (30-year fixed, interest rate 2.67%)
$568 property taxed (1.05% in SD it said)
$235 HOA
$119 home insurance 

So that brings my overall monthly expenses to ~$4,900.

I’ve saved enough for the 20% down payment and I have an additional $50K+ saved for any urgent or home improvement/ repair expenses. 

From my personal viewpoint-

Renting an apartment allows me to spend ~$2300/monthly rent (2B2B) to live in a really decent area- 10-15 minutes of driving to beach/shopping mall/supermarkets, always no traffic. A nice gym as part of the apartment amenities. Most importantly, same-day maintenance offered by my apartment complex at no additional cost on me. 
- drawback: 
   (1) no independent garage, no enough privacy cuz it’s an apartment after all. 
   (2) Also, no enough freedom for home improvement works. 

Buying a townhouse (2B1.5B to 3B2B with that budget) allows me to have my own place (and a small backyard!), private garage, and it can become an investment if I decided to move to other place after 3-5 years.
- drawback: 
   (1) location will be just an okay area (safety wise), farther away (20-25 minutes driving without traffic) to major places that I routinely go to. 
   (2) Probably no gym so that’ll lead to ~$40 monthly fitness expenses. 
   (3) Long turnaround time waiting for maintenance as well as the high cost can be huge headache as I’m absolutely not a hands-on type of person who would fix things by my own. 
   (4) Also, I’ll have to routinely spend $700+ more on housing expenses per month. 

Note: Maintenance concerns me the most, return of investment is the second concern, followed by the convenience of getting to everywhere.",finance

# **Earnings could be the biggest driver for markets in the week ahead as investors watch bonds - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/16/earnings-could-be-the-biggest-driver-for-markets-in-the-week-ahead-as-investors-watch-bonds.html)**
*****
&gt; Stocks enter a busy week for earnings news with two perplexing questions hanging over the market.
*****
&gt; One is whether the big gains in corporate profits will start to boost stocks with solid earnings reports. That was not the case for some financial sector stocks this past week. The other question is whether the surprise decline in the 10-year Treasury note yield is sending a message that stock investors should heed.
*****
&gt; The benchmark 10-year yield, which moves opposite price, was at 1.30% Friday, after dipping below that level on Thursday. Stock indexes slipped for the week, with the S&amp;P 500 down nearly 1% and the Dow down about 0.5% for the week. The Nasdaq, which has typically benefited from lower yields, was off by more than 1.9% for the week.
*****
&gt; Stocks had a rocky day Friday, selling off into the closing bell. Defensive sectors, like health care, consumer staples and utilities gained in the session, while cyclicals, like energy and materials were hit hard.
*****
&gt; Airlines, railroads, drug companies and tech are among the many industries reporting results in the week ahead. Netflix reports Tuesday, while Johnson &amp; Johnson, Coca-Cola, and Verizon issue results on Wednesday. Intel and AT&amp;T report Thursday. American Express and Honeywell release quarterly earnings Friday.
*****
&gt; “Earnings have the spotlight in the coming week,” said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. “You’re not going to see economic data upstage earnings.”
*****
&gt; # Data takes a backseat to earnings
&gt; Among the handful of economic reports are housing starts Tuesday and existing home sales Thursday.
*****
&gt; Stovall said he is watching earnings report to see if stocks rally or languish after results. He said earnings for the S&amp;P 500 companies are now expected to be up more than 66% for the quarter.
*****
&gt; “I think what it means is investors are looking at this quarter as a peak quarter in the earnings cycle,” he said. “We’re getting what analysts had expected and then some, but because we are now on the leeward side of the earnings cycle, I think investors are probably going to be taking some profits because their expectations have been met and will not be exceeded in coming quarters.”
*****
&gt; James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at The Leuthold Group, said earnings may be more of a factor for stocks in the much quieter week ahead. In the past week, the market focus was on two days of testimony from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and important data, like the consumer price index and retail sales.
*****
&gt; # Bonds are in the spotlight
&gt; “I think the biggest issue is still going to be the 10-year bond yield,” Paulsen said. He said the key will be whether the 10-year yield falls back to its recent low of 1.25% or breaks above the important 1.4% level.
*****
&gt; “I think the continued drop in the bond yield is scaring investors overall — but particularly equity investors,” said Paulsen. The falling 10-year yield has recently been viewed favorably because lower interest rates are positive for tech and growth stocks. But the yield is now getting attention for continuing to move lower, contrary to the reflation trade and defying forecasts for higher yields.
*****
&gt; Bond strategists have been surprised by the decline, which they blame on a variety of factors. One is a massive repositioning by investors who were short the longer duration Treasury issues and were betting on higher yields. Another reason is there is less new issuance than expected from the Treasury.
*****
&gt; But there are also troubling worries about the economy.
*****
&gt; “What the heck is it telling us? The fears are it’s giving a better read on Covid and maybe a coming slowdown. Growth is good, while it’s not going to be near as good as people thought,” said Paulsen. One worrisome scenario factoring into the lower yields is that the Fed may be forced to tighten policy sooner than expected because of hot inflation, and that could slow the economy.
*****
&gt; Stovall said there’s a chance the bond market is sending a warning for stocks, and it is acting as a canary in a coal mine. But he also sees the yield reversing and moving higher.
*****
&gt; “Our belief is it will move higher by the end of the year, and economic growth will be strong,” he said. “I think the market will continue to watch that because interest rates are so crucial to intrinsic value models and it’s also doing what most people did not expect it to do.”

&gt; # Main Street Sentiment Remains Strong Despite Risks from Speedy Recovery

&gt; Sentiment on Main Street remains strong as the U.S. economy continues to move towards normalcy, but concerns about the impact of a strong but uneven recovery are rising as higher prices, supply chain bottlenecks, and trouble finding qualified workers weigh on businesses’ ability to expand.

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, Main Street sentiment is at its second highest level in over a decade according to LPL Research’s proprietary Beige Book Barometer (BBB), topped only by the June 2021 BBB reading. The result is based on our analysis of the Federal Reserve’s (Fed) Beige Book, a publication released two weeks before each Fed policy meeting that captures qualitative observations made by community bankers and business owners—what we like to think of as “Main Street” rather than “Wall Street.” The BBB gauges sentiment by looking at how frequently key words and phrases appear in the text.

&gt; In the most recent Beige Book, “strong” words had declined slightly while “weak” words fell to their lowest level since the BBB’s inception in 2005. However, expressions of uncertainty had increased and the report did note broad-based pricing pressures. Our sub-index of inflation-related words in the Beige Book remained at its highest level since we created the inflation sub-index in 2015.

&gt; “The economy is picking up speed but has not yet returned to pre-pandemic levels,” said LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “We expect the return to normalcy to continue to support economic growth, but the speed of the recovery also comes with some hazards.” (For more on LPL Research’s economic outlook and its potential impact on markets, see its recently released Midyear Outlook 2021: Picking Up Speed ).

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/7.16.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Mentions of COVID-related words (virus, COVID, pandemic) continued to fall in the most recent Beige Book, as they have in every Beige Book since January, even falling below the level of their initial appearance in March 2020. More concerning, in addition to the persistence of inflation-related words, supply chains also received frequent mention and mentions of shortages remained elevated. The downside of the economy’s rapid acceleration has been a mismatch between demand, which can ramp up quickly, and supply, which comes on line more slowly, while labor markets have also been slow to keep pace with reopening.

&gt; Nevertheless, the fundamental backdrop for the economy remains positive. Upside risks from inflation and disruptions from the Delta COVID variant are on-going risks, but we continue to expect inflation to start to subside as the economy normalizes. Global vaccine distribution will help limit the impact of the Delta variant, although it has led to some new restrictions. US economic acceleration will probably peak in the second quarter, but there’s still plenty of scope for growth to moderate and still remain above average. Much of the positive news is already priced in for equity markets, which are forward looking, and gains may not come as easily, but we still see solid potential for upside as the economy continues to rebound and potentially gains additional support from an improving global economy.

&gt; # A Check-In on Inflation

&gt; This week has provided investors with a fresh batch of data carrying the potential to heavily affect the inflation debate. Tuesday brought us the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for June, while Wednesday saw the release of the Producer Price Index (PPI) for June as well as the start of Federal Reserve (Fed) Chair Jerome Powell’s two-day testimony to Congress providing an update on the economy.

&gt; So has any of this materially changed our view (or the Fed’s) on the great inflation debate? Not really.

&gt; This may surprise some given CPI’s and PPI’s large beats relative to expectations, but at least for the next few months we believe that the composition of the inflationary increases is more important than the headline numbers. Headline CPI jumped 0.9% month over month vs. estimates of 0.5%, while core CPI jumped 0.9% month over month vs. estimates of 0.4%. Base effects from rolling off weak numbers a year earlier meant the year-over-year numbers were even more eye-popping. Meanwhile, headline and core PPI both rose 1.0% month over month vs. expectations for 0.5%. Under the hood, though, the theme of both reports is quicker-than-anticipated reopenings are stretching supply chains. The good news there is that those supply chain dynamics have the potential to improve quickly to meet demand and mitigate the lasting effects.

&gt; This is especially true in the auto, travel, hospitality, and food industries. Semiconductor shortages, which are already showing signs of subsiding, are driving shortages in both the new and used car marketplaces. As rental car companies increase their fleets to meet demand, they are increasingly being forced to bid up a limited amount of existing supply. Similarly, labor supply shortages in the leisure and hospitality sector, as well as airline travel, are restricting supply and causing prices to skyrocket. These components all tend to be relatively small parts of the overall CPI basket, but at the moment they are driving an outsized degree of the volatility.

&gt; All of these phenomena can be described as supply chain bottlenecks, which should eventually resolve themselves. For example, the elimination of supplemental unemployment benefits in September should help increase the supply of labor. Rent prices, though, have a greater impact on overall CPI as they account for 41% of the basket, and increases tend to have greater staying power. While they have risen slightly, they are still under control by historical standards, and play a major part in informing our view that inflation will eventually prove to be transitory.

&gt; Fed Chair Powell’s testimony did not break any new ground on the debate either. While the market did perk its ears up when Powell mentioned that the committee is in “active consideration” over when to begin tapering asset purchases, his characterization of inflation as being mainly transitory and affected by supply chain bottlenecks remained steadfast.

&gt; “The composition of recent data suggests that inflation will largely prove transitory as the Fed has stated,” said LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Just how long ‘transitory’ will prove to be is the big question. We are in the middle of the season when we expected to see some hot prints, so this week has not necessarily been a surprise. But with each passing report market participants will be increasingly anxious to see those numbers start to moderate.”

&gt; What is market pricing telling us about inflation? As seen in the LPL Chart of the Day, the market seems to be largely buying into the Fed’s narrative of transitory elevated inflation so far.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/7.16.21-Blog-2-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Breakeven inflation rates, market-based measures of inflation expectations over given timeframes, rose steadily until roughly the release of the April CPI report when we started hearing about peak inflation concerns. Though that report beat consensus estimates, the subsequent drop in both 5- and 10-year breakevens suggests the market accepted the Fed’s characterization of inflation as transitory.

&gt; And while the levels of these series can be volatile, we believe the divergence that began around the New Year is telling. 5-year breakevens began outpacing 10-year breakevens, suggesting that inflation may run hotter in the near-to-intermediate term, but that the market still has faith in the Fed to keep long-term inflation under control. 5-years making a new local high in the last week without 10-years following suit suggests that while the market is slightly concerned that transitory may prove to be longer than originally thought, it does not believe it will cause concerns on a longer horizon.

&gt; Rents and wages continue to be areas we monitor as tells on whether inflation may be “stickier” than the market anticipates. Our next good look into wage pressure comes on July 30 when we will receive the second quarter Employment Cost Index (ECI) from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. This report is important because it keeps the jobs mix it looks at constant. If there is wage pressure it may not show up in average earnings data if the job mix is shifting to lower wage jobs, as we likely have now, but the ECI would capture it.

&gt; # S&amp;P 500 Equalweight Lagging Badly

&gt; If you've been following the market over the last couple of months, you've likely noticed that the ""mega-cap"" stocks have been the main driver of the broad market's move higher. You can really see this trend when looking at the performance disparity between the cap-weighted S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and the equal-weight S&amp;P 500 (RSP). (Just to be clear, the main S&amp;P 500 index that's tracked closely across the investment landscape is a cap-weighted index, meaning larger stocks have a bigger impact on its performance than smaller stocks. The lesser-followed equal-weight S&amp;P 500 weights all 500 stocks in the index equally. In the equal-weight S&amp;P 500, Apple (AAPL) -- the largest stock in the index -- and Unum Group (UNM) -- the smallest stock in the index -- have the exact same impact on the index's performance.)

&gt; Yesterday was once again a bad day for most stocks as the equal-weight S&amp;P 500 (RSP) fell more than 0.90% on the day. At the same time, the cap-weighted S&amp;P 500 actually closed slightly higher on the day. As shown below, RSP has been stuck in a sideways pattern for the past two months, essentially going nowhere. SPY, on the other hand, has experienced a nice leg higher and is now very extended above its 50-day moving average. Over the last 12 trading days, SPY has closed at a new high 8 times while RSP has averaged a daily move of -0.02%. While the mega-cap growth stocks spent the time from late 2020 through early 2021 in consolidation, it's not the smaller cap stocks in the index that look to have fallen asleep.

&gt; While RSP has been trading sideways for the past couple of months, it's actually still slightly ahead of SPY on a year-to-date basis.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/07/rspspyytdchg.png))**

&gt; As shown below, RSP's YTD lead over SPY has been declining rapidly since peaking in May/June, however.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/07/rspspyytd.png))**

&gt; It's the last two months that have caused RSP to give up nearly all of its 2021 outperformance versus SPY. As shown below, RSP is only up 0.33% over the last two months, while SPY is up 4.64%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/07/rspspy2mth.png))**

&gt; The recent underperformance we've seen from RSP is definitely outside the norm. Below we show the rolling 2-month performance spread between RSP and SPY since RSP began trading in 2003. There have only been two other periods where we've seen the 2-month performance spread turn more negative for the equal-weight S&amp;P versus the cap-weighted S&amp;P. The first was in late October/November 2008 when the entire market was falling rapidly during the Financial Crisis. The second was in late March 2020 during the COVID Crash. These two examples show that we normally see RSP significantly underperform SPY like this when the broad market is falling; not when it's rallying to record highs on a seemingly daily basis.

&gt; # Fewer Bulls Without More Bears

&gt; The S&amp;P 500 is flat on the week but the index did tag record highs on Monday. In spite of this, sentiment has turned lower as the AAII survey showed bullish sentiment fall four percentage points to 36.2% this week. That took out the low of 36.4% from the week of May 27th to make for the lowest reading since the last week of October.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/07/071521-AAII-Bull.png))**

&gt; Some of those declines were picked up by bearish sentiment which rose to 26.8% from 24.5%. Whereas bullish sentiment is at one of the lowest levels in months, that is only the highest level in bearish sentiment since May 13th.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/07/071521-AAII-Bear.png))**

&gt; With bearish sentiment having risen only slightly while bullish sentiment experiences a more significant decline, the bull-bear spread has fallen to 9.4. That is at the low end of the past several months' range.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/07/071521-AAII-Bull-Bear.png))**

&gt; Instead, the losses to bullish sentiment have been picked up by the neutral sentiment camp as this week's reading topped 37%. While late May and early June saw similar to slightly higher readings, that level of neutral sentiment is elevated relative to the historical average of 31.43%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/07/071521-AAII-Neutral.png))**

&gt; Overall, the AAII survey has shown individual investors have become increasingly less optimistic, albeit not outright bearish, over the past few weeks. And while that may be the case for this group, equity newsletter writers have been another story. The sentiment survey from Investors Intelligence (II) covering this section of the market participantshas maintained a more optimistic outlook. This week, 61.2% of respondents reported as bullish which is the highest reading since April. That also comes in the top 5% of all readings since the start of the survey in the early 1960s.

&gt; In the chart below, we show the spread in the bullish sentiment readings of the AAII and Investors Intelligence surveys. This week, that spread fell down to -25 (meaning the percentage of respondents reporting as bullish in the AAII survey is 25 points lower than in the Investors Intelligence survey). That is the lowest reading in the spread since October and it is also in the bottom 5% of all periods.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/07/071521-AAII-II-Spread.png))**

&gt; There have been 20 times in which the spread has dipped below -25 without having done so in the prior six months. As shown, these instances are not particularly rare with about a year or two between each one. But what is notable about the current instance is how elevated the bullish sentiment readings are for each survey. As for what this means for the performance of the S&amp;P 500, in the near term performance has tended to have a negative bias, but moves higher are much more consistently seen in the months to a year after.

I am excited to say I am being promoted and will be making about 120,000/yr. I have never made this much money before and am not really sure how to manage it. 
My fiance make 75k. 

I have a few things questions that I am seeking advice for. Note I am 25 and she is 23.

She has 20k of student debt and I have none. 
Would it be worth just paying it off or continue with our 2 yr plan?

CryptoCurrency,It’s clear why Jerome Powell wants to control digital payments and suppress competitors like USDT/ BCH,"Hearing him talk about the concerns of stable coins and of other digital currency is it clear what the Fed wants. this has an always will be about control, controlling peoples money, controlling where they spend their money controlling where that money goes they want more control with CBDC’s and that’s what they’re going to get. They want to know when and how we spend our money and not only that be able to stop us spending where we want to spend our money. This is why I feel now more than ever alternative forms of payment like bitcoin cash or US DC/T are very important for the future of cryptocurrency in the market as a whole. I do have a strong feeling that they will shut down tether as a means of payment which will temporarily cause liquidity within the market but it will rebound. We have had issues in the past with providing enough assets to back the amount of digital currency that is floating around which leads me to believe they will not let it continue. This is why I believe now more than ever it’s important for us as individuals to speak out against this further form of control and take our own money into our own power. Satoshi started something important and it will not end no matter how much the federal cobra tries to squeeze and put the genie back in the bottle.

personalfinance,Would this be an exception to rolling my auto loan into a new one?,"Okay, so I currently have a 2013 Nissan Altima S. I also have a 576 credit score (working on it, please don't bash). When I bought my Nissan, I got hit with a 22% interest rate doubling what the tag price was making it about $22,000 after interest. The payoff today is a little over $15,000.

So, I was furloughed last year due to COVID and got behind on my car payments unfortunately and now am paying $150/week, $600 a month to keep my account current. That's including the current months of rent on top of my past due balance for 6 months.

Now, onto my question. I was offered $9700 from Nissan via letter (I haven't gone in yet for them to look at it) to purchase the Altima from me.. over 4k more than KBB is offering. Would it be smarter to roll what's left out of the 15000 owed/9700 offered into a new vehicle and walk away with a new vehicle and possibly cheaper car payments (rather than $600 a week)?

My logic says yes to do the deal. Even though i'm rolling these payments into a new vehicle-- I'm imagining that my car payment would be cheaper as long as I'm not at 22% again... please help and let me know what I should do.

I hope this makes sense, please don't bash for the bad financial status. Its a work in progress unfortunately.",finance

Payoff is $340k 
Interest rate is 5.7%. We have excellent credit. Could likely get under 3% on refinance based on my 30 seconds of research.

We are in a red hot real estate area, will probably sell next spring or summer.  2 years at most.


What's the smarter move?  Lower the payment (and balance) or take cash out at a very low interest rate and keep payment the same?

In a distributed system each car would own a Crypto currency and use smart contracts to settle data transfers. 

The type of data transfers would be speed, GPS &amp; proximity data send to smart contracts to aggregate traffic and the payment to other cars for passing or platooning.

CryptoCurrency,Getting off the Titanic.,"I had a friend over a couple of days ago and we talked a little about crypto. We've both have been in it deep for a couple of years now but unlike me he has since done a lot more research.

He told me about a metaphor about fiat and crypto he had heard of, that I found very accurate.

Basically fiat is the Titanic. The unsinkable boat. Or so people think - but it's already sinking. The thing about sinking boats when they are this big is that it takes time.

So nobody outside believes it can sink and the ones on it are clinging to it with all their strength not to fall off. There are life boats all around (crypto) telling people to come over before they drown. Some swim over in a hurry, some just asses the situation and some would rather sink than risk swimming to the life boats through cold water. 

The Titanics captain and his crew, they don't really like the life boats. They prove to people that they are sinking and that leads to panic. So they try to get rid of them by attacking them. So eventually the life boats will leave everyone who is still up there to drown and go to shore with the people they could save.

It's not as eloquent as it was when he described it, but that's pretty much the gist of it. When we consider that every fiat currency in history has gone belly up and the dollar has lost 80% of its value since its inception, without signs of slowing down, while the feds print cash as they see fit, it's just a matter of time before the whole thing sinks like the titanic. And by then I hope as many people as possible can join us on the rafts and move back to shore.",cryptocurrency
XRP,The difference between Bitcoin and XRP,"Full article: [https://write.as/panos/the-difference-between-bitcoin-and-xrp](https://write.as/panos/the-difference-between-bitcoin-and-xrp)

On October 31st 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto published a whitepaper on the cryptography mailing list at metzdowd.com describing a digital currency, titled “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System”. On January 3rd 2009, the bitcoin network was created when Satoshi mined the starting block of the chain. And the rest is history.

Litecoin was the second cryptocurrency that was launched in October 2011, and after that came XRP. The underlying technology of XRP, XRP Ledger (XRPL), was the second major blockchain system and consensus mechanism that was different from Proof of Work that Bitcoin and Litecoin used.

The XRPL was launched in June 2012 by three bitcoin developers who saw the potential problems of bitcoin and Proof of Work and wanted to build something that would not use Proof of Work and mining to validate transactions. The goal was to create a better bitcoin, with a more sustainable and advanced consensus mechanism. The XRPL uses the Federated Byzantine Agreement (FBA) model as its consensus algorithm and it's called XRP Ledger Consensus Protocol.

Bitcoin's maximum supply is 21 million and XRP's maximum supply is 100 billion. The difference is that all XRP were created in the first day, all are in existence today and no more than the original 100 billion can be created. Until Bitcoin's supply reaches its maximum, they are created through the mining procedure, each block generates new bitcoins, which are distributed to the miners as rewards. That's how bitcoin's supply is increasing, while XRP works differently. There are no rewards, no more XRP can be minted and it is also deflationary, as every transaction cost is burned/destroyed, which slowly reduces its supply.

Proof of Work (PoW) consensus algorithm uses the mining procedure to validate transactions. Bitcoin miners act as the network’s transaction validators and verify all the transactions before including them in a block and then adding the latter to the blockchain. By verifying transactions and adding new blocks to the blockchain, miners earn block rewards. This is how new bitcoins are created and are distributed to miners as an incentive to validate transactions and secure the network.

On the other hand, the XRP Ledger Consensus Protocol relies on validator nodes, which are basically servers, to record and verify transactions without incentivizing any party. XRPL Validator nodes are nodes running as a validating server – meaning they are configured to participate in the consensus process for validating transactions and the governance of the network.

Validator nodes are different from miners, because they aren’t paid when they order and validate transactions. For consensus to be reached on the network, at least 80% of the validator nodes must agree. This means that there isn't a 51% attack on the XRP network like on Bitcoin network. Furthermore, on Bitcoin network whichever miner finds the blocks, they are unilaterally responsible for which transactions are approved and go into that block, while on the XRP network (XRP Ledger) the transactions and changes have to be approved by all the validator nodes (&gt;80% for consensus) and not by a single node, like it happens with miners on Bitcoin. This means that the XRP network has a better, more robust and more decentralized structure than Bitcoin and Ethereum networks. But overall, both networks are decentralized, as they have no central authority and no single party can control their networks.

Unfortunately, there is a lot of misinformation in the crypto space, especially against XRP, and it's good and recommended for everyone to fact-check everything and do their own research. This article can help you clear up some of the XRP misconceptions: [https://write.as/panos/why-xrp-is-the-most-misunderstood-cryptocurrency](https://write.as/panos/why-xrp-is-the-most-misunderstood-cryptocurrency)

On average, one bitcoin block is mined every 10 minutes, but a transaction can take much longer, especially if there is a congestion on the network and high usage. The transaction cost can also vary from few dollars to tens of dollars. On the other hand, the XRP Ledger settles transactions in 3 to 5 seconds with a transaction cost of less than a penny (0.0001 XRP on average), and it can process 1500+ transactions per second.

Another difference is that the XRPL has a built-in decentralized exchange (DEX), operating since 2012 and making it the first ever DEX. The XRPL has many great features and you can also issue tokens, IOUs, NFTs and use its smart contract features like escrow and checks.

Bitcoin was designed by Satoshi Nakamoto to be a P2P digital currency system. His/her/their vision was to use Bitcoin for P2P transactions and as an alternative payment system that had no central authority. But after some time, people started to realize that its consensus mechanism, Proof of Work, has many flaws, which lead to bitcoin becoming slow and expensive for what it was designed for. Furthermore, Proof of Work is not a sustainable system and consumes huge amounts of energy, which makes it non eco-friendly.

That's why the XRP creators built XRP and the XRP Ledger as a more advanced, scalable and sustainable system that would be closer to the real Satoshi's vision, regarding P2P transactions. The underlying technology of XRP uses a unique consensus algorithm, which makes it faster and cheaper to send transactions without having to rely on mining, thus making it more secure, eco-friendly and decentralized. In bitcoin, if someone gains over 51% of the mining power, then they can double spend and reverse transactions. Something that is not possible on the XRP Ledger, as it works differently, and over 80% of validators must agree for any change to occur. And there is no way to reverse transactions and double spend like you can do on bitcoin network. This is one of the most important problems of Bitcoin and Proof of Work that the XRP creators solved with the XRP Ledger Consensus Protocol.

Today, many people see Bitcoin as a store of value and a hedge against inflation and not as an efficient system for P2P transactions anymore. Either way, Bitcoin was the first in the market, it started this revolution and it's the reason we are all here today. It opened the way for this technology to show what it can do and allowed for more experiments to be done and better technologies and decentralized consensus mechanisms to be created. There is no reason for tribalism and maximalism. There are countless use cases, markets and problems to be solved by this transformative technology, and each cryptocurrency does its own thing. Like Bitcoin, XRP, Ethereum, all are focusing on different things and use cases. There will not be only one winner. We are in a new internet era.

In the end, blockchain is a revolutionary technology and it is transforming the world. Cryptocurrencies are the evolution of money and finance, and for the people who are here for the technology and the vision of decentralization, must let hatred and tribalism aside and support each other.

1. He needs to receive a lump sum payment since he doesn't have a Roth, 401k, etc.  20% of this payment must be withheld for Federal tax purposes.  The question is, if he has no other income in the US, and the total is less than the standard deduction (it's about $10,000), could he apply for a tax refund in the next fiscal year?  We both assume this to be the case.  Would he just file a tax return next year, or is there anything specific he needs to to fill out?
2. There's an option (it's marked ""optional"") to have 5% withheld for Georgia income tax.  We both agreed this was probably not necessary.  Am I missing something?  Does he actually owe on this?

solar,Solar bid comparisons for Wisconsin home,"Hi all,

Currently have 2 bids for my Wisconsin south facing home. What are your thoughts?

1)  One virtual/over the phone visit - 15x ELECTRONICS LG370N1K-A6 panels, 5.550 kWh, offset 102%. Enphase Energy micro inverters. Cash cost before incentives $18,759 or $3.38/watt. After federal and local incentives, net costs would be $13,381.66 or $2.41/watt. Payback period would be roughly 11.82 years. Sounds like they will be contracting out to option 2 company for the install or someone else. Estimated time to completion and turning on would be in December, but the rep likes to over estimate. There might be some added hidden costs associated with upgrading the electric panel and if I wanted to get an L2 charger installed on the home. Warranties are pretty standard with 25 years on the panels, micro inverters, and optimizers. This company does have a 12 year 0% APR financing option, but that increases the price of install from $18,759 to $24,753. Meets my current demands, but not much room for growth if I want to get an EV and switch over to an electric tankless water heater.

2) Two in person site visits - 18 Tesla solar panels (aka Hanwha Q CELLS), 6.12kWh, offset 114%. SolarEdge inverter that comes with a built in L2 charger. Cash cost before incentives $20,403 or $3.33/watt. After federal and local incentives, net costs would be $14,598.22 or $2.39/watt. Payback period would be roughly 11.21 years. Tesla certified installer doing the install themselves. Estimated time to completion and turning on would be in late September or early October. The rep recommended upgrading the electric panel and is included in this price. I am waiting for this contact to provide clarification on their warranties on the SolarEdge inverter as paperwork states the warranty is only for 10 years, but he stated in his proposal that they are 25 years, otherwise 25 year warranty for panels. This company has an 18 month solar loan for $0 0.0% APR, and increases the price by roughly 2-3%. Buffers in some extra electricity usage for dream items to have in the future, EV and electric tankless water heater.

Both options are without battery storage, but 2) rep mentioned that with the SolarEdge inverter it is easy to hook up a battery if you want to explore one down the road when batteries get a lot cheaper. I am having to convince the spouse into getting on board with this venture and I want to make sure I'm going with the best option out there.

Which would you go with? Or should I venture into getting other quotes?",energy

CryptoCurrency,Crypto Wipe or Save the Economy?,"Edit: I would have posted pictures of charts, but don't know how to do that? 

So I know everyone gets upset when Crypto is targeted in a negative light, and that is not my intention here. My hope is that we can have a rational discussion, as I have found a new love for economics. I wish this post could be seen for people to grow and learn in ways to help their portfolio regardless of what you invest in. I actually enjoy learning and teaching, and would be willing to opt out of gaining moons if it was something helpful to you. 

So getting into the meat of this.
I am currently studying Monitary Policy which is how the US and Canadian Governments run their economy. I am from Canada, and our current inflation rate is 3.6% and the US is at 5.4% last I checked or upon writing this. The inflation rate should be between 1-3% for a healthy economy according to some professionals. 

To combat the rise of inflation according to Monetary Policy, some of the tactics include lowering interest rates, printing money, and creating jobs. 

So in this case the government is printing 2.2T in USD according to [this chart](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CURRCIR) 2021. The vast majority of the American money supply is digitally debited and credited to major banks. The real money creation takes place after the banks loan out those new balances to the broader economy. (Money Supply is approximated). If printing is reduced, the economy collapses  (look this up if you are interested). The money is loaned out at low interest rates so people are willing to borrow. This borrowed money is spent by a consumer at a vendor, and the vendor takes your money to another venter and spends it creating ""Money Velocity"". Money Velocity apparently doesn't directly affect inflation, but the consumerism (Money spending) creates jobs, which does effect inflation. Unemployment Rates dropped heavily due to covid, and have gone back down recently as shown [here.](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/unemployment-rate) 

The problem is that even though the FED is printing money, the money velocity has been dropping since 2000 as shown on this m2 [Velocity Chart](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2V). And at the same time, the S&amp;P 500 has been steadily rising as shown here: [S&amp;P 500 chart](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/spx/charts). Global Crypto Market Cap rose to 2.5T as shown [here](https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/). Currently this has dropped to 1.2T at the time of writing this. 

So far it seems that even thought the borrowing rates are low to create incentives, the people are/were putting their money into investments like Crypto and the S&amp;P500. The banks savings account interest lines up closely with the low lending interest rates, but the Gov't doesn't want you to save money, the system needs you to spend money in order to reduce inflation rates from rising. Investing in stocks or Crypto Currency doesn't lower inflation until you cash out and spend it (not like we have any money left in our portfolios anyways 😄). 

So my question is where do we go from here?",cryptocurrency

There are no rewards, no more XRP can be minted and it is also deflationary, as every transaction cost is burned/destroyed, which slowly reduces its supply.

Proof of Work (PoW) consensus algorithm uses the mining procedure to validate transactions. Bitcoin miners act as the network’s transaction validators and verify all the transactions before including them in a block and then adding the latter to the blockchain. By verifying transactions and adding new blocks to the blockchain, miners earn block rewards. This is how new bitcoins are created and are distributed to miners as an incentive to validate transactions and secure the network.

On the other hand, the XRP Ledger Consensus Protocol relies on validator nodes, which are basically servers, to record and verify transactions without incentivizing any party. XRPL Validator nodes are nodes running as a validating server – meaning they are configured to participate in the consensus process for validating transactions and the governance of the network.

Validator nodes are different from miners, because they aren’t paid when they order and validate transactions. For consensus to be reached on the network, at least 80% of the validator nodes must agree. This means that there isn't a 51% attack on the XRP network like on Bitcoin network. Furthermore, on Bitcoin network whichever miner finds the blocks, they are unilaterally responsible for which transactions are approved and go into that block, while on the XRP network (XRP Ledger) the transactions and changes have to be approved by all the validator nodes (&gt;80% for consensus) and not by a single node, like it happens with miners on Bitcoin. This means that the XRP network has a better, more robust and more decentralized structure than Bitcoin and Ethereum networks. But overall, both networks are decentralized, as they have no central authority and no single party can control their networks.

Unfortunately, there is a lot of misinformation in the crypto space, especially against XRP, and it's good and recommended for everyone to fact-check everything and do their own research. This article can help you clear up some of the XRP misconceptions: [https://write.as/panos/why-xrp-is-the-most-misunderstood-cryptocurrency](https://write.as/panos/why-xrp-is-the-most-misunderstood-cryptocurrency)

On average, one bitcoin block is mined every 10 minutes, but a transaction can take much longer, especially if there is a congestion on the network and high usage. The transaction cost can also vary from few dollars to tens of dollars. On the other hand, the XRP Ledger settles transactions in 3 to 5 seconds with a transaction cost of less than a penny (0.0001 XRP on average), and it can process 1500+ transactions per second.

Another difference is that the XRPL has a built-in decentralized exchange (DEX), operating since 2012 and making it the first ever DEX. The XRPL has many great features and you can also issue tokens, IOUs, NFTs and use its smart contract features like escrow and checks.

Bitcoin was designed by Satoshi Nakamoto to be a P2P digital currency system. His/her/their vision was to use Bitcoin for P2P transactions and as an alternative payment system that had no central authority. But after some time, people started to realize that its consensus mechanism, Proof of Work, has many flaws, which lead to bitcoin becoming slow and expensive for what it was designed for. Furthermore, Proof of Work is not a sustainable system and consumes huge amounts of energy, which makes it non eco-friendly.

That's why the XRP creators built XRP and the XRP Ledger as a more advanced, scalable and sustainable system that would be closer to the real Satoshi's vision, regarding P2P transactions. The underlying technology of XRP uses a unique consensus algorithm, which makes it faster and cheaper to send transactions without having to rely on mining, thus making it more secure, eco-friendly and decentralized. In bitcoin, if someone gains over 51% of the mining power, then they can double spend and reverse transactions. Something that is not possible on the XRP Ledger, as it works differently, and over 80% of validators must agree for any change to occur. And there is no way to reverse transactions and double spend like you can do on bitcoin network. This is one of the most important problems of Bitcoin and Proof of Work that the XRP creators solved with the XRP Ledger Consensus Protocol.

Today, many people see Bitcoin as a store of value and a hedge against inflation and not as an efficient system for P2P transactions anymore. Either way, Bitcoin was the first in the market, it started this revolution and it's the reason we are all here today. It opened the way for this technology to show what it can do and allowed for more experiments to be done and better technologies and decentralized consensus mechanisms to be created. There is no reason for tribalism and maximalism. There are countless use cases, markets and problems to be solved by this transformative technology, and each cryptocurrency does its own thing. Like Bitcoin, XRP, Ethereum, all are focusing on different things and use cases. There will not be only one winner. We are in a new internet era.

In the end, blockchain is a revolutionary technology and it is transforming the world. Cryptocurrencies are the evolution of money and finance, and for the people who are here for the technology and the vision of decentralization, must let hatred and tribalism aside and support each other.

personalfinance,Car Loan: Should I pay it off completely or little by little?,"Hello, I'm 26yr living in NYC. When I went to buy my new car, lot of banks rejected my application because my credit history is only 4 years old and I haven't taken out any loans before. My credit score was 750+ but only credit was through credit card purchases. So I ended up getting an 5.2% interest rate for 72 month loan on $31k which is going to be about $5000 of interest. Hypothetically, if I had the money to pay off the entire loan now, what would be a good strategy in situation where I can still build some kind of credit history and not pay so much interest? I'm thinking:

a) Paying the loan off evenly in about 1 year by paying extra monthly. So about $3k per month.

b) Paying off about $25K in the first month, and then pay the remainder over the rest of year

c) Some other strategy?

I want to build some credit history so if I apply for something like a housing mortgage I don't get slapped with a high rate due to no credit history. Any advice would be appreciated.",finance

The area is pretty cheap (southern illinois to missouri is my commute). I would prefer to not live in the state of Missouri. 

New job offer is with large company, so full benefits, health insurance, 3% 401k match, ESPP, tuition reimbursement, etc. 19.5/hr, PTO accrues slower but is the same amount. There is also a much better chance of growth, and the have told me they would like me to do work with a local sustainability organization(why i went back to school essentially) but the area is VERY expensive and housing is sparse (steamboat springs, CO).

solar,"First quote, trying to understand ROI","Hi all,

Been following for a bit and just got my first quote.

41x Trina Solar TSM-DD06M.05(II) 330W panels
1x SolarEdge inverter - sales guy couldn't say which one yet

Total $43k. Only rebate is the federal 26%, so around $32k. They offered a 20 year fixed 1.5% loan (seems good).

The guy talked the sales up quite a bit. All about the panels being tier 1, strong, extend the life of the roof, etc. He showed me some estimates of the solar hours for different sections of my roof, and said I would have a decent surplus in summer months because I have solid south exposure for most of my roof. System was around 91% capture (forget the actual word he used). He downplayed batteries, saying it basically balloons costs and isn't needed for netmeter homes.

The other salesy thing was their projections for total amount spent on electricity for the next 20 years.

Probably also relevant, I'm in Chicago suburbs. He said right now the netmeter ratio for return is 1:1. He said that was locked in for 15 years by the state, although I am a bit sus of that. Netmeter surplus expires yearly in April each year.

The size of the system seems right, and the interest rate looks really nice. However the ROI seems a bit low and drawn out quite a bit. Maybe I'm missing something. Is their price ballooned quite a bit?

This is more money than I've ever seen but it's just sitting there. I've always been super conservative with my money, but I know I can't always just stash money if I want to achieve my goals. Before I've gotten into my current position, I invested about $250 through Robinhood into Apple, VTI, and VOO with automatic dividend investing about a year ago. I'm currently reading Morgan Stanley's [Guide to Personal Investing](https://www.amazon.com/Morgan-Stanley-Guide-Personal-Investing/dp/0452282632) that was given to me by my grandfather to try and generate a plan before I put anymore into the market. I know this isn't r/investing but I'm just trying to share all information I can. I've read through the [How to Handle $](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics) from this sub, and it was extremely helpful but I feel like I'm in a unique enough situation that drove me to making this post. I'm going to graduate with zero student debt, my living is covered, and I have no current debts outside of credit card usage. I have two credit cards that I think I manage well (stay around 30% usage and pay off in full every month) and have been accumulating credit card cashback rewards since I was 18. Many years ago, I created a budget spreadsheet that I update every Sunday to stay on top of my spending and have a way to see everything all in one place. I don't spend a lot on anything so my outcome is always relatively low.

With all of that said and after reading the How to Handle $, I feel like step 0 through step 3 are covered. I'm not employed but I do have monthly income and hopefully will have a job offer post graduation from my final projects from college, so in the meantime I'm going to educate myself on 401K contributions if that's available then. I plan on buying a car around the time I graduate as my current vehicle is almost 18 years old now. Fortunately enough, I live within walking distance from a bus stop to school so it hardly gets driven anyway. My credit score is good so I don't think getting a reasonable car at a good rate will be a problem when that time comes around a year from now. I think I'm safe to start looking into step 5 and 6 from the list, and that is the main point of this post. I have a general plan but I wanted to make this post to get feedback on it, and hopefully catch anything I've overlooked. The interest rate on my savings account isn't very good so all my money is just sitting there not doing anything. I want to capitalize on this point of my life before I have a house, possibly kids, and other 25-35 obligations learned from this sub.

My primary goal is setting myself up for long term financial security and preparing myself more for the future. I don't have lavish plans for my life, but I do have a few wants before I die. My current plan is to open a Vanguard Roth IRA and make deposits every month first and setting up automatic deposits for investing every month second. At this point, I don't see any other options other than an IRA and creating a long-term moderate portfolio in the stock market. Am I overlooking other options that are available? I don't want to overreach and cut into my emergency fund with monthly deposits before I get more consistent income from my future career. As previously mentioned, I'm about to start my last year of school so would it be more beneficial to wait and continue saving until I graduate and have secured work to make these moves? I'm at a weird crossroad with all this mentally, and I'm looking for advice and critique on 1) my current plan and 2) how to maximize what I have while I'm in the position that I am.

Through MotoRefi it looks like I can refinance my car for a 48-month term at $283/mo at 2.24% interest or I could refinance it for a 36-month term at $370/mo and an interest rate of 1.49%.   


There is also a $400 fee to refinance. I honestly don't understand refinancing vehicles and I'm just looking to save money in the long run, not necessarily lower my monthly payments, as I've always paid more than the minimum anyway. It looks like it's worth it to refinance due to the absurd interest rate I currently have, but I'm not sure if maybe there is something I'm missing that would make it not worth it.   


I don't know if this information is necessarily relevant, but I also just closed on a new apartment and my cost of living will be going up significantly, so maybe paying a slightly lower monthly payment wouldn't be such a bad thing, even though I could still afford the $400/mo payments I've been doing.

personalfinance,How to spend money overseas without incurring bothersome hidden/service fees?,"My wife lives in England and I live in the US (for now). I am going to visit her in England quite frequently and hope to be able to pay for outings/food/etc. while I'm in England without having to pay burdensome 1% service fees every time I make a debit transaction in England. I know of Transferwire, which is great for money-transfers, but I am looking for something that will allow me to spend money in England with lower/fixed exchange rates and **no additional hidden/service fees**.

Any advice? Anecdotes are welcome.

The best solution I can think of right now is opening a new Charles Schwab bank account with a new debit card that I use specifically for my trips to England (since I believe they offer free international spending, but I am unsure if this only applies to credit cards; the wording on the website was confusing).

My primary bank account is with a local federal union, which I love because no nasty hidden fees/amazing customer service/etc., but the catch is that they charge 1% service fee for all overseas spending.",finance

personalfinance,"It feels like Ally Bank stole about $5,000 form us","We started to get a home loan from Ally on Jan. 21 for a home we were planning on moving into a few months after purchasing the house (it needed some renovations).  We wanted a primary residence loan, not an investment property loan because we planned on living in the house for 5 years or so.  They asked us a few questions about our intentions with the property (the answers to which all indicated this would be our primary residence).  The reclassified our loan (on Jan. 29) for the following reasons:

1. We were not selling current (at the time) home right away.  We planned on living there while renovations were happening.
2. The new house was less than 5-10 miles from our (at the time) current house.
3. The new house was considered a downgrade.

This reclassification DID NOT change their loan estimate for ***weeks***.  It was not until Feb. 17 that the loan estimate was updated to reflect this change. Now the loan estimate indicated that instead of receiving about $4,000 in credits for the interest rate we selected, we *owed* $1,000.  At this point we were a week or less out from closing.  Refusing their financing would mean that we would lose the house.

We reached out to Ally through email about this, but we were not able to get any real answers to anything.  We left a review with the BBB on Mar. 2 with the intent to get Ally's attention and get them to fix this situation that they created.  Initially, they were somewhat responsive (on average it took a week or TWO to get a response), but always dismissive.  They acknowledge that we did not see an updated loan estimate because of a ""glitch in their system"".  They refuse to do anything about what they admitted is their fault.

In light of this, we pulled all of our savings out of Ally and are looking for another HYSA in which to stash it.  In order to cancel our account, we have to call in and talk to them, so I will (probably) have to go over this with a representative on the phone on Monday.

Since we have left a review with BBB, we cannot file a complaint with them per their policies.  What would you recommend that we try next?  CFPB?  Just get over it?

&amp;#x200B;

/Edit: Typo in the title....\*from\*

&amp;#x200B;

/Edit again:  We found a loan estimate (Call it B) that clearly states it is an investment property AND that Ally was giving us $4,500+ in credits.

solar,[Question] [California] Has anyone heard of the company Lift Energy and are they trustworthy?,"Hello,

A salesperson from Lift Energy came by asking my parents if they were interested in solar panels? We discussed a lot for a few meetings (details below), but something feels off. Looking at their 155 reviews on Google, they have 4.5 stars. On yelp, it is the complete opposite. There are 18 reviews with an average of 2 stars.

I read the reviews on yelp, and all but 4 are two stars or less. The ones that are five stars are from Bakersfield (1 from  SF), where the company is located. I find that weird. Also, the salesman walking from door to door is named Cam. Cam has had really bad reviews across multiple cities that are super far out from each other. Do they not have other representatives in different areas?

As far as the information they gave us:

Module: Canadian 395 Quantity: 15  

Computer: Enphase IQ-7 Quantity: 15

System Size: 5.924kW

Amount production: 8,399 kWH

Offset 113%

Monthly price after tax credit and interest rate: 108$/month for 25 years

Total Loan Amount: $34,360.42

They were really adamant we signed the same day we met, but I told my dad lets wait to do more research. They then said they would take off $500, then $1,500 if we signed within a week. I am really worried we are going to be scammed because this could ruin us financially if we are not careful. It sounds too good to be true. That is why I am coming here asking for help and guidance.

personalfinance,Home Mortgage Refinance or Equity Line of Credit?,"Hopefully this is okay to post, mostly just need someone to make sure this makes sense to do:

Currently 3 years into a 30yr mortgage at fixed 5% with about $98000 left to pay off (for now and for the foreseeable future we usually just make a couple extra payments per year).

I can refinance to another 30yr mortgage at 2.875%, but will incur $5000+ worth of closing costs to do so. I will be financing these costs. This will lower my monthly principle and interest payment by about $160.

This leads me to paying less over the total life of the loan, but it feels bad to see my debt go up without gaining any property.

The bank is also offering me a home equity line of credit at 3.69% which I could use to pay off my mortgage. This still lowers monthly payment $140 and the bank absorbs the closing costs but charges $50 per year to maintain the account. It also would let me easily borrow more for home projects, tuition, etc.

I'm leaning towards just getting the mortgage.

 I don't currently have projects to spend extra cash on besides maybe a roof within the next year (and I can probably just pay that off over 12 months or so with possibly free financing).

Plus if I need college tuition money in 18years because savings went sideways I can always get a home equity loan/line at that time if that's what needs to happen.

The full cost of the 2.875% mortgage over 360months is ~$157000.

Estimating the 3.69% line of credit would be ~$163,000 over 360 months assuming I don't borrow any more than the current $98000.

stocks,Are interest rates determined by the market?,"I’m spending time learning about finance and in particular stock valuation models like DCF and GGM. These utilize interest rates, generally using the risk free rate of treasury bonds as a sort of benchmark. 

Im a bit confused on how these rates come about. As I understand it, the interest rates are determined by market forces and the inverse relationship between yields and price. If more people buy a bond, price goes up, and yield goes down because the coupon payments are fixed. But if yields are low, people would want to sell bonds because they can get better returns elsewhere. 

Basically I’m confused as to what leads what. It seems to me that decisions about what to buy or sell are dependent upon interest rates and yields. But at the same time yields and interest rates are determined by what people want to buy and sell. It’s circular. Am I misunderstanding something here? Thanks!",finance

I currently owe 139k (1.3k/month plus 200 in HOA fees) in my townhouse at 5% interest rate and Redfin estimate to sell is at 188-205k. 

We are interested and have been viewing houses in the price range of 300-350k (2.3k-2.5k/month depending on yearly tax) and anything we get from selling our townhouse would go towards down payment and closing costs for the forever home (no additional from savings)

Combined income currently is at 6k after taxes, 4% 401k contributions and insurance.

Our monthly bills is at 3.5k (food expenses not included). 1k of the 3.5k goes towards credit card debt which will be paid off in a year. We have around 2.5k left each month for food, entertainment and savings. How much should go to savings? Pay off our credit cards sooner?

Should we take advantage of low interest right now and purchase our forever home or wait after a year when credit card debt is paid off?

Will we even get approved for a 350k home with combined income of 120-135k/year?

Is it possible to keep the townhouse and rent it out and get approved for 2nd loan with my husband for 350k? We earn about the same so will having him co-sign the 2nd loan work?

OR Should I refinance my townhouse for lower interest rate if you guys suggest to wait a year? Will that affect my credit badly? I don’t want to refinance then not get approved a year later because of bad credit. Currently working on my 660-670 credit score.

CryptoCurrency,Zoom out. Really zoom out.,"TL;DR: IMO crypto is in the process of being set up as the fall guy for the next economic collapse.

We're not responsible, as usual it's the bankers greed, government incompetence and regulators not regulating. But when has the truth ever mattered.

Firstly, I'm pretty sure everyone here knows there's a global economic collapse incoming: pandemic, insane money printing, wealth gaps, inflation everywhere, commercial loan CDOs, derivatives etc. It's not if, it's when, as usual.

Let's look at the field of play. Simplified, it's crypto v's everyone else: bankers, governments, hedge funds, central banks, IMF etc. And let's not forget crypto is also full of sharks, provocateurs and psychopaths.

Somebody will be able to do a better job of this, but to simplify it, let's say the teams are crypto v's the global stock markets (NYSE, NASDAQ etc.)

Crypto ($1.3T) v Stock Markets ($90T)

So, it's a team of 1 for crypto against a team of 70 for the stock market. Plus the pitch is slopping towards us and the ref is employed by the stock market. 

This analogy is horrendously simple, but even crypto cap v's Microsoft cap it's 1 v 2! The point I'm making is crypto is tiny in relative terms and unsupported by any major government or global institution.

This is not David v Goliath. It's David v Goliath but Goliath has nukes.

Regardless of what you think of Binance, Tether etc. it would only take a matter of hours for enforcement to turn up and shut them down in times of a global crash. And as we've seen with the FUD and whales whaling, it doesn't take a lot of tweets or huge amount of $ to smash the market. 

Crypto is like the stock market: there's a lot of greed, stupidity, mind-blowingly complicated instruments, leverage and wild speculation all supported by shaky reserve strategies. It got rekt by the pandemic like everything else, and there's an argument to say it only recovered because of money printing and capital pouring into financials. Personally I think the fundamentals are looking good, but we're not at a level where they are solid foundations. Like a lot of people say, it's like the start of the Internet. This just has to do with bad luck and unfortunate timing on cryptos side.

(Well done for getting this far)

So, the economy is going to collapse again and everyone knows it. But the beauty for the bankers and the money printers this time, compared to 2008, there's a handy scapegoat that they can (1) make money on when they pump it up and when they crash it down, and (2) it has such a catchy, media friendly narrative doesn't it: ""2022 Bitcoin cryptocurrency crash"".

They are waiting to regulate the companies sat on chain after the crash. It is far easier then, because there will be chaos, blame and the public will support it. They know they can't regulate Bitcoin fundamentally, 1BTC=1BTC and it's decentralised and limited supply design is a wonder of the modern world. Plus if they tried and it fail, that would look really really bad for them. But they can regulate every major on and off ramp. The tests are already happening.

When the massive stimulus stops, interest rates tick up, the financial markets get exposed (again), housing slumps, businesses go under, savings evaporate and unemployment rockets, the general public, the 99%, whatever you want to call it will be f**ked and (rightly) mad as hell. And the narrative will be it was all cryptos fault. The 99% don't look into the details, they just listen to what the media says, and they will ALL be on message.

It's a lot easier to mandate seatbelts after people have died in car crashes, than before the carnage. That's why they are holding off on major regulation. Wait for the wipe out, then the (surprisingly well prepared) crypto regulation bill(s) will fly through.

Just think how easy it would be in the chaos for the authorities and a handful of lawyers to fly around seeing Binance, Ripple, Coinbase, Charles, Vitalik, Jack et al. ""It's jail or this"". They could hobble and regulate the whole crypto industry in a weekend. We'll mostly likely see the exchanges absorbed by American banks. Name one politician, one government entity, anything that could even briefly slow it down, when the whole narrative is crypto caused the crash, made your constituents lose their money. What about the constitution, freedom, liberty? Easily overcome. Happened in the past: do you want mass surveillance or another terrorist attack? Well, when you say it that way....

Why are banks and financial intuitions moving into crypto though, you may be asking. Money. They are going to pump it then crash it. It is a totally different ballgame when you can blow the whistle anytime you want and you can play any amount of players you want. 

Why would they sell something to their clients knowing that they are going to crash it. Money. These lot don't care about the guy sat next to him, let alone their clients. It's $$$$ dog eat dog. Banks v banks v everyone else. If they are doing that to their clients, they're not going to care about the general public pouring in and being left holding the bag one bit. That is the plan. They'll make money on the way up, money on the way down and money from the default insurance. It's unregulated, unprotected, it's still the wild west in many ways. 

The campaign to ""protect the public"" has already begun. After 2008 the banks got bailed out and all they got was a minor telling off by Congress. What rules or laws would anyone be breaking if they caused a huge pump in the crypto markets and then crashed it on purpose? What could they realistically be charged with that a half decent lawyer couldn't get them off with. Governments will throw their hands up and say they tried but it was crypto criminals. They'll be no public discourse about how there was lots of factors at play here that caused the crash, crypto wasn't the cause, but it will be simplified down to that.

I'll leave it there. Thanks for sticking this out.

Not FA. And I don't know what to do about it either. DYOR.

Just get ready for the heat. Prepare as best you can.

To be positive: I do think blockchain has a huge future, Bitcoin will survive and become digital gold. ETH too, other coins with good teams will find their footing. The worldwide financial institutions want it to stay, so it will. They’re working their play out. It will grow in the longterm. 1BTC=1BTC and in 10years time it could be $500k. It will drop from the public gaze even more and become as fundamental as something like the Internet. But most people will just plug into it and have no idea about the underlining layer and they won't care.

Abstract

		
Cryptocurrencies are all the rage, but there is nothing new about privately produced money. The goal of private money is to be accepted at par with no questions asked. This did not occur during the Free Banking Era in the United States—a period that most resembles the current world of stablecoins. State-chartered banks in the Free Banking Era experienced panics, and their private monies made it very hard to transact because of fluctuating prices. That system was curtailed by the National Bank Act of 1863, which created a uniform national currency backed by U.S. Treasury bonds. Subsequent legislation taxed the state-chartered banks’ paper currencies out of existence in favor of a single sovereign currency. 

The newest type of private money is now upon us—in the form of stablecoins like “Tether” and Facebook’s “Diem” (formerly “Libra”). Based on lessons learned from history, we argue that privately produced monies are not an effective medium of exchange because they are not always accepted at par and are subject to runs. We present proposals to address the systemic risks created by stablecoins, including regulating stablecoin issuers as banks and issuing a central bank digital currency.",cryptocurrency

stocks,"If you started investing this year, don’t fret.","I know I’ve spoken to people on here in the same situation as me. You started investing at the beginning of 2021 and you’ve been trading sideways since you started. Your portfolio has been jumping between positive and negative all-time. I’m not worried and you shouldn’t be either. 

I would assume that most people finding themselves in this scenario aren’t index fund or “safe” investors. You’re trying to build a high growth portfolio for the long term like I am. 

For reference, here is my portfolio breakdown:

“Safer” steady growers - HON, WMT, ABBV, GE, SONY, CLF, NEE*, and BHVN*. I see NEE and BHVN as safer compared to the other high growth stocks I own. BHVN has a very promising pipeline of drugs and has grown a lot as of late. NEE may be the most promising renewable energy company in the market. 

Mega-cap tech - AAPL and GOOGL.

More speculative, high-growth - BABA, AMD, ZG, NIO, NOK, PSFE, PLTR, SOFI, DKNG, MTZ, ETSY, and STEM.

That’s my portfolio. 22 positions as of now. Out of those, here are the ones I’m currently negative in - BABA, ZG, PSFE, PLTR, SOFI, DKNG, MTZ, and GE. Besides GE, the rest of those are more speculative and more or what I would consider high growth. That’s what has been getting hit as of late. I’m not worried because I am confident these companies will do well long term and the stock prices will inevitably go up. In the short term, I’ll continue to average down through DCA. I’ll grit my teeth through the risks of inflation and rising interest rates. Short term it may be rough, but long term I think it will pay off. I will not sell any of these companies. I may add a few “safer” companies or buy up some VTI, but I think this aggressive approach will be well worth it.",finance

I may rent it out for the days im not using the cottage but that isn't my main reason for building it. I plan on starting the build next year fall 2022.

I'm looking into financing options. I can take out a construction loan closer to the date we want to build, but also wanted input on trying to lock in a low interest rate now with a cash out refi.  I owe about 130k on my current home and the value is roughly 450k on the conservative side.  My current interest rate is 3.375% and I would have the home paid off in 2043 if I don't pay more towards the principle.

I was looking into a cash out refi and was recently quoted (looking to pull 200k cash) a 15 year fixed @ 2.375% (Excellent credit).

Would it be wise for me to do a cash out refi now and just put the 200k into a savings account until we build to lock in the low interest rate ? Or should I wait until next year and see what happens with the interest rates? .... another option is pay off my primary home in full  but that would delay the cottage build for me to build up enough of a down payment if I applied that towards paying off my home. I'm not sure tax wise if their are any disadvantages to paying off your home as well that may factor in. 

What are your thoughts? I have the equity for the cash out refi but just not sure what the best way to do this.  

Thanks for the input!",finance

Bitcoin,Is this true? Can it be debunked?,"Saw this in another sub. Would like to hear some truth about it:



Core has rigged the game the same way legacy has.

By instituting a fee market with the blocksize cap they have effectively gamed the network to be a positive feedback loop.

1.	⁠⁠create fee market (institute blocksize cap, had nothing to do with tech capabilities really)
2.	⁠⁠fee market creates competition for transactions thus increasing the price of fees
3.	⁠⁠higher fees ensures hashpower on desired chain
4.	⁠⁠higher hashpower = more security. investors will always choose highest security to store value (hence the store of value narrative and the HODL narrative that decreases liquidity)
5.	⁠⁠more money flows into Core chain and causes fees to scale up with it therefore creating the positive feedback loop of rising fees and investment.

If you follow this logic to its end it will cause Core chain to become so expensive to spend on that only the largest institutions (governments and central banks) capable of using it. Sound familiar right? Then another transactional layer (FEDcoin, LN is a red herring) instituted for plebs to use that will be fully transparent and controllable (if you aren't using your money in an approved manner you are disciplined like Chinas Sesame Credit) by the USG and any other entity that has the access.

Edit: I should also mention that I have a suspicion that the Chinese miners were spamming the network to force legit transaction to carry fees. This would mean the miners are incentivized to not act in the best interest of the network as a whole so all of the Core model is fundamentally broken by the fee market.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Help with paying off Debt,"I was super stupid and naive and it got me in debt. When I was 18 I was so excited to use credit cards I didn’t think about it in the long run and I took out an unsecured loan. I’m 19 now and let’s just say I’m paying for my mistakes.

My question is I have $2000 to use towards my debts what should I pay?

My loan was $3700 but I have to pay back $5800 with a 35.95% interest rate. There is no prepayment penalty. (I know I was really dumb)

Or I can pay off some of my credit cards. I’m in a program for 2 of them that lowers my interest rate and the amount I have to pay each month.  But my other two cards weren’t eligible combined I will have just enough to pay them off one being $600 and the other $1300. Both have a promotional period of no interest if paid in full by 6months ($600) and 12 months ($1300). 

Monthly the loan is $161 
The $600 credit card is $29
The $1300 credit card is $35

I’ve learned from my mistake and I’m planning on taking some Financial classes but until then how should I pay them off? 

All my bills total about $445 a month I’m currently on disabilities which is only $529 a month however I have three job interviews this week so I’m hoping that will change. I honestly don’t know what I was thinking taking out that loan but it won’t happen again.",finance

personalfinance,"If you make every monthly payment on your compound interest loan, is it the same as a simple interest loan","I might be misunderstanding the subtleties. But say I have a loan for $1000 @ 6% for 2 years. It is compound interest loan. My monthly interest rate is 6%/12 = 0.5%, so every month I have to pay $1000\*0.05 = $50 in interest. If I miss a payment, interest will accrue on my loan, and since its a compound loan, the interest will calculated on the principle ($1000) + the accused interest. BUT this is only if I miss a payment and allow interest to accrue. So the only time a simple interest and compound interest loan becomes different is when you miss a payment?

Thanks in advance.",finance

stocks,At what point does interest accrued begun to overtake deposits?,"I have this cool freeware free compound interest calculator.  Not sure where I got it.  Anyways I was fooling aroumd with some minimums today to see how much can be earned from just a little saving.

Anyways I plugged in a modest 8% interest rate and a $200 month deposit and set it for 5 years.  

I started from scratch with 0 initial deposit and see that after 5 years my deposits of $12k were more than the $2080 interest I earned with 8% interest rate.

I noticed that with the same contribution rate ($200 month) and a initial $20k deposit the deposit and interest earned after 5 years were almost equal.

After an initial $20k deposit and the same 5 years, 8% return rate your interest earned started to outweigh your deposits after 5 years.

For example, if I start with $30k and contribute $200 a month at 8% interest rate after 5 years my deposits were $12k and interest earned was $16k.

Noe I'm kind of wondering what factors determine when your interest earned outweigh your deposits.

I would assume that there are multiple factors that could influence this outcome?",finance
CryptoCurrency,"How to earn around 15% return on stablecoin via Anchor Protocol, with full insurance (Both smart contract risk + Stablecoin peg protection). Best risk adjusted return in DeFi","Anchor protocol is based on the Terra ecosystem and offers around 20% APY on UST deposits. UST is the native stablecoin of the Terra ecosystem. However, Anchor by itself does not provide any insurance or guarantee of the interest rate, so it is susceptible to 2 types of risks: 

1. Smart contract risk and 
2. Stablecoin Peg loss risk. 

All DeFi platform and their tokens have exposure to various types of risks risks. DeFi protocols have inherent **smart contract risks**, which come into play when there is a bug that can be exploited or if there are any oracle failures or breaches in the protocol. Hacks, funds drained via flash loans are all examples of these risks playing out and people end up losing their money deposited in these protocols. 

**Stablecoin peg risk** occurs when the peg drops below $1 and does not recover. This can also be caused by smart contract failure of the stablecoin's protocol, or by loss of collateral value etc. For instance, the DAI stablecoin's peg could crash if the MKR protocol gets exploited. Recently, Iron stablecoin had lost its peg irreversibly. In Binance Smart Chain, several stablecoins have lost their pegs. Hence, for users of stablecoins in Defi, it makes sense to obtain a peg protection as well if you are considering holding non-trivial amounts in stablecoin.  

The 20% APY that Anchor provides can be considered as a risky return, no matter your trust in Anchor/Terra and its developers. To mitigate these risks, we will look at 2 insurance products that offer smart contract risk protection and also stablecoin peg risk protection. 

**Nexus Mutual Anchor Protocol cover:**

This cover provided by Nexus Mutual offers protection for contract bugs, economic attacks, including oracle failures and governance attacks. In all, this should sufficiently cover for majority of risks associated with the smart contract and defi operations.

[Nexus Mutual Anchor Cover](https://preview.redd.it/cugiitmkj0c71.jpg?width=3096&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=19a909cdcf82e20b9c1d34f125498f5c21024c50)

Nexus Mutual is a prominent player in the defi insurance segment, and has a track record for paying out claims. If the Anchor protocol/smart contract/oracles gets attacked, you can file a claim and get back any funds that may have been lost due to the attack. This insurance is provided at a premium of around 2.6%. I.e for a 1000 USD cover, the premium is around $26 per year!

**Unslashed UST Peg Protection**

The second insurance we will be getting is the UST peg protection by Unslashed finance. As I mentioned earlier, UST is a decentralised algorithmic stablecoin and thus has a peg risk. To mitigate this risk, it makes sense to get a peg protection. Now, it is hard to find stablecoin peg cover for most stablecoins, however UST has been around for a while and is the largest algorithmic stablecoin, and the 5th largest stablecoin in crypto today with a market cap of $2bn and backed by big partners like Arrington Capital, so there is a UST peg cover provided by Unslashed Finance. 

&amp;#x200B;

[UST Peg Cover by Unslashed Finance](https://preview.redd.it/jq17c7c4l0c71.jpg?width=2178&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2a173b1d2f98b53207e3a6c0c19fdb27fe11e823)

The premium for this cover is around 1.41% a year. So for a cover for $1000, it would cost you $14.1 paid in ETH. 

As always, it is advisable to read the policy cover documents. Both Nexus Mutual and Unslashed Finance have detailed policy documents that go into depth and explain the protection offered, and the exclusions. This is similar to obtaining car or life insurance, you need to acquaint yourself with the insurance policy documents and terms.  

So summing up both the insurance policies, to cover a capital of $1000, we will be paying $26 per year for Nexus Mutual's Anchor cover and $14.1 for Unslashed Finance's UST Peg cover. The Total cover = $40.1 per year. The return from Anchor is around 20% (currently 19.5%), so for $1000, you will be getting around $195 a year, minus the cover, your risk adjusted return = $155. 

With this, you have covered both the significant sources of risks in using any DeFi lending protocol, and still continue to earn a decent 15% return on your stablecoin. 

Considering the low yields on other protocols, and the fact that the yield on Anchor can be insured for both common types of risk, this makes a great play for those looking to earn extra on their stablecoin holdings, but also looking for a non-risky approach! This is a great example to show how far the DeFi industry has come in the last year or so, now you can earn interest and also insure it within DeFi itself!",cryptocurrency

investing,Letting AI Decide your Investments,"Hello  again!  Since my first post here a short time ago (about building a  small position in $GDRX), I wanted to raise another thought about one  strategy for optimizing long-term returns in a portfolio.  I recently  had discovered a fund called the AI Powered Equity ETF.  Most crucial to  know is that it is an actively managed fund, managed by none other than  the IBM Watson supercomputer!  For those who don't already know what  IBM Watson is, it is the supercomputer made most famous on the Jeopardy  show, which was the first ""contestant"" to beat Ken Jennings who had won  millions after remaining the contender for months.  Watson is used in  medical research and has been found to be able to diagnose cancer in patients prior to oncology teams.  It has a sophisticated set of  programs that allow it to comb through many terabytes of data in seconds, and then to use probability calculations to root out the most  likely solution/response/correct answer to a problem or data set it is  fed.  Here's an interesting article about recent performance of the AIEQ in trading momentum stocks that are not typically part of the ""meme  stock"" rallies.

Since one of my portfolios is through M1 Finance, I added a weighting to this  fund, essentially as a way to potentially hedge against volatility in QQQ and some Ark funds I DCA into weekly.  The position is relatively  low in the portfolio (&lt;10%).  While the returns aren't particularly  striking, I think this might be the strength of this fund overall.  I  believe Watson trades not to ""maximize"" returns, but rather to  ""optimize"" them.  Note I don't have any scientific evidence for this.   However, my suspicion is that Watson has an algorithm that uses trend discovery in momentum plays, to target optimizing for risk-adjusted  return.  Aka, ""How can I get you the best bang for the buck, while  simultaneously making your risk the absolute lowest I can?""  Would you  be open to a supercomputer trading for you for a somewhat higher fee?   Could AIEQ be one of the first actively managed funds to consistently  beat the S&amp;P 500 on a risk-adjusted basis, even in spite of its  expense ratio?  Do you think this could be an effective way of hedging  risk against the emotions of other human active managers, or as a  parachute for stocks that take a nosedive in a bear market?

personalfinance,Windfall and House Buying,"Good Day Fellow Redditor,

This is a throwaway because well, it has personal information and I don't want anyone getting wind of this.  

My wife and I are in the process of buying a house.  We literally just got our pre-approval letter from the bank.  In the process of getting ready to move, updating financials, and so forth.  We happened to look into some shares we had from a few years back.  These were part of a compensation plan for a startup.  I haven't worked there for many years.  Turns out they did pretty well for themselves over the years and our stock is actually worth a pretty decent chunk of change.  

So we have the potential to now cash out these shares and we need to decide how to best handle this influx of money in regards to buying the house.

In some ways, it seems that we might be wise to stick the funds into some stocks and try and grow the money, especially given low-interest rates on the mortgage.  Although that in itself could be slightly risky, just ask my current stock portfolio how the last couple of weeks have treated it.  In other ways, it would be really nice to own the home free and clear and only have property taxes and insurance to pay and then invest the rest of it.

I'm sure there are also 100 other possibilities that I haven't thought of.  

So hit me with it, how should we handle this?  The amount is significant us, very low 7 figures.  Life-changing in many many ways.  We don't want to screw it up.  Getting a house is a must, but we are already qualified, so we don't have to use it that way if that isn't the best option.

4. Professor Aggelos Kiayias recently dropped a video explaining exactly how Mithril (apparently neckbeard dungeon master talk for elf armor) is going to allow for Perfect Cardano (ADA) wallets that combine the ease of use and convenience of light wallets with the trustlessness of full node wallets. We also learned exactly how Mithril is going to work. [https://youtu.be/LhepJFCyWRk](https://youtu.be/LhepJFCyWRk)
5. In proof-of-work, bootstrapping can be done with blockheaders. This won’t do in proof-of-stake since we need information about stakeholder distribution to confirm block validity.
6. Mithril fixes this by being a cryptographic construction that enables a population of stakeholders to issue a signature consistent with certain constraints.
7. For Mithril to work in proof-of-stake, it needs three crucial properties: 1) it needs to enforce a threshold ratio of stakeholders before the signature is issued; 2) the pre-signature fragments must be independently verified and subject to public aggregation; and 3) it must be efficient in the sense that the final signature is of constant size and is logarithmically dependent on the # of stakeholders.
8. Stakeholders will issue special Mithril keys along with the normal cryptographic key material. Then at regular intervals, full nodes will test whether they can produce a pre-signature fragment. Only a random subset of stakeholders will be eligible to produce a pre-signature fragment. When a sufficient # of pre-signature fragments have been issued by eligible stakeholders then it will be possible to aggregate the fragments into a final signature.
9. This will be a checkpoint that will be verifiable with respect to previous check points all the way back to the genesis block. Such checkpoints will be cryptographic commitments of the relevant UTXOs.
10. Since the checkpoints will be trustless, a light client (i.e. wallet) will only need to verify the sequence of checkpoints up to the current time to trustlessly bootstrap.

17. The U.S. Currently has Issued Sanctions on Ethiopia, but they are not all-encompassing economic sanctions as with rogue nations, they have just barred entry into the U.S. for certain government personnel.

18. Vitalik is saying it’s highly unlikely we see ETH 2.0 before late 2022. I’m guessing that means mid 2023 which will be after two years of Cardano slaughtering the entire ETH user base. Things are looking so bad that Vitalik says he doesn’t even like using the ETH 2.0 label anymore since he knows the changes will be more incremental. This is what early capitulation sounds like guys.

21. Binance has 63 stakepools charging 6%. Please stop paying so much for the right to stake your ADA. You don’t have to pay that much. You have a huge number of better options. You are literally giving away your ADA rewards to a large corporation. It’s easy: just download the Yoroi Chrome extension, send your ADA there, and pick from the 2k+ available stakepools right inside Yoroi.

32. The Marlowe Webinar with Shruti is now available on youtube. Very interesting discussion of DeFi in general and also specific topics like “deep interoperability” in DeFi. Cardano is obviously already doing the very involved thinking about the future of DeFi. [https://youtu.be/vzsUSG5CSj0](https://youtu.be/vzsUSG5CSj0)
33. John O’Connor recently tweeted about a day where he “wrote a letter to a president” and “found a million users to bring into Cardano”. Sounds like the Cardano train is rolling along as smoothly as ever in Africa. [https://twitter.com/jjtoconnor/status/1402565547716399104](https://twitter.com/jjtoconnor/status/1402565547716399104)
34. Zach Guzman and Mike Novogratz get an opportunity to prove once again how extremely threatened they are by the fact that they can’t frontrun Cardano at this point. [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1404100510525841408](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1404100510525841408)

36. President of Tanzania calls on the central bank to prepare for the adoption of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. I wonder what crypto ecosystem already has experience working with an African government on a big crypto project and has partnered with a mobile company that is already bringing connectivity to rural Tanzania?

37. Hedgefund Billionaire Paul Tudor Jones tells the world to buy crypto and certain other assets if the Fed doesn’t address inflation in their policy meeting that concludes on Wednesday. JP Morgan’s Jamie Dimon concurs that the current inflation is very likely not transitory. This could be tremendously good timing for Cardano given our top five status and the impending mainnet launch of smart contracts.

41. While renewable energy is certainly a wonderful thing, there may be a problem with your technology when your path to compete on clean energy consumption involves you talking about harnessing the power of a whole series of volcanoes. Maybe just use fewer volcano’s and more proof-of-stake? [https://twitter.com/\_eLaPs\_/status/1404125569093029889](https://twitter.com/_eLaPs_/status/1404125569093029889) [https://twitter.com/gladstein/status/1402718041557725184](https://twitter.com/gladstein/status/1402718041557725184)

49. It’s a good sign that the top two crypto communities are spending so much time talking negatively about Cardano. You only focus your hatred on that which is most threatening. I’m glad to see we’re the biggest threat on their radar. [https://twitter.com/nic\_\_carter/status/1405194146063736840](https://twitter.com/nic__carter/status/1405194146063736840)
50. Bloomberg just published a piece called “America Should Become a Nation of Renters”. While this statement is probably extremely polarizing for Americans, it can also be argued that the death of homes as the primary investment vehicle of Americans may open up a new wave of adoption in crypto as an alternative.

53. Days like today in Cardano and the greater crypto space always reminds me that there have been other great adoption stories that went through periods like this.[https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1407077949774442499](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1407077949774442499)
54. It looks like the second biggest ETH stakepool or it's custody provider has lost it’s users private keys to $75MM in ETH. Cardano doesn’t have this problem. We get to keep custody of our crypto because we found a better way than slashing. [https://stakehound.com/blog-post/fireblocks-eth-2-key-management-incident/](https://stakehound.com/blog-post/fireblocks-eth-2-key-management-incident/) [https://twitter.com/JamesSpediacci/status/1407465311180255236](https://twitter.com/JamesSpediacci/status/1407465311180255236)

57. The June Cardano 360 is currently available on Youtube. [https://youtu.be/al5m14299ww](https://youtu.be/al5m14299ww)
58. We saw segments on various newer partner entities like Nervos, Orion Protocol, and Revuto. Nervos is a UTXO proof-of-work blockchain which is building a cross-chain bridge with Cardano so that you can use your ADA on Nervos dApps and vice versa. Interoperability is a big theme for Nervos and they plan to have a working testnet within a month. Orion Protocol is building a terminal that will allow for decentralized non-custodial trading across centralized and decentralized exchanges. They say this would not require you to KYC or even have an account with any of these exchanges. Revuto is an online subscription management service that recently completed a $10MM token sale on Cardano.
59. It was also revealed that Wolfram Labs, COTI, and IOHK have a three-way partnership (a ménage à tech) to build an NFT auction site. The people from Wolfram were talking about very interesting things including live minting during streaming events and automated upload to IPFS. COTI will be building out auction and bidding mechanisms in ADAPay.
60. Professor Aggelos Kiayias gave us an update on research including that Ouroboros Chronos and Hydra papers have both been accepted into conferences/journals. Chronos will provide Cardano with a global concept of time that doesn’t rely on any outside timekeeper. Prof. Kiayias also pointed out that Hydra is distinguishable from other layer two protocols in that the scripting language is identical to that of the base layer in Cardano such that any dApp that can run on Cardano will run on the Hydra L2. This is a huge plus and superior to many other layer two solutions in other ecosystems where the base layer dApps will not run on layer two. Finally, the Mithril paper has been submitted for peer review. It will provide Cardano light wallets with Succinct Non-interactive Arguments of Knowledge that will give us the best of both worlds: no delays for syncing as in full node wallets while still preserving trustlessness.
61. Finally, the Goguen Summit will be in late September. Sign up now at [summit.cardano.org](http://summit.cardano.org/).
62. The Fed is once again STRONGLY signalling to us that they are going to regulate stablecoins. The Fed is also specifically calling out Tether for the first time. You need to be thinking about how stablecoin regulation might affect your favorite Cardano DeFi or other project. [https://twitter.com/CaitlinLong\_/status/1408500265397985282](https://twitter.com/CaitlinLong_/status/1408500265397985282) [https://twitter.com/CaitlinLong\_/status/1408572624125534212](https://twitter.com/CaitlinLong_/status/1408572624125534212)
63. People are starting to realize that the Stakehound private key loss in ETH may attract unwanted regulatory attention to Ethereum 2.0 while this problem could never have occurred in Cardano. Also, only a few days later another ETH stakepool (this time SharedStake...the sixth biggest ETH Stakepool) allegedly experiences a rugpull that some are valuing at over $30MM. This is another problem that could not happen in Cardano staking. It feels like we stepped into the ring, they rang the bell, and ETH just started punching itself in the head. Eventually it’s going to KO itself.

79. Robert Kornacki of dcSpark releases an article on why every Cardano dApp will use NFTs. The article contains some very interesting discussion on smart contracts in the EUTXO context including language instructing that “UTXOs have smart contracts attached to them and not the other way around” and “\[...\]the simplest way to think about it is that when a UTXO is created it has the option to have a smart contract attached to it.” [https://medium.com/dcspark/every-eutxo-dapp-will-use-nfts-and-heres-why-fd87e6a8c9a6](https://medium.com/dcspark/every-eutxo-dapp-will-use-nfts-and-heres-why-fd87e6a8c9a6)

personalfinance,Take a personal loan or pay credit cards as is?,"I have about $20,000 in credit card debt because college me was an idiot and spent without thinking while making minimum wage. Currently, my monthly take home income is around $3,000 not including any overtime or part-time (which there generally is but I'm not factoring that in). My monthly bills currently sit around $2,000 a month, including my minimum credit card payments. For both credit cards, the combined monthly payment is around $500 with interest rates of 17 and 19%. My credit union will give me a loan for the amount I owe for around $600 a month at 15% for 45 months. Just paying my bills as they are leaves me with about $1,000 for expenses like groceries and gas, or $900 if  I take the loan.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's the kicker, I'm planning on taking a new job, pending getting hired but it looks promising. My income for the first year at the job would be lower, about $200 a month less. After the first year, I go to about $3,100-3,200 a month. With this new job, I would expect to start in January and in July would potentially have to relocate to wherever they want me to go in the state. For the highest cost of living area in my state, they offer a pay bonus to offset that, but I'm doing everything in my power to avoid going to that area. 

I'm looking for advice as to whether I should take the loan, pay off my credit cards and just make payments on the loan, or pay the cards as is.",finance
CryptoCurrency,Learn: What the h*** is a stablecoin?,"- Hi guys 👋, during a two-hour car ride, I chose to look into stablecoins, as I saw enormous interest rates. So below is the information I gathered from a range of different sites and put together for myself, and now for you guys. Sorry for potential layout mistakes, as I’ve put this together on my phone 😂. Enjoy!

Basically, stablecoins suggest a new alternative for reducing price volatility in the crypto landscape. The volatility makes cryptocurrency somewhat unreliable as a suitable currency for exchanging goods and services. So, the best stablecoins which have emerged in the crypto space have solved this problem. By nature, stablecoins are highly fixed in terms of value when compared to general cryptocurrency alternatives. 

According to a report by CB Insights, the overall value of stablecoin assets has crossed well over $20 billion in late 2020. Stablecoins have gained traction as they attempt to offer the best of both worlds—the instant processing and security or privacy of payments of cryptocurrencies, and the volatility-free stable valuations of fiat currencies.

They promise lower volatility, which makes them useful for converting between fiat and other cryptocurrencies. Some of the most prominent examples are: USDT, TUSD, DAI, PAX, GUSD.

What makes fiat currency free from extreme volatility? 

When a fiat currency’s valuations may move drastically, the controlling authorities jump in and manage the demand and supply of currency to maintain price stability. The bulk of cryptocurrencies lacks both these key features - they don’t have a reserve backing their valuations and they don’t have a central authority to control prices when required. Stablecoins attempt to bridge this gap between fiat currencies and cryptocurrencies.

The different types of stablecoins

Stablecoins can be fixed to almost anything in theory, there are Stablecoins fixed to multiple fiat coins and even to precious items like gold or silver. Four main categories exists: 

Backed by a commodity: Stablecoins that are pegged against commodities generally have the backing of hard assets for stability. The hard assets could include real estate or gold. 

Backed by a crypto asset: Crypto-collateralized stablecoins are backed by other cryptocurrencies. Since the reserve cryptocurrency may also be prone to high volatility, such stablecoins are “over-collateralized”—that is, a larger number of cryptocurrency tokens is maintained as reserve for issuing a lower number of stablecoins. More frequent audits and monitoring add to price stability. However, because the crypto values themselves are not stable, these Stablecoins need to use a set of protocols to ensure that the price of the stablecoin issued remains at $1.

Backed by fiat currency: Fiat-backed cryptocurrencies as the most commonly accessible stablecoins. Such types of stablecoin have the backing of fiat currencies such as the US Dollar, Euro, or Chinese Yuan, which are kept as collateral (a fiat currency reserve is maintained). Such reserves are maintained by independent custodians and are regularly audited for adherence to the necessary compliance. Production and liquidation of the coin is carried out by the issuer of the coin. 

Backed by an algorithm: Non-collateralized stablecoins don’t use any reserve but include a working mechanism, like that of a central bank, to retain a stable price. For instance, the dollar-pegged basecoin uses a consensus mechanism to increase or decrease the supply of tokens on need basis.

But… but… but…

Placing you money in a stable coin is not without its risks as many stablecoins lack consumer protections and provide patchy, frequently unaudited accounts of the reserves meant to back their coins. Tether, the $60bn stablecoin, was fined $18.5m by the New York attorney-general over allegations it lied about its reserves. 

When should you care about stablecoins?

If you cannot keep a close eye on market conditions or changes, or if you are simply not familiar with all these, it may be wise to keep your digital assets in Stablecoins. Also, during bearish market times, you can favourably keep your digital assets in stablecoins. 

Why are they interesting? 

With stablecoins you can minimise volatility, trade or save assets, transfer money cheaply, send money internationally, and lastly the one I’m going to focus on here, you can earn interests. 

Currently, exchanges like crypto.com offer up to 14% (!!!!) p.a. Interest on certain stablecoins. To me, that sounds ludicrous, as my bank currently offers me next to no interest (some even make you pay for keeping your OWN money with them). So what is going on in the crypto space? 

How can you get a hold of these high interest rates?

By using a third-party crypto loan platform - you will be lending your stablecoins out. In return, you will be paid a rate of interest that in many cases is significantly higher than what you can get through a traditional savings account.

Your chosen crypto loan platform will charge the end-user a higher rate than what you receive in interest (called the spread) – this is how the provider is able to pay you. 

However, there seem to be two main risks: (1) As mentioned earlier, a stablecoin provider needs to hold a reserve of an asset, so at some point it comes down to trust, and their ability to keep the reserve intact. (2) You need to consider the safety of the platform itself. After all, it is not the stablecoin provider that is paying you interest. On the contrary, this is paid by a third-party that collects digital currencies from depositors and then lends the funds out via a loan agreement. Furthermore, you are NOT insured.

Lastly, you should be aware that most places (if not all?) you have to “lock up” your stablecoin holding for a certain period of time to accrue the “abnormal” interest rates. 

TL;DR - You can place your savings in high interest stablecoins, but it is, in theory, at the risk of losing your entire investment.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Negotiating interest on a furniture loan,"Looking for advice on negotiating a lower interest rate/payoff on a furniture loan. My girlfriend financed a set of furniture from Jerome's Furniture 2 years ago under a promotional deal. The contract she signed indicates that if the furniture is payed off within 2 years of purchase, no interest will be charged on the loan. This 2 year period ended on 7/5/21 and my girlfriend had \~$1000 left on the loan. She has made at least the minimum payment since first receiving the loan. What she didn't realize is that the minimum payment does not add up to the total cost of the loan if paid every month and she has not been tracking her balance. Earlier today, she got a notification that \~$1200 has been added to the total cost and she will now be charged 30% interest until the loan is paid off. This brings her total to \~$2200 on what was originally a $2600 set of furniture. This is obviously frustrating for both of us and a massive financial hit. We can afford to pay off the full $2600 balance in about 3 months but I would rather call the financing company and try to negotiate a full payment of a lower amount in one lump sum. My girlfriend thinks this is pointless and is resigned to paying the full amount. I don't know if I have any authority to call and negotiate on her behalf since my name is not on the loan. Is it generally worth trying to negotiate with credit companies or will they simply tell us we're out of luck? 

tl;dr: girlfriend failed to pay off entire furniture loan in time and is now being charged an additional $1200 as well as 30% interest until loan is paid off. Will the credit company work with us if we offer to pay a large amount in one lump sum?",finance

Forex,Trading EUR/USD this week: ECB expected bearish for the euro,"Hi traders, here is my full weekly outlook for EUR/USD. For the full post with plenty of charts, please [click here](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/EURUSD/8CvdSreL-EUR-USD-weekly-outlook-The-1-17-level-in-sight/).

&amp;#x200B;

**Fundamentals: Dovish ECB to send the euro lower**

The EUR/USD pair continued to trade in a narrow range last week as markets' focus shifted towards the July ECB meeting. Once considered a non-event, the central bank is about to unveil a new monetary strategy, with market expectations set for a dovish shift. The bank has previously announced that the PEPP will run at least to March 2022 and adopted a new inflation target from ""below, but close to 2%"" to ""2%"", which, itself, somewhat dampened expectations of earlier policy normalization.

Over the Atlantic, Fed's Powell tried to reassure markets that inflation is only transitory, providing the example of the rise and fall of lumber prices as something the Fed would like to see more of. Still, Powell's testimony was not enough to trigger a recovery in global risk appetite, although the last week's risk correction seems somewhat overextended.

The fall in US Treasury yields, combined with a quiet week in the United States data-wise, could see a weakening US dollar in the coming week. However, a dovish ECB and elevated risk aversion (which is my base-case scenario) could still send the EUR/USD pair lower (while providing support to other cyclical currencies).

&amp;#x200B;

*Upcoming Market Reports:*

Here are the most important market reports for EUR/USD to follow in the coming days (all times are UTC timezone):

**Intermarket: Yield differentials not enough to provide bullish momentum**

\[chart\]

Looking at the 2-year yield differential between US Treasuries and German bunds, it's obvious that the recent slide in UST yields caused a spike to the upside, forming a potential bullish divergence . However, EUR/USD doesn't seem to care much as the USD remained supported on risk aversion this morning. Soaring covid cases worldwide are a threat for global risk sentiment, which in combination with the ECB meeting, is a double bearish sign for EUR/USD .

&amp;#x200B;

\[chart\]

Another argument in favor of further downside in EUR/USD is the US dollar index . DXY reached the highest level in almost four months, despite falling yields across the US yield curve. The 92.80 level acts now as an important support for the DXY , followed by the 92.50 level (61.8% Fib), and 92.10 (weekly lows).

&amp;#x200B;

**Sentiment: USD short-covering continues, putting upside pressure on the currency**

*CoT:*

The latest CoT report shows a sharp fall in USD short positions, with the aggregate short more than halving to just $3.6 billion. This is the smallest net short positioning since March. Most of the USD short-covering came from the euro . The net long positioning in the single currency tumbled by $2.6 billion, mostly as a result of more short positions in the currency.

&amp;#x200B;

*Options:*

\[chart\]

EUR/USD risk reversals, as of last Friday, show that put options are becoming relatively more expensive compared to similar out-of-the-money call options, which signals that investors are increasingly preparing for further weakness in the EUR/USD pair. This is especially true for options expiring this week.

&amp;#x200B;

In the FX market, risk reversals refer to the difference between the implied volatility of the most popular out-of-the-money calls and puts with the same expiration. Higher demand for an options contract increased its volatility and price. Therefore, a positive risk reversal signals that upside protection in the pair is relatively more expensive than downside protection, suggesting that investors are speculating on a rise in the currency.

**Technicals: Bears eye the 1.17 level**

From a technical standpoint, the EUR/USD pair continues trading in a slight downtrend, with the range of the last two weeks likely acting as a bearish accumulation phase. The 61.8% Fib level keeps holding, forming a rather strong resistance level in the upper 1.18 area. This area aligns with a previous fake breakout and the post-FOMC dollar slide and is very likely to attract strong selling pressure in case the pair makes it to those levels.

This morning, the pair broke below last Friday's range and was last seen trading at 1.1785. The new bearish structure, in combination with increasing volume and wider open-close ranges, signals a higher supply of the pair and the potential for a break below the all-important 1.1770 monthly support.

&amp;#x200B;

**Summary: Bearish bias**

I am bearish on EUR/USD this week, based on market sentiment, positioning ahead of the ECB meeting, and elevated risk aversion. The PoC near the 1.1810 level (the level with the most traded volume on Friday) could be used for bears to enter into an attractive risk-reward trade.",finance
stocks,Here are the major factors contributing to a very possible market correction soon,"I am not a market expert but I have been observing red flags piling up recently and it’s wise to pay close attention to them as they point to a near market correction including: 

**Low market breadth and divergence:** there are fewer stocks rising versus ones declining, and a larger number of stocks are hitting the 52 week low than the ones hitting the 52 week high. 

**Overbought stocks:** such as AAPL, AMZN, MSFT, NVDA, and ARKK all have recently breached the 70 RSI overbought marker and are now dropping fast. This ties in well with the poor market breadth as allot of the money existing other stocks as they sell off is just pilling in few top stocks in an unstained way, hence the overbought flag. 

**Reduced volumes:** signal weakness in the market and provoke profit taking. For example the Russell 2000 average volume has dropped to just under 3 billion per day from a three months average of 3.7 billion. Incidentally this index tracks 2,000 small cap US companies which have been dropping for most of the last 3 weeks for a total decline of 7.3% thus far. 

**Major trend line broken:** for the second time in less than one month the S&amp;P 500 has dipped under its major trend line. The first time on May 18th, it reversed and went back up on the back of decent labor and production reports plus earnings expectations. Now that earnings are underway and most economic indicators are pointing to growth peaking it might not be able to reverse the drop. 

Obviously all of the above are technical indicators that try to explain market behavior based on historical metrics, but they don’t explain the reasons behind such changes. We have to look at economic news to identify causes including: 

**Peaking economic recovery:** several reports this month point to an economy that has reached peak recovery. For example, both the services PMI 64.6 vs 65.2 vs 64.8 (actual, forecast, previous) and ISM 60.1% vs 63.3% vs 64.0% reports for June show a declining rate of expansion. Also, industrial production is showing similar pattern 0.4% vs 0.6% vs 0.7%.

**Mixed Q2 banking results:** also point to the same issue above. While the overall figures are up, the details point to absence of loan growth and net interest margin weakness. 

**Declining consumer sentiment:** while consumer spending came in higher than expected for the month of June consumer sentiment declined from 85.5 to 80.8. The main driver behind this is inflation.  

**Inflation rising:** the FED has been harping on inflation being transitory because of the “base effect” and some temporary supply constraints. Their timeline for all of that to sort out was few months. Now it’s more than few months and inflation continues to rage registering the highest figures in over a decade with Core CPI (the Fed’s favorite metric) registering 0.9%, the highest increase since 2008.

Furthermore, the PPI (producer price index) also continues to rise at a rate of 1% in June indicating that consumers are still going to see higher prices in the coming months and that overall inflation will overshoot the FED’s 2% threshold by a wide margin. 

**Reemergence of a new variant:**  the delta variant is causing allot of lock downs and interruption throughout the world. While its effect in the US might be limited, a slowing world economy does not bode well for stocks in general, hence perhaps the reason why bonds have gone up. 

**Bond yields going down:** usually indicates that an economy is slowing and investors are looking for safer assists. Many have pointed out that bond yields usually peak 3 months in advance of the stock which they did in March. Since we are in July and bond yield continue to decline many think the bond market is sniffing out something and reacting to it. Remember, the inverse relation between bonds and yields. 

**China’s Crack on tech:** has rattled some investors especially that it came at a time when that market was showing sign of bottoming out. 

All of those events point to a possible correction sometime in the near future. Most experts expect that sometime after Q2 earnings, but it could be starting as we speak, especially that corrections don’t play out in one straight line. They tend to move in a series of several lower lows and lower highs until bottoming out. 

It’s important to also point out that a correction is not a market crash. Corrections are a much smaller event, ranging around a -10% drop on the low end for the leading S&amp;P 500 index and much more for individual speculative stocks. They are a healthy event that helps reinvigorate the market with new buyers. 

A crash on the other hand is a much larger event that’s usually provoked by a combination of events or a single major event. Crashes usually last much longer than people expect, well past the initial large drop. 

There are several catalysts for such an event such as the emergence of a virus variant that outsmarts vaccines or a collapse in the reverse repo facility. The most prominent of them however, is QE tapering (quantitative easing) and increase in interest rates. 

Massive QE and low interest rates have been the driving force behind this bull market. They are the justification given for the current astronomical valuation where the S&amp;P500 Shiller P/E ratio is reaching a whopping 38%! That is a historic high only second to the Dotcom bubble in 2000 (44%) and is in general an unsustainable level in the long term. 

Some argue that the FED will manage to taper QE and increase interest rates gradually in a very controlled manner and avoid any meltdown, but given rising inflation beyond expectations, the FED might very well be forced to act much sooner than it would like. Equities and bonds expert Ray Dalio explains this process in his most recent video on YouTube.",finance

The next 6 months are going to be a wake up call for a lot of people in crypto and meme stocks 

The last 12 years since the 2008 crash have been a hyper investment period. Almost all sectors at one point entered a bubble. Crypto, energy, technology, healthcare, EVs etc....

Unfortunately the FED broke the money system last year and the party may be coming to an end. Crypto has seen the biggest jump in history backed by literally FOMO and nothing else 

Everyone made money bud. It wasn't your genius strategy. It was literally the easiest time to make money in the market in human history 

While I don't 100% agree with M. Burry; he is right that a major BTC correction is coming. DCA isn't going to work when 90% of crypto goes to $0 

ETH and BTC and maybe a few might survive the mega crash but BTC is now proofing out to $12,500.00. On almost all major models. On chain data suggesting a fair value of $10,000.00 from $20,000.00 in May 

A relief  rally with a max cap of $56,000.00 is still possible but the only model that supports that is Wyckoff and nothing else 

The trigger may be a -10% correction in the NASDAQ

When shit like SPCE jumps 40% because the founder said I'm going to space. You know the market it fucked 

GME, AMC, DOGE and TSLA have been the biggest warming signs in 20 years

It doesn't mean that there won't be money to be made but it's just going to be way harder. No more 50x gains on Dog coins and 10x on ghost chains that have no use function 

ICP was worth $700 and MINA a $187. They  are now $30 and $1.20. With the bottom being around $2 and $0.50

We all just need to put in the work and stop with the HODL and DCA memes. A lot of people are going to get REKT and its time this sub takes responsibility and educates people about how near the cliff we are",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,What length term for student loan refi?,"I want to take advantage of rates these days and I'm looking at two scenarios. I have undergrad and law school loans, from various lenders/servicers and some have been refi'd already:
$56,000 at 6.55% (federal, Nelnet)
$7500 at various low rates 1-2%, not touching these (federal, Navient)
$51,000 split at 5% and 4.375% (started out federal, two private refis,  SoFi)

I want to keep the federal loans because I like the protections they give me, even though a large amount are at my highest interest rate. I currently throw an extra couple hundred a month at them, and after the Covid relief period is over I'll be able to pay off about $14k of them.

The rate quote I got for the $51k of Sofi loans was 2.5% for a 5 year term or up to 3.72% for a 20 year term. I only have 5 and 7 years left on them but if I do the 20 year term, the payment is $600 less per month, which I could then turn around and throw at the high-interest Nelnet loans. If I'm going for the avalanche method and will be paying $xx toward all loans each month regardless of min payments, does that make more sense? That also gives me more flexibility if I were to become unemployed, etc. It's $600 less I have to pay in a worst-case scenario. I know over 20 years the interest would be insane but I'm going to pay them off in 5 years anyway so does it matter that much?

I think I'm having some cognitive dissonance about wanting to keep the federal loans for the protections, but also they're the ones I'm throwing extra money at to pay down. Am I getting something backwards here?",finance

### Abstract

Cryptocurrencies are all the rage, but there is nothing new about privately produced money. The goal of private money is to be accepted at par with no questions asked. This did not occur during the Free Banking Era in the United States—a period that most resembles the current world of stablecoins. State-chartered banks in the Free Banking Era experienced panics, and their private monies made it very hard to transact because of fluctuating prices. That system was curtailed by the National Bank Act of 1863, which created a uniform national currency backed by U.S. Treasury bonds. Subsequent legislation taxed the state-chartered banks’ paper currencies out of existence in favor of a single sovereign currency. 

The newest type of private money is now upon us—in the form of stablecoins like “Tether” and Facebook’s “Diem” (formerly “Libra”). Based on lessons learned from history, we argue that privately produced monies are not an effective medium of exchange because they are not always accepted at par and are subject to runs. We present proposals to address the systemic risks created by stablecoins, including regulating stablecoin issuers as banks and issuing a central bank digital currency.",finance
personalfinance,"I got a house under contract, but now I'm nervous I bit off more than I can chew.","I have 2 days to back out and get my earnest money back since we just had an inspection.

My take home pay is right at 6.1K per month. Paid twice a month, so always 6K.

I max out a 401k &amp; roth IRA, contribute 400/month to 2 529s, and 200/month to an HSA, all are auto deducted from my checks.

Here's my breakdown in monthly bills:

Car insurance: 130

Phones: 160

Groceries: 1000

Gas (car): 250

Lasik (0%): 170

Kids: 400

Internet: 60

Hbo max/netflix/game pass: 40

Total: 2420

Estimated bills from previous home owner:

Water: 100

Gas: 50

Electric: 100

Total: 250

Total bills: 2670

Both our cars are 2019 models and fully paid off, no concerns on maintenance there.

The house is in a really good neighborhood and the seller is relocating so we got a full list of disclosures. We also got it under ask price. It is 4040 sq ft and Total price was 640,000.  We are putting 10% down and buying down points to get to a 2.75% interest rate. The highest quote from home insurance and the highest estimate for tax assessed value combined with our principal and interest puts our monthly payment at 2850.

After closing &amp; paying a mover we will have 25-28K in savings left over.

We do get 550 a month for the rest of the year for the child tax credit, which we plan to put into savings.

The inspection turned up nothing major except that most of the appliances are end of life, except the AC unit.

Estimated HVAC replacement: 15K (1 year past end of life, still working properly)
Estimated roof replacement: 20K (we can wait 5 years or so on this, so not really worried since insurance will cover issues)
Estimated water heater replacement: 3K (2 years past end of life, still working properly)

Our realtor suggested a home warranty for the first 2 years (about 1K per year).  My wife is also a nursing student and has 2 years left before she graduates. She also has 17K in student loans. We are thinking that being able to afford things for 2 years is the goal. After that, her income will give us plenty of space.

Every bit that I make over our total bills will go to savings (about 300/month). We'd like to keep about 30k in savings for emergencies, so it'll take a bit to build that back up. If we get into a bind, I can free up 400 a month by not contributing to my kids 529s for a few months.


Edit, just spoke with realtor about backing out, she said because we are dealing with a relocation company we will probably have to get lawyers involved, and because the home inspection didn't turn up any necessary repairs we wouldn't get our earnest money back (6k).  So is it worth the attorney fees to get out of the house?",finance

Annual dividend increases were expected to continue per CFO 5/4/2021, 1st quarter conference call.


Decade-long conversion into a pure-play, science and innovation-focused company.


Transaction to combine Upjohn with Mylan to form Viatris in the fourth quarter 2020 completed. PFE now operates as a single focused innovative biopharmaceutical company engaged in the discovery, development, manufacturing, marketing, sales and distribution of biopharmaceutical products worldwide.
 

The emergence of new coronavirus variants, including the highly transmissible delta variant, could fuel increased and sustained demand for BNT162b2, Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine.


8% to 12% annual sales growth expected between 2021 and 2025 as new drugs offset generic competition.

PFE has 99 experimental drugs in clinical development, including 22 late-stage programs. 


Bought back nearly $9 billion of its own shares in 2019.


No share repurchases were made in 2020 and no shares have been repurchased through February 2021. As of February 2, 2021, Pfizer’s remaining share repurchase authorization is $5.3 billion. Current 2021 financial guidance does not reflect any share repurchases in 2021.


In 2020 Pfizer's sales popped 2% to $41.91 billion. That excluded the Upjohn unit, which Pfizer merged with Mylan to create Viatris (VTRS). The Upjohn business housed Pfizer's older drugs, including those facing generic competition. Negligible BNT162b2 sales in 2020. Decision to divest its off-patent division should result in faster growth. 


Strong cash flows generated from a basket of diverse drugs.
 

Large size confers significant competitive advantages in developing new drugs as well as economies of scale, strong R&amp;D capabilities.

Pfizer is now launching several potential blockbusters in cancer, heart disease, and immunology. cardiovascular drug Vyndaqel is a potential game-changer in the rare disease area.


Threats-

Facing pressure since President Joe Biden and U.S. Trade Representative Ambassador Katherine Tai voiced support for waiving the patent rights protecting Covid vaccines.

Concerns have also emerged that the Covid vaccines using messenger RNA technology could be tied to heart inflammation in people younger than age 30. Studies conducted on vaccines from Johnson &amp; Johnson and AstraZeneca show no link between these vaccines and similar heart conditions.

In January Pfizer stock tumbled close to 3% on a single day after the company said rheumatoid arthritis drug Xeljanz failed to outperform a rival medicine in a post-marketing study.

Covid-19 vaccines work too well.

Pharma legislation, competition, lawsuits - all the usual suspects.


Covid-19 -

PFE's COVID-19 vaccine, BNT162b2, uses messenger RNA technology or mRNA, which tells the body to make a single spike protein, mimicking the outside of the virus.

Has increased its guidance for BNT162b2 revenue to $26 billion from $15 billion and lifted its EPS guidance on May 4, 2021. 

Both Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech are negotiating new contracts and remain best positioned to develop the first vaccines against new variants. Moderna has released the first data for a third dose with its mRNA-1273.351 variant vaccine that imply stronger and more consistent protection across variants and Pfizer expects data from its own variant vaccine in July. Pfizer also noted that future variant vaccine updates may only need a lead time until regulatory authorization of roughly 100 days.

Pfizer is scaling up manufacturing to meet its commitment to deliver billion doses of its coronavirus vaccine by the end of 2021.

Expect COVID-19 vaccine sales will create very strong growth in 2021, but likely weigh on growth by 2023 as competitive vaccines erode pricing and demand for Pfizer's vaccine. 

Expect improved bottom line on increased annual revenue over the next three years as cost-cutting plans and share buybacks (currently paused) take shape.

BNT162b2 was granted an emergency use authorization (EUA) in the U.S. in December 2020.

Instead of mRNA, China’s leading vaccine makers, state-owned Sinopharm and private firm Sinovac, rely on inactivated vaccine technology and their effectiveness is poor especially against the Delta variant.  CCP sponsored unfounded concerns and negative reviews around mRNA. CCP vaccine diplomacy failing miserably as Chinese non-mRNA vaccines are maybe 50% effective.   

Variants of concern — 
Alpha - Britian - ~ twice as contagious as the original
Beta - South Africa
Gamma - Brazil
Delta - India - about 60 percent more contagious than Alpha

The FDA has said Pfizer can transport and store their BNT162b2 at more standard freezer temperatures.

Testing out a booster to the original vaccine. From a PFE financial perspective, they would benefit if booster doses are needed.

Effectiveness against Delta variant, the most contagious variant, seen at 64% in Isreal and about 71% almost everywhere else.

FDA 

Submitted applications for full approval vaccine (Biologic License Application) to the FDA on May 7, 2021.
Full approval expected within 6 months typically, so latest expected approval 11/7/2021, unsure now; FDA (7/15/2021) set January 2022 target to decide on approval of Pfizer's COVID-19 shot for those at leat 16 years old although noted highest priority and earlier possible.
Full approval allows their Covid vaccine to stay on the market after the pandemic ends and PFE could also market directly to consumers and change the vaccine's price.

On May 10, the FDA authorized the companies' Covid vaccine for emergency use in teens ages 12-15. European officials followed on May 28.

In September, Pfizer expects to have the test results of its Covid vaccine in children ages 2-5 and 5-11. It will then ask for emergency authorization for those groups. In November, the company expects to have data from tests in children age 6 months to 2 years.

The possible need for booster shots could further extend vaccine sales.

Per FDA, emergency authorization for Covid-19 vaccines in children under 12 could come in early to midwinter. The agency hopes to then move quickly to full approval of the vaccine for this age group.

7/13/2021
Meets with top U.S. health officials yesterday to discuss the authorization of a third dose of its COVID-19 vaccine. Biden’s chief medical adviser acknowledged that ""it is entirely conceivable, maybe likely” that booster shots will be needed.  Health officials need to see more data to know if additional shots could raise people's risk of serious side effect. The second dose for two-shot COVID-19 vaccine regimens was associated with higher rates of side effects.

PFE's booster study suggests people’s antibody levels jump five- to 10-fold after a third dose, compared to their second dose months earlier.

Currently only about 48% of the U.S. population is fully vaccinated.

7/12/2021
RBC Capital  increased the target price from $43 to $44 and reiterated a Hold rating.

In early July PFE disclosed it's developing a specific vaccine to tackle the Delta variant.  Hopes to start testing in August.

PFE is also testing a third dose of its vaccine as a booster shot.

In the Europen Union 77 million doses of Pfizer’s Comirnaty and 20 million doses of Moderna’s Spikevax vaccine had been administered as of May 31. 

Israel became the first country to offer boosters, authorising third doses of the BioNTech/Pfizer shot to adults with serious pre-existing medical conditions. Other countries are considering whether and when to follow suit.

Some expect that booster Covid shots will be necessary in the years to come as the virus continues to circulate, much like with influenza, for which annual revaccination is required.

Researchers are increasingly encouraged by breath tests that can detect Covid-19.

Pfizer said that it planned to ask the FDA for emergency approval for a third dose of its vaccine and that it was working on a shot that offered more protection against the Delta variant. PFE noted that vaccine efficacy MAY decline six months after immunization. Scientists were critical of the announcement, pointing to evidence that the current two-dose regimen is powerfully effective against the coronavirus. 
FDA and CDC responded that fully vaccinated people generally did not need boosters — yet.

7/7/2021
From May 15 to July 12, of the 29,380 COVID-19 cases reported in Ontario, 83.2 per cent had not been vaccinated at all and 15.6 per cent were partially vaccinated. About 1.2 per cent were fully vaccinated. 

United Kingdom is suffering another major coronavirus outbreak. There appear to be both outbreaks in clusters of people who are not vaccinated yet and also a significant number of breakthrough infections that got past the vaccine — though importantly, vaccination still seems to prevent almost all serious illness. The U.K. has mostly used the AstraZeneca vaccine, which is not as good as the Pfizer and Moderna versions used for most American inoculations.


7/6/2021
Brazil approved a new clinical trial of a COVID-19 vaccine candidate to be developed and tested by Sanofi Pasteur, the vaccination division of French pharmaceutical giant Sanofi. The phase 1/2 trial is also expected to take place in the United States, Honduras and Australia.

1st Quarter 2021 revenues of $14.6 billion, up 42%.
Adjusted diluted EPS of $0.93, beating the consensus estimate by $0.15 and rising 47%. 
GAAP net income was $4.877 billion or $0.86 per diluted share, compared to $3.355 billion or $0.60 per share.

COVID-19 vaccine sales are providing a major lift to sales and earnings in 2021 and likely into 2022.

Total sales increased 42% (up 8% excluding COVID-19 vaccine sales)

COVID-19 vaccine sales contributed $3.5 billion in the quarter and are guided to be almost $26 billion in 2021, above previous guidance of $15 billion and ahead of our $23 billion estimate. 

Top drugs Eliquis (cardiovascular),Vyndaqel (rare disease) and Xeljanz (immunology) all posted strong gains based on leading efficacy driving market share gains. 

Cancer drug Ibrance fell 1% as economic hardships (likely related to the pandemic) are increasing the need for Pfizer assistance programs, but this should reverse as the pandemic eases.
 
Pneumococcal vaccine Prevnar fell 57% in U.S. adults, where guidance against co-administration with COVID-19 vaccines pressured results, but a new co-administration study of nextgeneration Prevnar 20 with the COVID-19 vaccine (data later in 2021) should help reinvigorate the franchise.

Excluding Revenues for BNT162b2 of $3.5 billion, revenues grew 8% operationally including a negative 5% impact from pricing.

Raised full-year 2021 guidance for revenues to a range of $70.5 to $72.5 billion and adjusted diluted EPS to a range of $3.55 to $3.65, primarily reflecting updates to anticipated contributions from BNT162b2 partially offset by additional R&amp;D expenses for vaccines to protect against COVID-19 as well as other mRNA-based development programs and COVID-19 antivirals.

Now anticipates revenues of approximately $26 billion for BNT162b2, reflecting 1.6 billion doses expected to be delivered in 2021 under signed contracts as of mid-April 2021.

Enters into contracts to supply BNT162b2 to Canada and Israel for periods beyond 2021; ngotiating similar potential contracts with other countries.

Maintains quarterly dividend for second-quarter 2021 at $0.39/share; dividend will not be reduced as a result of the initiation of a quarterly dividend by Viatris Inc. 

2/2/2021 - 4th Quarter 2020 and Full Year 2020

Quotes from the earnings release -

In the fourth quarter, achieved double digit operational revenue growth driven by a wide range of products and geographies, including growth within all of our therapeutic areas.

Guidance -
The midpoint of the guidance range for revenues represents 44% growth from 2020 revenues, including an expected $1.4 billion, or 3%, favorable impact from changes in foreign exchange rates. The midpoint of the updated guidance range for Adjusted diluted EPS reflects a 42% increase over 2020 actual results, including an expected $0.09, or 4%, benefit due to favorable changes in foreign exchange rates.

Financial guidance for Adjusted diluted EPS is calculated using approximately 5.7 billion weighted average shares outstanding, and does not currently assume any share repurchases in 2021.

Revenues for BNT162b2 approximately $15 billion, contributed $154 million in sales in the fourth quarter.

The BNT162b2 revenue projection incorporated within Pfizer’s 2021 financial guidance primarily includes doses
that are expected to be delivered in 2021 under existing contracts, and may be adjusted in the future as additional
contracts are executed.

Guidance for BNT162b2 incorporates the current expectation for revenues for the product, less anticipated Adjusted costs to manufacture, market and distribute BNT162b2, including applicable royalty expenses and a 50% gross margin split with BioNTech, as well as shared R&amp;D expenses related to BNT162b2 and costs associated with other assets currently in development for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.

Diluted weighted-average shares outstanding was 5,662 million shares, an increase of 31 million shares compared to the prior-year quarter primarily due to shares issued for employee compensation programs.",finance

personalfinance,Should i sell my investment property?,"Good afternoon! I hope all of you that are reading this are having a wonderful day! :)

I currently own an investment property that is managed by a real estate agent. I make about $100 a month on it after fees, repairs, and taxes. That isn't much of course, but I'm not losing money and the home value has been skyrocketing. I currently owe 70k on it with a 15 year mortgage at 3.125% that matures in december of 2035.  I am paying an extra 100-150 each month in principle to pay it down early (believe it or not it is the highest interest rate on any debt I have.) The home is valued between 180k-200k at the moment.

I am 35 years old this month and am contemplating selling since home values are so high right now. The plan is to hold the funds in some sort of low risk, low cost investment (open to recommendations) until the housing market eventually goes back down. Then I would use this money to put a down payment on a new primary home or investment property.

Between my wife and I we make low 6 figures, which is pretty good in the area we live.

Am i missing anything? I haven't sold a house before so this is new territory for me.

Should I hold the home longer? I'm in no major rush to sell as I just refinanced and would prefer to break even.

Any recommendations would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you all for reading and replying! :)",finance
personalfinance,Inheritance - Pay Off Mortgage or Invest?,"Hi folks,


I recently received a large inheritance totaling over 200k. I plan to first pay off my credit card and car note, which is about 30k. For the remainder, I was thinking about putting around $50k into my mortgag to help pay it off sooner and reduce interest costs. My father told me that I should invest rather than pay off the house early. House has $260k owed on it, 29 years remaining on the mortgage, and a 3.5% interest rate. 
According to my math, if I paid $50k toward the mortgage, I will pay $70k less interest and pay off the loan 7.4 years early. 
If I invest $50k for 23 years at 6%, I should see ~$96k in gains over 23 years, with a 25% federal tax deduction included in that number. 

Questions:  how realistic is an average of 6% over 23 years?

Does my math seem correct?

Any advice or guidance?

If I am wrong about something, please correct me, I am always open to changing my mind. I am not an expert in any of the fields I am talking about, thus I will only talk about things in their most basic form. Please also bear in mind that English is not my mother tongue.

This post is made for educational content only, I hope you will learn something here that you did not before.

The world's largest ""democracy"" has almost always struggled with the finances, whether it is the utter failure of [demonetization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Indian_banknote_demonetisation) which essentially made your money instantly worthless overnight, or incredibly high interest rates from private moneylenders as well as banks for the farmers and other underprivileged. Banks screwing people over is pretty common.

The conditions of small-time farmers are pretty bad, the government has failed to show interest in improving their condition, a lot of people are undocumented and unbanked, but I could not find the solid numbers. Small landholders have to take loans at exorbitant rates, again I could not find the numbers but the Wikipedia article and some other sources say it can range from lower 30% to 60%. Not being able to pay off the debt causes these farmers to sell their crops at a significantly lower rates  than what they would actually go for in the market. Debt upon debt can lead to dire consequences 

This [report by Tata institute](https://web.archive.org/web/20130809074417/http://vnss-mission.gov.in/htmldocs/Farmers_suicide_TISS_report.pdf) cites various reasons why farmers commit suicide, this ranges from family responsibility, crop failure, debt and some lack of government interest. If you want the gist of the situation, I recommend this [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farmers%27_suicides_in_India). It more or less explains how bad the situation is, but it skips out on a lot.

There are moneylenders and landlords which are basically resorting to slavery for crop production. India, despite being an agrarian society has no infrastructure, transportation, cold storage and marketing, inefficiencies lead to significantly lower money going towards the farmers compared to other nations, that includes use of traditional practices for farming such as use of cattle for tilling the fields. 

The lack of transparency from the banks as well as government is something that should not be acceptable yet here we are, everything is getting more and more expensive here, the gas prices are more than ETH gas (I am sorry) despite being poor and majorly dependent on agriculture, India has failed its underprivileged time and again. This entire thing however is only a small part of a very big problem, and unfortunately it is not going away anytime soon.  I just find it funny that a lot of these problems can be solved with DeFi and only if people were to be educated about this. It is a double-edged sword however, it needs to be made more accessible and cheaper to use, as it stands it is far from ready to be widely adopted, but one can dream.",cryptocurrency

investing,3 Main Reasons Why to invest in gold..??,"It’s natural and even very important for an investor to check whether an investment in a particular asset is a good investment or not. More sensible in the case of true for gold. In India, people hold the gold for their future plans like marriage &amp; other cultural rituals, convert black money into physical gold or gold certificate, and other personal financial goals depending upon ambition.

As a being of entrepreneur/ service class person, 

Why would you invest in gold?
Use as a currency:
In the global market gold is the only currency that has completed around 3000 years in the global market. It has the longest currency track record as compared to other currencies. In the global market there other currencies are available which has more value as compared to gold. But if we compared the track record of gold vs other any currency, gold has more long-term holding value.

Keep in mind that gold always has some value &amp; you sell it when you need currency. That is the reason you need to add gold investment to your portfolio.

Inflation Hedge:
As we all know, inflation rises, the value of the currency goes down. Except for gold. In long run, almost all currencies depreciated over the period of time but the gold price increases. Also when inflation rates exceed the interest rate the saving instruments may not pay well, but gold pays the fare amount. This is how gold acts as an inflation hedge.

Keep in mind that, Gold has its own real rate of return.

No specialized Knowledge is Required:
Buying gold is way much straight forward. No training, equipment, tools &amp; tackles are needed to recognize the gold.  As nowadays we can buy gold in physical form or in digital form as per our storage &amp; security requirements.

Other Benefits like you can take the loan against gold, easily transferred to next-generation, a value never affected due to geopolitical tension, easily liquified in any shop, best replacement of stock &amp; real estate market investment and does not deteriorate with time,

Conclusion:

Make your financial profile more diversified. Because if inflation occurs, the value of your equity-based investment goes down but the value of gold arises dramatically.",finance

personalfinance,Dental Loan Refinancing Options for US Citizen Living in Canada and Working in US.,"My wife is an American citizen who completed dental school in Michigan and now works at a practice in Michigan after graduation. However, despite still working in the US, because she met me, she has since become a Canadian Permanent Resident who crosses from our home in Ontario to her office in Michigan every day.

Her dental loan was privatized to Laurel Road after graduation while she was living in the US and is still quiet significant (approximately USD $400,000).

Now, with the lower interest rates available, she qualifies for lower interest rates, but Laurel Road will not let her refinance since she cannot prove she has a US permanent address (she doesn't). We are not aware of any high value loans to replace this in Canada.

Does anyone have any suggestions?

We would love to take advantage of the lower interest rates while they are available, but we are hamstrung by the fact that no institution in Canada appears to provide them at that high a value, and no American institution (or at least Laurel Road) will approve her since she now lives in Canada. In fact, we can't find a way to refinance at all because of this.

stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Monday, July 19, 2021","**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, July 19, 2021**

The market sank today, with all three major indexes falling, the largest overall drop in at least two months. The market gapped down after the remarkable rally in mega-cap technology stocks, which had been driving the market higher, paused. It seems the market is being pressured by concerns surrounding inflation and rising concerns of a resurgence of coronavirus infections among the unvaccinated caused by the highly contagious delta variant. Q2 earnings season rolls on, with more big banks and industry-leaders like Johnson and Johnson (JNJ) and Netflix (NFLX) reporting this week. So far, earnings have been encouraging but have so far not impressed Wall Street. 

Since the release of the June Consumer and Producer Price Indexes (CPI &amp; PPI), which showed price inflation growing at a higher than expected clip, the market has become increasingly volatile, not unlike what happened in mid-May, where the SPY lost roughly 4% in two or three days. The CPI, which measures changes in the prices of consumer goods, rose 0.9% in June, accelerating from May’s 0.6%. Year-on-year, the CPI is up 5.4%, exceeding the 4.9% expected by economists and the fastest rate of growth since 2008. Core CPI, which excludes the volatile price energy and food and is therefore considered a more accurate representation of general price inflation, was up 4.5% year-on-year as prices bounced from last year’s pandemic-era lows. PPI, which measures the average changes in prices received by domestic producers for their output rose 1% in June, accelerating to a 7.3% rise year-on-year, while still reflecting base effects. Core PPI rose 5.5%. This is the fastest rate of increase since 2009. 

Concerns about the coronavirus delta variant are rising across the globe. Recently, Japan reinstated a state of emergency and banned all spectators from attending the Olympics, which are kicking off soon. In the US, despite roughly 50% of the population being vaccinated, in the past two weeks, infections across the country have roughly doubled, with cases jumping from 13,200 on July 4 to 32,300 on July 18, according to data compiled by John Hopkins University. In response, LA country reinstated its mask mandate, with other places in the US expected to follow suit. However, it is important to note that infections in the US are concentrated in areas with higher vaccine hesitancy. According to data from the CDC, 97% of people who have died or been hospitalized with COVID-19 since the vaccine became widely available are unvaccinated. Dr Rochelle Walensky, Director of CDC said of the rising cases, “There is a clear message that is coming through. This is becoming a pandemic of the unvaccinated. Our biggest concern is we are going to continue to see preventable cases, hospitalizations, and sadly deaths among the unvaccinated.”

It’s unclear how the situation will play out, I urge market participants not to panic just yet. While the rising cases are concerning and very unfortunate, on the positive side, the current vaccines have so far proven effective against the delta variant and countries around the world are quickly ramping up their vaccination efforts. But as always, one has to acknowledge the risks that are present in the market. 

Last week, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell gave his semi-annual monetary policy testimony before Congress, where he largely reiterated the same thing he has been saying for months. Powell said “inflation will likely remain elevated in the coming months before moderating” and that the US economy was “still a ways” off from reaching the threshold of “substantial further progress” that would trigger the Central Bank to roll-back pandemic-era policies. In short, Powell basically said while he expects higher inflation prints in the coming months, pressures are transitory and due to pandemic era disruptions and the Fed’s goal for economic recovery have not been met. [Here is Powell’s complete testimony, but here are two of his most important quotes.](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/testimony/powell20210714a.htm)

**On the labor market:** “Conditions in the labor market have continued to improve, but there is still a long way to go. Labor demand appears to be very strong; job openings are at a record high, hiring is robust, and many workers are leaving their current jobs to search for better ones. Indeed, employers added 1.7 million workers from April through June. However, the unemployment rate remained elevated in June at 5.9 percent, and this figure understates the shortfall in employment, particularly as participation in the labor market has not moved up from the low rates that have prevailed for most of the past year. Job gains should be strong in coming months as public health conditions continue to improve and as some of the other pandemic-related factors currently weighing them down diminish.”

**On inflation:** “Inflation has increased notably and will likely remain elevated in coming months before moderating. Inflation is being temporarily boosted by base effects, as the sharp pandemic-related price declines from last spring drop out of the 12-month calculation. In addition, strong demand in sectors where production bottlenecks or other supply constraints have limited production has led to especially rapid price increases for some goods and services, which should partially reverse as the effects of the bottlenecks unwind. Prices for services that were hard hit by the pandemic have also jumped in recent months as demand for these services has surged with the reopening of the economy”.

In other news, Q2 earnings season rolls on. As of today, roughly 8% of companies in the SPY have reported, with 85% of those beating expectations, according to FactSet. It seems like this quarter is shaping up to be another record-breaking season, with corporate earnings super-charged by rising demand from savings-laden consumers.

personalfinance,ARM vs. Fixed-Rate Mortagage,"Hi everyone. I have a question about mortgage structures. My wife and unfortunately need to purchase a house in the next six months. It's a pretty stringent timeline, we would have tried to deal with this months ago, but uncertainty in our current living situation didn't make that possible. 

Because of the crazy housing market, we thought it would be a good idea to buy a cheaper, shorter-term (5-year) house in hopes of saving money to build one day. As such, we have begun looking at mortgages and pre-approval and are considering a few options, but don't know which one works for our timeframe. 

Option 1: 20 year fixed rate mortgage- higher monthly payments compared to option two and a higher interest payment per month. 

Option 2: a 7yr/6m ARM (variable interest rate) mortgage. The interest rate and monthly payments are lower than the other options, and being able to lock-in the low interest rate for the 7-year is nice. 

I would like to have the equity-building opportunity of having the fixed rate mortgage, but want to take advantage of the lower interest of option 2. 

What are other things that I should consider?

TL;DR: Should I go with an ARM mortgage or a fixed-rate mortgage when I plan on moving from that house after 5-years of purchasing it? What other considerations should I be aware of?

Edit: thank you all for your input. I'm very new to the world of mortgages and appreciate all of your input in trying to find the best option. It seems the most popular option is the 30-year fixed rate mortgage.",finance

In the breakdown, there is an origination charge of $2800, which seems high, a recording fee of $445 which my realtor said is double what it should be, and most concerning, an ""additional charge"" of $5,269. There is no breakdown of what that additional charge actually is. 

My realtor's best guess is that it is a down payment, but the loan I have is a 0% down payment loan so that shouldn’t be charged as part of the closing. If it isn't a down payment I have no idea what that charge is. 

Can any of these fees be negotiated down? I of course will be asking my lender about what that $5,000 charge is first thing tomorrow.

Another question is about the interest. They have me at 4.5% interest, when I have an 800 credit score and zero debt. Why would that be so high? Is this something that can be negotiated as well?

Thanks for your help! I'm a first time homebuyer, so this is all extremely daunting and panic inducing.

**Edit:** [Closing cost breakdown](https://imgur.com/a/aWPJ0qG)

**UPDATE:** thanks everyone for your feedback and advice. Consensus seems to be that this isn’t a good loan, and that Navy Federal isn’t the best for mortgages. I reached out to another lender I had previously gotten a preapproval from, and he has gotten me a conventional 3% down loan with a 3.4% interest rate, and MUCH more reasonable closing costs. I won’t need to finance anything. This lender is also highly responsive and local, which Navy Federal has not been. I feel much better about this!",finance

personalfinance,Salary to Contractor,"Just want to know if I am getting screwed…or just your opinions. 

I am from WA and work for a company in WA. I had to move to another state, but I remained at the company by working remotely. Because of this move, the company changed me from a salary employee to a contractor. They said it was for tax purposes with the reason being WA doesn’t have state income tax and the state I’m in does. I guess they would have to pay stay income tax if they have out of state employees?

Anyways, my company increased my salary by 30% to compensate for federal taxes and insurances that I would now have to pay out of pocket for.  I also only get 10 paid days off a year while being at the company for 10+ years. 

I don’t get any other benefits - no vacation days (apart from the 10 paid days), no 401k matching, no profit sharing, no insurance, etc…

I love the job, but am I getting royally screwed by the company?  Curious to hear your opinions and curious to hear about the tax situation between a WA company that has out of state employees.",finance

CryptoCurrency,The APY comparison between POS coins doesn't matter.,"Disclosure: I own several POS projects that pay APY.

Most all of the serious crypto projects today are all inflationary (ETH may soon become an exception but not currently).  This inflation is nearly always deterministic and controlled (not the same as government fiat inflation).  

Inflation always transfers some of the value of the existing coins to the newly minted coins.  

POW (BTC) value transfer from hodlers to miners as all new coins are paid to block producers.

POS where coins must be staked (Cosmos, Tezos)  these coins only pay interest if the hodler takes extra steps to stake - in this case there is a value transfer from those who don't stake to those who do.  The higher interest rate is meaningful and affects the rate of value transfer.  The relative value of the interest payments are inversely proportional to the number of coins staked (at 100% participation no one is gaining value by staking - they are managing not to lose any value by staking so it is still an optimal decision).

POS where everyone is paid interest (ALGO).  Everyone is paid ~6%  no value transfer occurs in this scenario, while their may be a legitimate reason to do it (in ALGOs case they are trying to distribute the circulating coins fairly) the 6% you are paid results in a slight decrease in the value of each coin directly offset by the value of new coins received.",cryptocurrency
solar,SoCal - Feedback on EnergySage Quotes,"Looking to go solar within the next few months. We originally received a quote from LGCY that was **really** high (over $4.50/watt) and I found out about EnergySage through reddit. We're probably looking at around a 6 kW system, which should give us a bit more than we need right now.

All four of these quotes are pretty similar to each other, with minor variations. What do you think? Is the hardware fine? Anything that should be requested or avoided?

personalfinance,Refinance checklist,"So my current 15year fixed loan is 3.3%.  Looking online it seems like I can get rates as low as 1.93% for the same duration.  Seems like I should just pick the bank that offers the lowest interest rate + closing cost combination?  

Is there anything else I should be watching out for?  Based on nerd wallet, it seems like ""Reali Loans"" and ""Watermark Home Loans"" offers the lowest  interest + closing cost combo.  Are there any pitfalls I should look for and avoid?   

Also, on a related note, what's the easiest way to figure out if a loan has prepayment penalty without getting an attorney involved?",finance
personalfinance,Refinance investment property to pay down primary mortgage,"Has anyone done a cash out refinance on an investment property and used the cash to pay down your primary house?  I have a single investment property and as the mortgage has been paid down I’m getting less interest deduction and paying more in taxes as a result.  Other than a larger combined mortgage payment, are there any downsides to doing this?  I’m assuming I could get a rate on the property that, net of taxes is lower than the 3% on my primary and maybe pay down $100k+ of the primary house would save me some money.  Would the refi cost make it not worthwhile?

Investment property: 275k value, 60k remaining at 4.25% and around 10 years left.  Property is cash flow positive about $600/month.  Thinking of around a 210k 15 year mortgage.

Primary house: 280k left, 3% and around 19 years.

I take the standard deduction since the recent tax changes.  Likely 22% max federal and 7% state rates so I figure savings of around $2k/year.",finance
personalfinance,Is it better to sell old home and buy a new home or rent out and refinance given current housing market?,"I bought a house in Central Delaware but after switching jobs in the beginning of 2021, I’m living rent-free back with my parents in Central New Jersey (yes it exists). I’m certain I could sell my house because the housing market is good and I have made a few upgrades (not expensive since my dad does construction). Also, I’ve been getting pressure from my mom about me moving out and buying a condo for long-winded family reasons I won’t discuss here.

I was set on selling my place, but then an old co-worker hit me up and now I’ve got a potential tenant to rent the whole house for his family and I can leave my house furnished for them. There aren’t many rentals in my area and in the surrounding areas it looks like it’s around $1600+ for comparable rentals. I think I could reasonably charge $1500/month and I don’t mind heading down to Delaware after work to fix up things if needed. I know I pay taxes on my rental income and I figure I’d have to get landlord insurance (not sure how much) and pay upfront lawyer costs ($50-200) to generate a lease. But overall, it seems ideal to rent it out. I keep my house, get passive income (minus random landlord expenses), might not need to move my furniture, and my house is projected to go up in value next year as the town is still “up and coming”.

Here are the financial specifics to factor in:

* Bought a 3bed, 2bath townhouse at \~$190k in New Castle County, Delaware at the end of 2018
   * Zillow estimate says it’s worth \~$250k and I see a comparable home on sale right now for \~$240k
   * Chase estimates $196k
* Took out a 15-year mortgage with an interest rate of 4.625% and no PMI
   * Mortgage has been \~$1200 and I’m paying an extra $300 towards principal every month
      * I have about $125k left on my principal
   * (Just a quote from Chase) My refinanced 15-year fixed mortgage payment would be $825/month with 2.7% APR and $2500 closing cost
      * Or 10-year fixed mortgage at $1250/month with 2.5%
* Earn \~$4.3k a month after taxes and benefit deductions
* Property tax is almost negligible in Delaware as is other upkeep
* I'm projecting I could charge $1500/month for rent (tenant pays utilities)
   * Comparable rentals are $1600+/month
* Open to landlording or paying a management company in case I do leave the nearby area
* Unsure how long I want to stay in NJ because of career aspirations
* Mom is pressuring me to move out and keeps telling me I won’t be losing money if I buy a condo/house now in Central NJ
   * I don't think it's a good time to buy
   * Moving out and renting an apartment in NJ is \~$900+/month

It may be reductionist but I’m generically thinking “buy low, sell high”. Selling seems like a great idea but buying another place doesn’t right now. Condos and townhouses are selling fast in Central/South Jersey for \~$200k+ for a 2bed, 2bath and about 25% less total square footage. It’s a different housing market but I’m not a fan of effectively trading down. But renting in New Jersey isn’t that palatable either as it’s conceptually burning money since it’s not going into an asset, right? Also, I’m not sure how long I plan to stick around in New Jersey because of career goals (probably less than 2 more years).

1. Should I sell my house while it’s a sellers market and profit? Or should I rent it out and refinance mortgage?
2. Should I rent a place in New Jersey if I have to move out of my parent’s or should I just buy a place?

I would greatly appreciate your opinions or analysis. Also, let me know if there is any other information I should be considering. Thank you in advance!",finance

I could take a 4500$ loan at 2.75 and it would definitely help with housing costs for the year and I think it would eliminate a good amount of stress. My main idea is that with our current inflationary pressures (I know it’s source is argued about a lot but you can’t deny the current inflation.) I think inflation will out pace or keep close pace with 2.75% as the fed is currently targeting 2% over time. This is quite cheap debt and for an investment in myself. I am now leaning towards taking on the 4500$ for the year even though it goes against my main goal of taking no student debt. Any advice on the subject would be appreciated.,finance

4. Professor Aggelos Kiayias recently dropped a video explaining exactly how Mithril (apparently neckbeard dungeon master talk for elf armor) is going to allow for Perfect Cardano (ADA) wallets that combine the ease of use and convenience of light wallets with the trustlessness of full node wallets. We also learned exactly how Mithril is going to work. [https://youtu.be/LhepJFCyWRk](https://youtu.be/LhepJFCyWRk)
5. In proof-of-work, bootstrapping can be done with blockheaders. This won’t do in proof-of-stake since we need information about stakeholder distribution to confirm block validity.
6. Mithril fixes this by being a cryptographic construction that enables a population of stakeholders to issue a signature consistent with certain constraints.
7. For Mithril to work in proof-of-stake, it needs three crucial properties: 1) it needs to enforce a threshold ratio of stakeholders before the signature is issued; 2) the pre-signature fragments must be independently verified and subject to public aggregation; and 3) it must be efficient in the sense that the final signature is of constant size and is logarithmically dependent on the # of stakeholders.
8. Stakeholders will issue special Mithril keys along with the normal cryptographic key material. Then at regular intervals, full nodes will test whether they can produce a pre-signature fragment. Only a random subset of stakeholders will be eligible to produce a pre-signature fragment. When a sufficient # of pre-signature fragments have been issued by eligible stakeholders then it will be possible to aggregate the fragments into a final signature.
9. This will be a checkpoint that will be verifiable with respect to previous check points all the way back to the genesis block. Such checkpoints will be cryptographic commitments of the relevant UTXOs.
10. Since the checkpoints will be trustless, a light client (i.e. wallet) will only need to verify the sequence of checkpoints up to the current time to trustlessly bootstrap.

30. Minswap gives us the dev perspective on why Cardano’s Plutus is such an improvement over Ethereum’s Solidity. [https://twitter.com/MinswapDEX/status/1403411522110427137](https://twitter.com/MinswapDEX/status/1403411522110427137)
31. Here’s a great ETH vs. Cardano DeFi project comparison infographic. [https://twitter.com/Coin98Analytics/status/1403397242707320835](https://twitter.com/Coin98Analytics/status/1403397242707320835)
32. The Marlowe Webinar with Shruti is now available on youtube. Very interesting discussion of DeFi in general and also specific topics like “deep interoperability” in DeFi. Cardano is obviously already doing the very involved thinking about the future of DeFi. [https://youtu.be/vzsUSG5CSj0](https://youtu.be/vzsUSG5CSj0)
33. John O’Connor recently tweeted about a day where he “wrote a letter to a president” and “found a million users to bring into Cardano”. Sounds like the Cardano train is rolling along as smoothly as ever in Africa. [https://twitter.com/jjtoconnor/status/1402565547716399104](https://twitter.com/jjtoconnor/status/1402565547716399104)
34. Zach Guzman and Mike Novogratz get an opportunity to prove once again how extremely threatened they are by the fact that they can’t frontrun Cardano at this point. [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1404100510525841408](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1404100510525841408)
35. John O’Connor appeared on the Disrupt Network Podcast. [bit.ly/3znqyB7](https://t.co/26advBvFku?amp=1)
36. President of Tanzania calls on the central bank to prepare for the adoption of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. I wonder what crypto ecosystem already has experience working with an African government on a big crypto project and has partnered with a mobile company that is already bringing connectivity to rural Tanzania? [https://twitter.com/DocumentingBTC/status/1404126444863766533](https://twitter.com/DocumentingBTC/status/1404126444863766533)
37. Hedgefund Billionaire Paul Tudor Jones tells the world to buy crypto and certain other assets if the Fed doesn’t address inflation in their policy meeting that concludes on Wednesday. JP Morgan’s Jamie Dimon concurs that the current inflation is very likely not transitory. This could be tremendously good timing for Cardano given our top five status and the impending mainnet launch of smart contracts.

38. With exploits like this one being all too common in the legacy smart contract networks, we’re not even going to have sell the Cardano use case for DeFi. The competitor networks have already made the case that something better must be on the way. [https://twitter.com/zapper\_fi/status/1404429179794362369](https://twitter.com/zapper_fi/status/1404429179794362369)

41. While renewable energy is certainly a wonderful thing, there may be a problem with your technology when your path to compete on clean energy consumption involves you talking about harnessing the power of a whole series of volcanoes. Maybe just use fewer volcano’s and more proof-of-stake? [https://twitter.com/\_eLaPs\_/status/1404125569093029889](https://twitter.com/_eLaPs_/status/1404125569093029889) [https://twitter.com/gladstein/status/1402718041557725184](https://twitter.com/gladstein/status/1402718041557725184)
42. The Charles/Lex Fridman podcast has dropped. This is a big deal. This is a fairly mainstream podcast with over 1 million subscribers. [https://youtu.be/FKh8hjJNhWc](https://youtu.be/FKh8hjJNhWc)
43. Politicians in the legislative branches of Panama and Paraguay have now announced intentions to introduce crypto-related bills into their respective legislative assemblies.

45. The bank of England is getting very serious about how it “may wish to limit migration” of money from the legacy system to stablecoins. Wow. Just another example of why it’s such an asset (no pun intended) that Cardano is prepared for regulation. [https://twitter.com/CaitlinLong\_/status/1405712468823842816](https://twitter.com/CaitlinLong_/status/1405712468823842816)

49. It’s a good sign that the top two crypto communities are spending so much time talking negatively about Cardano. You only focus your hatred on that which is most threatening. I’m glad to see we’re the biggest threat on their radar. [https://twitter.com/nic\_\_carter/status/1405194146063736840](https://twitter.com/nic__carter/status/1405194146063736840)
50. Bloomberg just published a piece called “America Should Become a Nation of Renters”. While this statement is probably extremely polarizing for Americans, it can also be argued that the death of homes as the primary investment vehicle of Americans may open up a new wave of adoption in crypto as an alternative. [https://twitter.com/bopinion/status/1405609396302979074](https://twitter.com/bopinion/status/1405609396302979074)

52. All 345,501 of the people who have watched the Lex Fridman/Charles episode as of writing are realizing that Cardano could be the first project to put voting on the blockchain in a U.S. state. [https://www.atalaprism.io/app](https://www.atalaprism.io/app)
53. Days like today in Cardano and the greater crypto space always reminds me that there have been other great adoption stories that went through periods like this.[https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1407077949774442499](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1407077949774442499)
54. It looks like the second biggest ETH stakepool or it's custody provider has lost it’s users private keys to $75MM in ETH. Cardano doesn’t have this problem. We get to keep custody of our crypto because we found a better way than slashing. [https://stakehound.com/blog-post/fireblocks-eth-2-key-management-incident/](https://stakehound.com/blog-post/fireblocks-eth-2-key-management-incident/) [https://twitter.com/JamesSpediacci/status/1407465311180255236](https://twitter.com/JamesSpediacci/status/1407465311180255236)

57. The June Cardano 360 is currently available on Youtube. [https://youtu.be/al5m14299ww](https://youtu.be/al5m14299ww)
58. We saw segments on various newer partner entities like Nervos, Orion Protocol, and Revuto. Nervos is a UTXO proof-of-work blockchain which is building a cross-chain bridge with Cardano so that you can use your ADA on Nervos dApps and vice versa. Interoperability is a big theme for Nervos and they plan to have a working testnet within a month. Orion Protocol is building a terminal that will allow for decentralized non-custodial trading across centralized and decentralized exchanges. They say this would not require you to KYC or even have an account with any of these exchanges. Revuto is an online subscription management service that recently completed a $10MM token sale on Cardano.
59. It was also revealed that Wolfram Labs, COTI, and IOHK have a three-way partnership (a ménage à tech) to build an NFT auction site. The people from Wolfram were talking about very interesting things including live minting during streaming events and automated upload to IPFS. COTI will be building out auction and bidding mechanisms in ADAPay.
60. Professor Aggelos Kiayias gave us an update on research including that Ouroboros Chronos and Hydra papers have both been accepted into conferences/journals. Chronos will provide Cardano with a global concept of time that doesn’t rely on any outside timekeeper. Prof. Kiayias also pointed out that Hydra is distinguishable from other layer two protocols in that the scripting language is identical to that of the base layer in Cardano such that any dApp that can run on Cardano will run on the Hydra L2. This is a huge plus and superior to many other layer two solutions in other ecosystems where the base layer dApps will not run on layer two. Finally, the Mithril paper has been submitted for peer review. It will provide Cardano light wallets with Succinct Non-interactive Arguments of Knowledge that will give us the best of both worlds: no delays for syncing as in full node wallets while still preserving trustlessness.
61. Finally, the Goguen Summit will be in late September. Sign up now at [summit.cardano.org](http://summit.cardano.org/).
62. The Fed is once again STRONGLY signalling to us that they are going to regulate stablecoins. The Fed is also specifically calling out Tether for the first time. You need to be thinking about how stablecoin regulation might affect your favorite Cardano DeFi or other project. [https://twitter.com/CaitlinLong\_/status/1408500265397985282](https://twitter.com/CaitlinLong_/status/1408500265397985282) [https://twitter.com/CaitlinLong\_/status/1408572624125534212](https://twitter.com/CaitlinLong_/status/1408572624125534212)
63. People are starting to realize that the Stakehound private key loss in ETH may attract unwanted regulatory attention to Ethereum 2.0 while this problem could never have occurred in Cardano. Also, only a few days later another ETH stakepool (this time SharedStake...the sixth biggest ETH Stakepool) allegedly experiences a rugpull that some are valuing at over $30MM. This is another problem that could not happen in Cardano staking. It feels like we stepped into the ring, they rang the bell, and ETH just started punching itself in the head. Eventually it’s going to KO itself.

64. Here’s another great Cardano data site. This one is from the Cardano Fans stakepool. [https://datastudio.google.com/u/0/reporting/3136c55b-635e-4f46-8e4b-b8ab54f2d460/page/r2LQC](https://datastudio.google.com/u/0/reporting/3136c55b-635e-4f46-8e4b-b8ab54f2d460/page/r2LQC)
65. John O’Connor of IOHK points out that France still controls the monetary policy of 14 countries in Africa. There is definitely a built in market on the continent for a project that delivers monetary sovereignty to the people.

76. Cardano is now a small part of Grayscale’s Digital Large Cap Fund. They actually sold off current holdings in other coins to buy ADA. This is big for institutional adoption! [https://twitter.com/Grayscale/status/1410945118228692994](https://twitter.com/Grayscale/status/1410945118228692994)

79. Robert Kornacki of dcSpark releases an article on why every Cardano dApp will use NFTs. The article contains some very interesting discussion on smart contracts in the EUTXO context including language instructing that “UTXOs have smart contracts attached to them and not the other way around” and “\[...\]the simplest way to think about it is that when a UTXO is created it has the option to have a smart contract attached to it.” [https://medium.com/dcspark/every-eutxo-dapp-will-use-nfts-and-heres-why-fd87e6a8c9a6](https://medium.com/dcspark/every-eutxo-dapp-will-use-nfts-and-heres-why-fd87e6a8c9a6)

99. There is a new stakepool explorer available. [https://www.cardanoworld.io/](https://www.cardanoworld.io/)
100. Very interesting timing with a) Grayscale Buying $50MM ETCG, b) Grayscale adding ADA, and c) Charles joining the ETC Cooperative board given that two of the members of the ETC Cooperative board seem to come from Grayscale and DCG. Maybe the world is starting to understand just what Charles and IOHK have been able to accomplish over the last few years.

101. There is a new Cardano wallet being introduced by [u/berry\_ales](https://www.reddit.com/u/berry_ales/) from the Berry Pool. I have no idea if it will be good or bad at protecting your ADA. Just reporting that it exists. [https://twitter.com/berry\_ales/status/1414548062207361025](https://twitter.com/berry_ales/status/1414548062207361025)

Just days before he is scheduled to remit office, the NJ AG  Gurbir S Grewal has issued a cease and desist order against BlockFi warning them to stop services in NJ and halt new signups.

While this  news taken alone can be considered as a state policy, the larger picture is that  Gurbir S Grewal has already been appointed as the head of [SEC's Enforcement Division](https://www.indiatoday.in/world/indians-abroad/story/indian-american-gurbir-grewal-us-securities-exchange-commission-1821390-2021-07-01).

His own quote:

&gt; The Enforcement Division has a critical role to play in finding and punishing violations of the law,"" said Gurbir S Grewal. ""I'm excited to get to work with the talented team of public servants to uncover and prosecute misconduct and protect investors

From a state role, he moves into a federal role prosecuting violations of law. I think this is not a good development for crypto at all.

stocks,Please do not assume that a price entered yesterday or in the morning will work again the same way,"Good morning everyone. I figured this was actually an important topic 

This is very important because it even kind of happened to me on Monday. On Thursday my last entry on NYCB was 11.10. I was trading this a few times from 11.10-11.40.... just this friday.... Monday morning it opened under 11... I felt hey my last sale was 11.30... let me just comfortably set a bid to buy at 11..... it fell to 10.78... I didnt check the level 2's or the charts that also will would have shown selling pressure, instead I used the fact that I was trading it Thursday and sold at 11.30! In my defense, it isnt much of a defense, but I work full time and I trade on my phone. I do not recommend it, however we do the best we can with what we have.

Each day is different, even several hours is different. Interest rates, earnings reports can change things. Also, in general from 12-2PM eastern time is a slow down time. Alot of big banks and firms which account for 80% of trading go out for lunch and stocks that are supported by them may come off a little and you can get a deal! However, the biggest movement is still... 9:30AM-9:45AM and 3:45PM-4PM......

If you made a trade at 10AM... then you can safely make it probably to 12 by copying the same order but after that it is very important to see if there is still the same support via Level 2's, or by graphics the chart.... Trading is in my blood now, it courses thru my veins so without looking at a chart I can actually draw it with candle sticks, RSI, DMI curves based on movement and volume.... however I can not tell Level 2s. So the most important thing for day trading is level 2s!!! Level 2 is 90% and chart is 10%... Over time you will already know what the chart will look like by the stock movement. Yes, it will take time but thats 2nd nature.

The past few days we have tried to enter the same orders on NLS and LAKE... I am trading on phones but I can tell you when the volume builds on NLS, the Level 2s show tremendous buying support in order to drive this from 6.30 to 6.90. It had to have 2-5x more buyers than sellers.....

So in short do not assume that a price/order that was entered yesterday should work for today. Even a trade in the AM may not work in the PM.

If you are doing swing trading, this may make sense..... if you are long term, try not to watch intraday quotes it will drive you crazy!!!",finance

CryptoCurrency,I might get liquidated for a loan that I'll be able to close in 2 days once I get my salary!,"Let me begin by saying that I am an investor and not a trader. So when I talk about liquidation and leverage I am talking about crypto loans and not margin trading.

So here's the story. I personally needed some money for personal expenses (not necessarily an emergency) but dd not want to sell my positions away. That is when I came across the lending platform [coinrabbit.io](https://coinrabbit.io/) which provides instant loans without KYC (I am not affiliated with them in any way and am just a customer). This seemed like a good way to profit from some gains without cashing out. I put my Nano as collateral and received the loan amount in 5 mins.

Unfortunately for me, they have a one month penalty (if you close your loan within one month of availing, you'll have to pay an extra fee). So I decided to pay off the loan after 32 days (which would help me avoid the extra fee).

I had not expected the crypto market to drop today and I am two days away from the 32 day limit when I was planning on closing my loan. Fortunately as I am new to taking crypto loans **I only put at risk what I could afford to lose**. Furthermore, I have a lot of spare nano on the side so I increased my deposit amount which saved me from getting liquidated (for now). Just for some context, in the morning a 5% drop in Nano price would have gotten me liquidated. Fortunately now I have 2 days and it would take a 33% drop in price for the same liquidation to happen (based on market sentiment this can still happen).

**Based on my experience with crypto loans, here are the main precautionary insights I can share**:

1. **Make sure the platform you are using is reliable** and not a rug pull. With new platforms starting everyday it is very hard to judge whether your money is parked in a safe place or not. I had heard good things about coinrabbit and they claim no rehypothecation so that gave me some peace of mind.
2. Make sure the crypto asset you choose as collateral is reliable enough. The incentive to choose Nano was instant loan release because of Nano's speed and fee-less nature. **I made a mistake by choosing Nano as collateral**. Because of its low market cap it is highly volatile. Even bitcoin is unreliable in a bear market.
3. **Taking a loan out on your crypto essentially means you are trying to time the market.** This is because you are hoping the prices don't drop enough in the short term to get you in a vulnerable position. This is definitely a high risk play with limited upside.
4. **Don't take a crypto loan to buy more crypto.** If you take out a loan to buy crypto, you are essentially exposing yourself to the risks of a margin trader. Everything follows BTC and ETH anyway so you are doubling your risks if you buy crypto with your loan amount.
5. Take measures to prevent liquidation. Some common ways to do it would be to **not take a loan on your entire crypto asset and instead save 50% or more in case of a severe price drop**. Depositing more coins later would drop the liquidation price and keep you afloat for a few more days at least.
6. **Have a strong source of income that you can use to pay off the loan** according to the timelines comfortable to you. Make sure you realise that if you are unable to pay off your loan then your collateral is stuck forever and the interest would keep piling up. Just like a credit card loan. 
7. Worst case scenario, **you get liquidated or are unable to pay off the loan. How would your life change?** This is the most important question to answer even before thinking about taking a loan based on your risk appetite and general financial condition. If getting liquidated would put you on the streets or if you are putting years of life savings as collateral, then maybe you need to rethink this and concentrate on the worst case scenario.

**Tldr;** Crypto loans still have a long way to go because of the volatility of the market and high correlation to BTC. Think carefully before taking one. It is very different from taking mortgage on your real estate property. In the future, we might start seeing less interest rates and more stability which would make this viable for everyone.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Does loan term matter?,"I have what may be a simple question but be patient with me, I am still learning the ends and outs of credit/finance.

So I currently have a 2016 Mercedes E400. I brought the car last year for $21,000 with less than 40k miles on it, it was a great deal. (fresh off a lease, all mercedes work done, literal only reason it sat on the lot was because COVID made the market sit because so many people lost their jobs). My original loan was at a 10% interest rate because my credit history was shaky. 

My credit is much better now and I am able to refinance at around 4.1-4.5% depending on term (60 or 72 months, respectively). The former will take my car payment from $414 a month to $376.50, the latter will take it to $323.70. My car is worth around $4-$6k more than what I owe on it currently (somewhere around $19,700). 

My question is, for refinancing, does the term of my loan really matter if I plan on selling the car in 2-3 years? would it be smarter to take the longer term since I have positive equity, don’t really plan on paying it off and owning it? (72/mo) or should I stick to the term that is closest to my current (60/mo)?

Owning a Mercedes past 80k is not something I want to do and I haven’t put many miles on it since I got it (average 12,000 a year, possibly a little less honestly)
The extra $80-$90 would help in extra money, but luckily i’m blessed to not necessarily NEED the extra reduction. I only really refinanced for the better rate to be real.

Please let me know what you think would be a smart decision, my last car I was crazy upside down on and don’t want that to happen again.",finance

I'm basically a money-in-a-shoebox-under-the-bed kind of guy.  Investmentsm credit and finance have always turned me off and I've lived comfortably as an outsider. I made it through undergraduate and medical school on scholarships.

personalfinance,Getting a grasp on finances late in life and trying to make the best decisions.,"A little background is I was a heroin addict for a good chunk of my life for over 15 years which left me in my very late 30's with nothing and terrible credit. 

Now clean for over 6 years I have just been working wherever I can with my record which has basically been pretty terrible jobs. I recently got a job with some benefits and want to make sure I am doing this right as I am ignorant to all of this.

So employer matches up to 4% on 401k so I did the 4%. It says my holdings are VANGUARD TARGET 2050 100.00%. Is that something that I want to change or should I just leave it as is? Is 4% realistic in making any real progress in 15-20 years? I could bump it up after reading about my next benefit.

Another benefit is a direct stock purchase to Amazon stock. So they take however much I want out of each check and put it towards amazon stock without any fee's involved. The thing is I am starting to wonder if its the best idea. I was thinking of it as a better than regular savings account but I am thinking maybe the money is better spent elsewhere, perhaps the 401k? 

Since I was nervous about the direct stock purchase plan I decided to only do $20 a week to test the waters. I planned on upping it and forgetting about it. Thing is for every $20 I put in the last month it is now worth $19.68. This makes it seem worse than a savings account. I just am not sure if I should be taking advantage of this or not. Reading step 4 in the sub wiki 'Contributing to an IRA' is a bit confusing to me but I could easily research it if that is a better option. In my feeble attempts I believed that the no fee's was something to consider on the employer DSPP.

Any information at all will be very much appreciated. I have no idea on how to get a grasp on my credit besides just trying to find outstanding debts and paying them. I have no credit card debit or other high interest rate stuff. It is just all unpaid bills that has made it so everything involving a credit check gets denied. 

Thank you in advanced if anyone takes the time to respond!


Edit: Some more about my debt. The largest I need to pay is about 3k to an insurance company. I also have $400 to the state. I think have about 1.5k in medical debt. Honestly it is hard to know and this has been a difficult thing. I just remember I owe a few under $500 dollar amounts from the early 2000's to a bank, telecommunication company, and cable bills. I honestly can not even remember the companies I just know I need to pay. 

When I first got clean I needed to pay 15k right away because of terrible choices from my addiction which I spent the first year and a half paying. Since then I just have not been able to work off any other debts until now and I honestly have trouble finding what I need to pay.

CryptoCurrency,"Stablecoin Risks &amp; Perks: Instant Settlement, Financial Contagion, Bank Runs, &amp; Other Important Concepts","Since most posts on this subreddit lately seem to be meta reactions to other posts on this subreddit, I thought now might be a good time share some information about stablecoins and the economic / market risks they entail.

Perhaps the biggest advantage that stablecoins have is their ""atomic settlement.""  This is the fancy, financial way of saying that the money arrives *immediately* and, more importantly, is available to be sent out again *immediately.*  Remember the last time you made a check deposit into a bank account? You had to wait a few days before you could spend the entire amount. You had to wait for the check to ""clear.""  Well, the benefit of stablecoins is that you don't have to wait.

Banks are extremely excited about this. It means that money doesn't have to spend as much time 'in limbo' between transactions. It means they can invest it immediately, borrow immediately, keep less cash on hand to cover settlement gaps (allowing them to invest more without increasing risk), etc... by using atomic settlement, banks stand to significantly increase both their profit and their stability. This is why the FED is excited about blockchain technology.

To understand why this is great for financial institutions, consider this: if all of the customers of robinhood, robinhood itself, and the GME clearinghouse all had atomic settlement, robinhoold wouldn't have been forced to halt trading on GME because robinhood never would've maxed out their credit line used for bridging the gap between when customers make deposits and when those deposits are finally available.  In short, with atomic settlement, robinhood wouldn't *need* a line at all for money to send to the clearinghouse to purchase the stock because all of the customer deposits would be available to them *instantly,* rather than a big chunk unavailable while waiting to finish clearing. They might've frozen it anyway, if you're inclined to believe the more conspiratorial views, but they wouldn't have been *forced* to due to lack of available funds to use for purchasing the stock for their clients.

Atomic settlement is great. So great, in fact, that its technology has led to the average stablecoin changing hands at approximately 20 to 50x the rate of a regular US dollar.  The economists out there refer to this as the ""velocity"" of the currency.  While this is great (to keep this post on-point, I'm going avoid discussing inflation) for the economy, it does present us with some new risks as well - the extreme velocity of stablecoins means that rare, outlier events can *happen faster* and with less warning.  Let's discuss what those might look like:

Right now, the collateral for stablecoins is held in a variety of places ranging from commercial paper (usdt / tether) to bank accounts (usdc / circle). The biggest concern that the government has with stablecoins is the possibility of financial contagion. Let me explain:

The vast majority of stable coins keep their pegs through the market making actions of the sponsoring companies. If USDC goes from $1 to $1.01 due to demand for USDC, Circle company will create new USDC, sell it in the markets (which brings the price back down to $1). They then take the actual US dollars that they sold it for and deposit that into bank accounts.

The issue isn’t when usdc goes above 1. The issue is when usdc goes below 1.

Yes, for every 1 usdc coin there is approximately $1 US dollar deposited in a bank account. But what if there is a run on USDC? Circle Corp has the collateral, so theoretically they can just keep withdrawing the $ US dollar from the bank and using that to buy and retire USDC, bringing the peg back up to $1. So what’s the problem?

The problem is that there is a metric shit ton of USDC out there. 26 billion, to be exact.

Now think about this not from usdc / circle’s perspective but rather from the perspective of the bank at which the collateral is deposited. Does that bank have *all* of that money on hand *all* of the time? No, of course not. They’re a bank, and unless they’re a special crypto-specific bank chartered in Wyoming, they are lending a good chunk of that money back out so that they can make money on the lending interest.

So imagine there’s a run on ethereum, which turns into a run on usdc. Circle is withdrawing from their bank deposits to buy usdc on the market and retire it. They’ve withdrawn (for example) a billion from the bank so far and have 25 billion left in deposits. But, unfortunately for them, the remaining funds aren’t available *at* the bank because the bank has leant out. *That's what banks do.* Circle, even though they have “deposits” at the bank, can no longer withdraw their deposits. The bank has to close for the day. It’s a bank run… which will then cascade into a run on another bank, and another, etc. stock market crashes, panic ensues.

Keep in mind that throughout this whole process, the bank is moving funds with a delay (regular settlement), whereas the need for funds is instant (atomic settlement).

The high velocity of stablecoins means that a run on them would happen much faster and with much less warning than a regular bank run.

If we apply this to tether, there is the possibility that significant selling of commercial paper could damage the ultra-short portion of the bond market… selling large amounts of commercial paper would certainly tank prices in the short term, however I think the bigger issue is that eventually the buy orders would all be filled and the market would lose all liquidity temporarily. Inventory (read: liquidity) is a much more limiting factor in the bond market than for the stock market, and as someone who trades bonds professionally I can tell you that things can dry up *much* faster, both on the sell side and the buy side. I don’t think this would have as disastrous spillover effects as the bank run, but it’d be a problem for any other entity looking to sell commercial paper at the same time. The bigger issue is that for tether holders, if there’s a run and the commercial paper is being sold, the value would temporarily drop below par, making tether undercollateralized. This is fundamentally different in cause from many of the conspiracy theories which inaccurately state that tether hasn’t been audited (it has, just not very thoroughly), but functionally the end result for tether users is the same.

This is what the fed is worried about. The size of Collateral deposits for stable coins and the velocity of said stablecoins has made some of them literally “too big to fail” because if they do fail then there’s a chance they’ll take everything down with them.

The solution? To *require* stablecoin companies to deposit stablecoin collateral into silo'd banks (silo = their deposits are held separately and are unavailable to borrow) or to only allow the collateral to be held in non-lending banks. Why would stablecoin companies not want to do this? Because then they wouldn't be earning any interest (remember that banks are only able to pay out interest because they make a profit on lending out the deposits).  The income the stablecoin companies receive would be significantly impacted - it would be limited to the income from their market-making activities (selling at 1.01, buying at .99, etc).  That's not bad, so don't feel too sorry for them, but it is a significant decrease.

* **Loan options:** I am eligible for Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loans at a rate of 5.28% (up to $20,500/year) and then Grad PLUS loans at 6.28% for anything above that. I have not explored private loans, but have strong credit and *may* be able to get my parents to co-sign if needed, although I'm hesitant to ask.

I filed my taxes this year with TurboTax and set them up to pull the money from my account on May 17th (federal filing date). However, I realized I made a mistake and needed to amend my tax return.

I forgot to stop TurboTax though so they withdrew the money as well and I currently paid the IRS 3 times more than I should.

Now, 8 weeks later, I have not been refunded the excess amount. I tried, for the last 4 weeks, to call the IRS multiple times a day and always get rejected from their automated system by saying they have too many people waiting on hold. I can't reach anyone to figure out when I will get my money back.

cybersecurity,How much should I be looking to make with my experience?,"I'm currently job searching and I was wondering what I should be asking for and realistically expecting to make with the amount of experience that I have and the current market I'm in. 

Background: I started in another field working for 7 total years and managing for 3 years with an industrial supplier. I worked in a tech/IT aspect but nothing too in depth (some networking, running cables, proprietary software management, user admin). Got fed up with the career prospects and decided to do IT as I thought I could be competent. I currently work as a cleared cyber analyst for the DoD in the Washington, DC area. I started out about 3 years ago by earning my Sec+ and then taking a job that didn't have anything to do with IT to get cleared. After about a year, I found my first helpdesk gig (senior role) with no experience and managed to pivot, after 4 months, into an analyst position that finally put me over 6 figures, which for me was an amazing achievement. I am still in my current role and it has been a little over a year. I also completed my masters program in Information assurance last year and managed to pass the CASP+ about a month ago. 

Now that I am searching for the next job that puts me closer to my end goal (consulting) I was wondering what range of compensation I should put as my minimum. I want to ask for fair value but what should that be? Taking area, experience and education into account, I thought $155k+ total compensation was reasonable. $65-70/hour with PTO and benefits basically. Does this seem high? Low? About right? I just don't want to feel underpaid as I was lowballed by my current recruiters in the position I am in now. $10-15k lowballed. Any input is appreciated.

personalfinance,Refinancing home -- Should I go 15yr or 20yr? Better to put more into my home to battle inflation?,"So we are 5 years into a 30yr loan , our interest rate is like 3.75%. Our monthly payment is about $2,055/mo.

We looked into refinancing and what they said was our two options are:

* 20yr term, 2.3% interest rate, $2,080/mo
* 15yr term, 1.8% interest rate, $2,430/mo

So the first option our payment goes up by like $25 a month, basically the same, but lose 5 years off our loan and about 1.5% less interest. Awesome deal.

The second option everything is even better, but we're paying about $350 more a month.

I've heard a lot of people say that a good leverage against inflation is putting more of your money into your mortgage, but I don't really understand why. We can afford the extra $350, but I would take that money out of some of the money I currently just use for investing in Index funds and long term savings..

So given those two options, what do you think is a better idea? Pay $2k a month and have +$350 to slap into VOO/VTI for long long term holding. OR put $2.4 into our mortgage and have a slightly lower interest rate but put $350 less money into long term savings? 

_additinal info_: we also have 401ks we put retirement money into from our companies, so it's not strictly coming out of our main ""retirement account"". Oh also we're 35 years old

personalfinance,Refinancing a Mortgage - am I getting screwed?,"I recently applied to refinance my home mortgage and after going through all the numbers I'm now confused about whether or not this is going to be the best financial decision, and whether I'm getting screwed on closing costs. I'm located in Texas if that changes anything.  


**Current Situation**  
I have a 30 year FHA loan on my house at 4.375%, I got the loan 5.5 years ago and I still owe $185k on it. The house is currently appraised at about $300k. The monthly payment is \~$1800/mo.  


**Refinance Details**  
Going through the same mortgage company that I have my current loan with, I have been offered a rate of 2.24% on a 15 year fixed conventional mortgage. After my escrow is applied to the principal the balance is $180k, however the closing costs are \~$10k plus $4.4k for discount points. This puts the loan amount for the new mortgage at $195k and some change. The monthly payment would go up to $1930, which isn't an issue.  


The most important factor is that my wife and I don't plan on staying in this house long-term - we're looking to move in 4-5 years so I'm hoping that refinancing will save us money within that time frame.  I just hate paying mortgage insurance and a high interest rate with rates as low as they are right now. So, even with what seems to be pretty steep additional costs to refinance, will this work out by the time we're ready to move?

solar,Virginia: Mission vs. LG,"Our home uses 10,818 kWh annually in Virginia. The installer has given two options:

**Mission Solar Panels (345W)** GT4.140MS, 4.140kW, 12 panels, $2.43/w, $10,050

**LG Solar Panels (345W1)** GT4.140LG, 4.140kW, 12 panels, $2.57/w, $10,650

or

**Mission Solar Panels (345W)** GT7.590MS, 7.590kW, 22 panels, $2.33/w, $17,700

**LG Solar Panels (345W1)** GT7.590LG, 7.590kW, 22 panels, $2.52/w, $19,150

&amp;#x200B;

So our payback period is 14 years, which would be reduced after the federal tax credit is applied. We're thinking of doing half this year, and then half next year. We'd probably go with the LG over the Mission, just based on the likelihood that LG will still be around in 25 years plus the longer warranty.

What questions should we be asking? Is splitting the cost over two years a good idea, or is it better to wait a year and do it all at one time next year?

The roof was reshingled earlier this year. During the reshingling a ridge vent was added, and that has helped a lot with cooler temperatures in the upstairs, reducing our usage. We are also shifting all lights bulbs over to LED. So we'll be using less electricity, which would actually make the breakeven point further away. We don't plan on moving before 15 years is up, which is right when we'll both be retired. Thanks for any thoughts you have on this project.",energy
CryptoCurrency,Would you invest in a coin that promotes homeownership? 🏡,"The vision:  A coin backed by a network of homes that people actually live in. After all, few things could be as tangible or as real as the home you live in. And real estate is one of the most stable asset classes, at the same time also keeping pace with inflation unlike fiat pegged stablecoins. So while this coin may not be stable in terms of its peg to fiat, it is more stable in terms of preserving purchasing power. Eg 1 coin = 1USD now but may be 2USD in the future, vs USDT which will still be 1USD. Just as importantly, it provides an alternative to fiat or gold.

The hope is that pegging it to real estate would mean that it keeps up with inflation and with lower volatility, could make it suitable for daily purchases and transactions. It might also lower the cost of borrowing which could make Defi more competitive with Cefi. Eg, with interest rates around 10% who would take out a home loan in crypto when fiat interest rates are 1-3%? Or just reduce the collateral needed.

A brief overview of how it would work is that the money raised for this coin would go towards a co-investment in people’s homes. The co-investment will be paid back when the homeowner sells their house or after a predetermined number of years eg 30 years. The money can then be used to co-invest in another home.

If you're wondering where the homes that back this coin would come from, here's where the idealistic part comes in.
The first group is renters, so many people are renting when they hope to own their own homes, instead of paying a landlord why not build up your home equity and wealth instead? The co-investment could fast forward their homeownership dreams by years by coming up with the down payment and other upfront costs.
The second group faces systemic discrimination such as women, racial and sexual minorities or even just singles who don’t benefit as much from governments’ family planning policies and subsidies. They typically take a long time to save up for a down payment if ever. A co-investment can be very empowering by making up for the shortfalls in the system immediately.
The third group is those who already have a home and may still be paying off their mortgage and want to tap into their home’s equity. Some may have run into financial difficulties, some want to cash out a portion of their homes. Instead of taking a home equity loan which results in more debt that you have to pay interest on, a co-investment gives a debt-free way to tap into their home equity.

I'm a 23 year old male that just graduated with a Bachelors in Criminal Justice. I hope to be a cop but I would like to wait a year or two to really see if that is something I'll actually want to do later in life.

With that in mind, I got some debt obviously. As of now, I'm about 40k in debt. I have been paying off Salliemae for the last 2 years while Edfinancial has yet to start payments but will now that I just graduated (about 4 weeks ago.) Both of those combined leaves me about 40k in debt. I have about 4k left to pay off for Salliemae while I owe Edfinacial a whopping 36k.

A few months ago I got promoted to manager at the ramen shop I work at and have been pulling stupid hours thanks to unemployment packages leaving me greatly understaffed (80 hour weeks for the past 2 and a half months.)

Fortunately for me, my job leaves me with no time to myself, which means at the very least I am getting good money and barley spending it. I only have 15k to my name as of now. No savings, nothing else. Just what's in my checkings (15k) and the debt I have. I currently live with my mom which she only asks for 450 a month to help out with rent. The only other thing i pay for is my phone bill which is 80 every 3 months. I am also considering moving out but i am hesitant to because i feel i do not have enough saved to be sitting comfortably considering the debt i have.

On average I am expecting to make 3.5k a month from my job. I have been able to pull in about 4.5k a month thanks to the crazy hours but that is subject to change once I get more employees. I get paid tips as well but just considering hours alone, 3.5k seems to be what I will normally be pulling in a month. 

&amp;#x200B;

So my question is, how should tackle the debt I have and also how to be more financial keen with what cards I currently have in my hand? I should also mention that I do not have a credit card. I dont like the idea of paying things off, unless its like school debt, which i have been paying off for the past two years. 

Quick recap

Checkings: 15k

Debt: 40k

No Savings

No credit card (how can i increase credit score? I am only paying off one thing but can i increase it faster by taking on more credit and paying it off?)

personalfinance,sudden UBTI tax liability in IRA and Roth IRA,"Hi everyone,

I am asking these questions on behalf of my mom's Rollover IRA and Roth IRA, both of which are at Vanguard. We are kind of panicking lol.

In 2017, we purchased stock in Foresight Energy (FELP), a coal MLP. It never generated any UBTI in those years....but it filed for Ch 11 bankruptcy in March 2020 and emerged on June 30th.

**Rollover IRA**

* Total Cost $67,508, Total Loss $67,508

**Roth IRA**

* Total Cost $83,490, Total Loss $83,490

Essentially, it was a total loss for us and the shares got liquidated on July 30th, 2020.

Now all of a sudden, Vanguard has issued 2 separate 990-T forms...one for the Rollover IRA and one for the Roth, claiming there is UBTI.

**Rollover IRA**

* UBTI $7,010
* Tax Due $1,348

**Roth IRA**

* UBTI $48,355
* Tax Due $16,594

Obviously, this is very concerning.

First, how can a company that never generated any UBTI while it was alive suddenly generate this after it died? Was restructured debt counted as income for prior shareholders? If so, that's totally effed.....when we lost the entire amount of our initial investment?

Second, the investments in both accounts were made on the exact same dates with the Roth account having $16,000 more in cost basis than the Rollover account ($83,490 vs. $67,508),  How can that lead to the Roth account owing $15,000 more in taxes? See below:

Rollover IRA: 11,026 shares, basis $67,508, 100% loss

* UBTI taxes owed: $1,348

Roth IRA: 13,450 shares, basis $83,490, 100% loss

* UBTI taxes owed: $16,594

How can this even remotely make sense? The Roth barely owned 20% more shares, 20% more in basis, yet owes over 10x the tax amount? That cannot be correct...isn't income/loss supposed to be attributed on a pro-rata basis to shareholders?

The Schedule D attached shows the break down of the gains/losses, none of it matches up with our actual loss on the stock in the account.

Should we call Vanguard tomorrow and find out what is going on? Could this be a mistake as far as how the PwC guy prepared it?

I'm not even sure what we are supposed to do....but they filed it late on their end, and IRS penalties/fees have been added in the meanwhile.",finance

personalfinance,Funding Study Abroad in Austria,"My girlfriend and I are both American citizens leaving our jobs to pursue study abroad in Austria. Pursuing this specific graduate degree at this specific institution has been on her radar for a while; I'm leaving to pursue a graduate degree to help with a change in career paths.

I've been evaluating options for loans to cover living expenses, as tuition costs are pretty nominal and could be paid out-of-pocket. The trouble is that most U.S. lenders and credit unions don't seem to lend to students who are studying abroad. Neither of our schools participate in the U.S. Federal Student Aid programs, so that's off the table.

Right now, I feel like my options may be limited to:

* Getting a personal loan - the downside would be higher interest rates and less flexible payment plans.
* Looking to see if any foreign banks will lend to me. Not sure if this will require proof of residency first, although we have already landed a lease agreement, so this would be possible.

The additional wrinkle would be that, ideally, we'd both co-sign for the loans which would be disbursed to a joint account. Proof of funding is required for Austrian residency permits, so I believe it would be important that both of are names are attached to the loan and to the checking account where funds end up, but this should be do-able.

personalfinance,Just curious how you’d approach this scenario (student loan),"Hi all,

So I recently switched jobs and went from making around $50k to around $90k. I don’t have any car loans, no mortgage (thanks moms basement) and no credit card debt.

Here’s where I’d like some input - would you put the money into a savings account and wait until you have the whole amount to pay off the loan and settle it in one go, or, should I make regular biweekly payments in excess of what is owed on the loan from my savings account. 


Right now I have about $7k saved in my Ally money market account that I was going to put towards a house but with this housing market being as stupid as it is and the new salary (plus my family is really great so I don’t mind living here and I am welcome to stay) I figured now would be a great time to attack debt.

Crypto holders are incentivized to participate in DeFi as a means of ""Yield Farming"". Basically, parking crypto assets into a liquidity pool so it can earn interest and fees, paid out in the form of an app-specific token.  Sometimes the annual interest returns are huge.

Cypto borrowers get a great deal through these apps too. Put up some coins as collateral, and in return you get instant access to liquidity. No credit checks, no applications... all automated. 

There is a lot of opaqueness in the DeFi market and like I said, I don't fully understand it all. What I understand for sure is:

1. DeFi depends on a consistent stream of incoming liquidity
2. DeFi also depends on the volume of transactions on the network (to collect fees)
3. The price stability of tokens on DeFi apps rely on arbitrage traders (a lot of this in the form of bots)
4. People who get into DeFi projects early see much higher returns. As returns drop, they move their liquidity elsewhere.

All fine in a controlled environment. But here's where I see it going all wrong.   
As the crypto market heated up in 2020, money began flooding into DeFi applications.  Since DeFi allows traders to leverage their assets to make bigger transactions...this in turn helped prop up the entire crypto market with a surge of new liquidity.  After all, all of those tokens previously sitting idle in people's wallets were now being put to work. 

The amount of value just locked into DeFi is now astronomical, currently somewhere over $66 Billion (down from a peak of almost $100 billion).  

But as the DeFi world started to heat up, more and more dApps came into the fold promising increasing interest and rewards. Interest rates in these pools are almost always higher when the coin or token supply is low and demand is high....as more people rush to participate, the yield returns typically drop.  

So we saw Yield Farmers getting increasingly sophisticated. To maximize rewards, many lenders started to run their tokens between different pools chasing the highest returns. 

Yield farmers also began to then re-invest the tokens received from one liquidity pool, into separate liquidity pools on other dApps for THAT token.  Creating complicated daisy chains of returns. 

To stretch things even thinner...many of them
then started to use their yields as collateral to BORROW more assets, then invest those in liquidity pools, to further increase their returns.

The economics behind this are pretty mind-numbing. Its akin to the mortgage backed securities situation in 2008. Basically....tons of collateralized ""junk"" assets are being traded, all based off a pool of inherently risky &amp; volatile crypto assets.  Remember, the market for these tokens only exists on DeFi.

Honestly its hard to wrap my head around. But I do know all of it depends on new liquidity and volume coming into the systems, and the value of the underlying tokens remains stable or growing.

So the big glaring question is....what the heck happens when the liquidity dries up or the value of the tokens drop off a cliff?

We've already seen multiple times how a dApp can have a meltdown.

* In Mar 2020, we saw the MakerDAO liquidity crisis . Basically, ETH price dropped...people rushed to  stablecoin DAI, and the app also triggered automatic liquidations (which malfunctioned). This caused a huge shortage of DAI on the system, and people to lose out big time.  [https://www.coindesk.com/makerdao-adds-usdc-as-defi-collateral-following-black-thursday-chaos](https://www.coindesk.com/makerdao-adds-usdc-as-defi-collateral-following-black-thursday-chaos)
* Later in Sept. 2020 we saw the SushiSwap rug pull. Long story short...a billion dollars flooded into SushiSwap DEX...then the developer pulls out all of his liquidity suddenly. The underlying token value plummeted...but so did the price of Ethereum (by 30%+), and subsequently bitcoin. 
* Then last month we saw the IRON/TITAN ""bank run"".... investors tried to redeem their stablecoins and sell the asset, leading to a massive selloff that tanked the token price to $0 [https://www.coindesk.com/iron-finance-says-it-suffered-cryptos-first-large-scale-bank-run-in-token-crash-postmortem](https://www.coindesk.com/iron-finance-says-it-suffered-cryptos-first-large-scale-bank-run-in-token-crash-postmortem)

So we already know potential consequences that can happen.   
 **1) bank runs on DeFi tokens are possible.**   
 **2)  A sharp drop in the value of any of the assets in a liquidity pool can lead to mass liquidations,**  
**3) When the value of DeFi tokens plummet suddenly, it takes the ""mainstream"" crypto market down with it**  
**4) All of this also has the potential to unpeg stablecoins**

As far as I can tell, all it would take is for the underlying crypto asset price of Ethereum or Bitcoin to crash low enough to trigger mass liquidations. Suddenly, you're left with a huge flight of liquidity, and tons of ""empty"" token pairs. 

As traders rush to get their tokens exchanged for ""safer"" assets, the liquidity pools are drained, and gas prices skyrocket. These combined effects could in-turn shut down the entire arbitrage and liquidation markets...all resulting in complete price instability. 

The mad-scramble for stablecoins would dry up all the supply in the midst of huge demand, likely unpegging the coins value. 

It would cause a catastrophic ripple effect throughout the entire market.  Even after the initial panic…once all of that leveraged lending goes away, and thousands of coins are unlocked/ sold onto the open market, it will be apocalyptic for crypto prices.  

Whether individual projects are ""good"" and some are ""bad"", doesn't really matter in this case. They've pretty much all been linked together in some way. If the biggest domino falls at the top, the rest come with it. 

Tbh, its kind of horrifying. 

**TL;DR:** The current DeFi ecosystem seems like the 2008 mortgage crisis, Bernie Madoff ponzi scheme, and Amway all rolled into one...and its going to collapse when the price of Bitcoin / Ethereum drop too low. Only this time, there's not going to be a bailout. Am I reading into this wrong?",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Should I refi - again?,"Help guys!  I'm having trouble trusting my gut on this one and need some other opinions.

Last May (2020) I refinanced my mortgage when the rates started crashing.  At that time I was 10 years into a 30 year mortgage at 5% + PMI.  At that time I wanted to reduce my interest rate and get rid of PMI.  My new mortgage is 15 years at 3.75%.  Of course, interest rates continued to drop over the past year.

This week my current mortgage company started calling me and launched right into the hard sell on a refinance:  12 years at 2.5% with $2900 closing and no appraisal.  Again, I'm not trying to take any money out or extend my mortgage (although the thought of a new kitchen and some other upgrades sure are tempting).  

It seems like a good deal and I'm not planning to move any time soon.  I'm doubting this due to the hard sell (they are calling back tomorrow).

Let's go...

Newly covered today: 

1. Notable news for upcoming Cardano DeFi projects. The New Jersey AG’s office has delivered a cease and desist letter to BlockFi. The AG’s press release cited BlockFi’s interest bearing deposit accounts as unregistered securities and also mentioned the lack of FDIC or SPIC insurance for it’s depositors.  This leaves some lingering questions for Cardano DeFi projects that might be planning to accept deposits or other transfers of value and offer a return of some type.  You could argue that these projects are decentralized where BlockFi was not. But, the AG’s press release seems to cite decentralization as one of the risks of DeFi projects. Also, as a practical matter, there is a question whether decentralization will be a good shield from regulators since many of these projects have companies and real humans with faces and names behind them unlike a truly anonymous founder such as Satoshi Nakamoto.

4. Professor Aggelos Kiayias recently dropped a video explaining exactly how Mithril (apparently neckbeard dungeon master talk for elf armor) is going to allow for Perfect Cardano (ADA) wallets that combine the ease of use and convenience of light wallets with the trustlessness of full node wallets. We also learned exactly how Mithril is going to work. [https://youtu.be/LhepJFCyWRk](https://youtu.be/LhepJFCyWRk)
5. In proof-of-work, bootstrapping can be done with blockheaders. This won’t do in proof-of-stake since we need information about stakeholder distribution to confirm block validity.
6. Mithril fixes this by being a cryptographic construction that enables a population of stakeholders to issue a signature consistent with certain constraints.
7. For Mithril to work in proof-of-stake, it needs three crucial properties: 1) it needs to enforce a threshold ratio of stakeholders before the signature is issued; 2) the pre-signature fragments must be independently verified and subject to public aggregation; and 3) it must be efficient in the sense that the final signature is of constant size and is logarithmically dependent on the # of stakeholders.
8. Stakeholders will issue special Mithril keys along with the normal cryptographic key material. Then at regular intervals, full nodes will test whether they can produce a pre-signature fragment. Only a random subset of stakeholders will be eligible to produce a pre-signature fragment. When a sufficient # of pre-signature fragments have been issued by eligible stakeholders then it will be possible to aggregate the fragments into a final signature.
9. This will be a checkpoint that will be verifiable with respect to previous check points all the way back to the genesis block. Such checkpoints will be cryptographic commitments of the relevant UTXOs.
10. Since the checkpoints will be trustless, a light client (i.e. wallet) will only need to verify the sequence of checkpoints up to the current time to trustlessly bootstrap.

53. Days like today in Cardano and the greater crypto space always reminds me that there have been other great adoption stories that went through periods like this.[https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1407077949774442499](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1407077949774442499)
54. It looks like the second biggest ETH stakepool or it's custody provider has lost it’s users private keys to $75MM in ETH. Cardano doesn’t have this problem. We get to keep custody of our crypto because we found a better way than slashing. [https://stakehound.com/blog-post/fireblocks-eth-2-key-management-incident/](https://stakehound.com/blog-post/fireblocks-eth-2-key-management-incident/) [https://twitter.com/JamesSpediacci/status/1407465311180255236](https://twitter.com/JamesSpediacci/status/1407465311180255236)
55. Draft table of contents for Mastering Cardano has been revealed. [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1407165366355124225](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1407165366355124225)
56. COTI (a project with very close ties to Cardano) is coming to Ledger. [https://medium.com/cotinetwork/coti-native-is-coming-to-ledger-c56b04df1253](https://medium.com/cotinetwork/coti-native-is-coming-to-ledger-c56b04df1253)
57. The June Cardano 360 is currently available on Youtube. [https://youtu.be/al5m14299ww](https://youtu.be/al5m14299ww)
58. We saw segments on various newer partner entities like Nervos, Orion Protocol, and Revuto. Nervos is a UTXO proof-of-work blockchain which is building a cross-chain bridge with Cardano so that you can use your ADA on Nervos dApps and vice versa. Interoperability is a big theme for Nervos and they plan to have a working testnet within a month. Orion Protocol is building a terminal that will allow for decentralized non-custodial trading across centralized and decentralized exchanges. They say this would not require you to KYC or even have an account with any of these exchanges. Revuto is an online subscription management service that recently completed a $10MM token sale on Cardano.
59. It was also revealed that Wolfram Labs, COTI, and IOHK have a three-way partnership (a ménage à tech) to build an NFT auction site. The people from Wolfram were talking about very interesting things including live minting during streaming events and automated upload to IPFS. COTI will be building out auction and bidding mechanisms in ADAPay.
60. Professor Aggelos Kiayias gave us an update on research including that Ouroboros Chronos and Hydra papers have both been accepted into conferences/journals. Chronos will provide Cardano with a global concept of time that doesn’t rely on any outside timekeeper. Prof. Kiayias also pointed out that Hydra is distinguishable from other layer two protocols in that the scripting language is identical to that of the base layer in Cardano such that any dApp that can run on Cardano will run on the Hydra L2. This is a huge plus and superior to many other layer two solutions in other ecosystems where the base layer dApps will not run on layer two. Finally, the Mithril paper has been submitted for peer review. It will provide Cardano light wallets with Succinct Non-interactive Arguments of Knowledge that will give us the best of both worlds: no delays for syncing as in full node wallets while still preserving trustlessness.
61. Finally, the Goguen Summit will be in late September. Sign up now at [summit.cardano.org](http://summit.cardano.org/).
62. The Fed is once again STRONGLY signalling to us that they are going to regulate stablecoins. The Fed is also specifically calling out Tether for the first time. You need to be thinking about how stablecoin regulation might affect your favorite Cardano DeFi or other project. [https://twitter.com/CaitlinLong\_/status/1408500265397985282](https://twitter.com/CaitlinLong_/status/1408500265397985282) [https://twitter.com/CaitlinLong\_/status/1408572624125534212](https://twitter.com/CaitlinLong_/status/1408572624125534212)
63. People are starting to realize that the Stakehound private key loss in ETH may attract unwanted regulatory attention to Ethereum 2.0 while this problem could never have occurred in Cardano. Also, only a few days later another ETH stakepool (this time SharedStake...the sixth biggest ETH Stakepool) allegedly experiences a rugpull that some are valuing at over $30MM. This is another problem that could not happen in Cardano staking. It feels like we stepped into the ring, they rang the bell, and ETH just started punching itself in the head. Eventually it’s going to KO itself.

79. Robert Kornacki of dcSpark releases an article on why every Cardano dApp will use NFTs. The article contains some very interesting discussion on smart contracts in the EUTXO context including language instructing that “UTXOs have smart contracts attached to them and not the other way around” and “\[...\]the simplest way to think about it is that when a UTXO is created it has the option to have a smart contract attached to it.” [https://medium.com/dcspark/every-eutxo-dapp-will-use-nfts-and-heres-why-fd87e6a8c9a6](https://medium.com/dcspark/every-eutxo-dapp-will-use-nfts-and-heres-why-fd87e6a8c9a6)

100. Very interesting timing with a) Grayscale Buying $50MM ETCG, b) Grayscale adding ADA, and c) Charles joining the ETC Cooperative board given that two of the members of the ETC Cooperative board seem to come from Grayscale and DCG.

124. The El Faro article reporting meetings between Cardano, Whizgrid of Cyprus, and the brothers of President Bukele of El Salvador definitely contain some extremely interesting details related to a possible Salvadorean national stablecoin by the end of the year and a possible digitization and blockchain storage of a wide range of government related documents next year.

CryptoCurrency,The real reason for the sub-30k dip,"I’ve been reading a lot of posts trying to look on charts and apply confirmation bias to their TA, explaining how the market is manipulated and the collective mind of whales fucks us over.

That’s a load of shit. There is no whale/institution hive-mind. Let’s take off our tinfoil hats and try to find the event that triggered the sell-off.

On 15 July, there was a congressional hearing starring Powell, on the topic of cryptocurrencies and America’s own CBDC. I believe this hearing has shaken the market, since Powell sent some mixed signals.

Here’s a quote: “…it’s not that they didn’t aspire to be a payment mechanism, it’s that they have completely failed to become one except for people who desire anonymity, for whatever reason”. Classic “crypto is only used to purchase drugs and money laundering” FUD. This fossil is still living in 2012 I guess.

He also said that if the Fed would set up a CBDC, there would be no need for any other stablecoin/cryptocurrency. Of course, he has no idea about smart contract platforms, because if he did, he would know crypto isn’t just “digital cash” anymore. This remark sent a clear message: “We want to kill all crypto with the CBDC”.

He also hinted at the need for regulation of stablecoins (which I completely agree with). Regulatory clarity would be good for the market. But I believe this also contributed to the accelerated decrease in price we’ve seen. Why? Because Tether. If it would come to strict regulation, Tether would be probably toast. It’s still a major liquidity source on exchanges, so it’s not good news in the short term.

Of course, the market is a complex beast, and one single event can’t account for all of the price movement. But I see this as one of the major factors we dipped below 30k.

CryptoCurrency,Cryptocurrencies and the german elections,"As (hopefully) all of my german friends in this sub know, we are less than two months away from elections in Germany. If you haven't voted yet, maybe my post will help you with your decision. I decided to look through the election programs of the major parties. For all the non-germans in this sub, I hope you still find it useful to get a picture of what politics in Germany think about cryptocurrencies. Let's dive right in:

* CDU (Christian Democrats): Cryptocurrencies are basically not really a part of their program. The only part I found about crypto is that they want know people's identity before they can change their assets to cash and the other way around (anti money laundering).
* SPD (Social Democrats): No mention of cryptocurrencies in their program.
* Grüne (green): \[deepl translation\] ""For all digital payments and cryptocurrencies, the actual beneficial owners must be identified above a certain threshold, analogous to regulations for cash. To combat crimes such as money laundering, the depiction of sexual violence against children, tax evasion and terrorist financing clear rules for the area of digital payments as well. We want to expand existing cooperation obligations of crypto exchanges and train investigating authorities appropriately in this area. We want to do justice to the rapid developments in the area of decentralized financial applications and to take into account the opportunities and risks of cryptocurrencies and blockchains."" Apart from that, there will be taxes for cryptos, even if you hold them for longer than a year.
* FDP (Free Democrats): \[deepl translation\] ""Preserve cash, promote cryptocurrencies. We Free Democrats are committed to the unrestricted usability of cash as a means of payment. Cash should remain as an alternative to digital payment formats. At the same time, we welcome the further development of cryptocurrencies. Cash allows us to store money without government control and monitoring. In addition, the ability of citizens to switch to cash sets tight limits on the European Central Bank's negative interest rate policy. Central Bank's negative interest rate policy. We also welcome alternative means of exchange such as cryptocurrencies on blockchain as well as other bases and want to promote and further develop the creation of a reliable legal framework.""
* Linke (Left): \[deepl translation\] ""We strive for a ban on energy- and resource-wasting generation of of so-called cryptocurrencies."" yeah...
* AfD (Right): They are against digital currencies controlled by central banks. Other than that, there is no information on cryptocurrencies.

As you can see, crypto is not really such a big deal yet. The greens and the free democrats have the most information and both seem to understand the value and potential of the tech. Greens will tax you though.

TL;DR: only greens and free democrats really mention cryptos, left wants to ban them. Greens will tax crypto.

Edit: In times like these, there are far more important things than a parties attitude towards cryptos. I just wanted to give an overview of how the major parties deal with the topic",cryptocurrency

algorand,Security best practices for your Crypto and your Devices - from an IT Security Professional w/30yrs in the business.,"Of note:  This is not a comprehensive, all inclusive, list.  These are some best practices that anyone can do to protect themselves, their devices and their crypto.  This is written with newer investors in mind but more experienced investors may find it a useful reminder.  I hope folks find it helpful.

&amp;#x200B;

# Cryptocurrency best practices:

* Never, ever, for the love of God, invest more than you can afford to live without.  Don't invest your rent, mortgage, bill payment or food/gas/living expenses money.  Do not buy crypto on credit or take out loans to buy it either.
* Never talk about how much crypto you have. It's a bad idea because it makes you a target.  The wonderful thing about crypto is it's decentralized and you have full control of your money. The terrible thing about crypto is it's decentralized and you have full control of your money. If a hacker penetrates your security and gets your crypto you're screwed, no recourse, your money is gone. So why make yourself a target by advertising? Contrary to popular belief the internet is not anonymous.  People can, and will, find out who you are and even where you live if they think it's worth doing it.
* Make sure you use reputable exchanges.  Google reviews of the site before sending any money or even creating an account.  When in doubt feel free to ask here.  The biggies are (in no particular order):  Coinbase, Coinbase Pro, Binance (not available in USA, [Binance.us](https://Binance.us) is but isn't as good), Kraken, KuCoin, Gemini, [Crypto.com](https://Crypto.com).  There are others, these are just some of the better known ones.
* Back up your seed phrases on something durable and store them OFFLINE in a safe place. (one copy in your safe, another in a safety deposit box is a good choice).
* Do not lose your seed phrases!
* Never give your seed phrases or passwords to anyone for any reason.
* For the love of god, don't fall for any ""Send me # crypto and I'll send you # crypto back"" scams.
* Do Your Own Research!!!!!!   Do not take someone else's word for a crypto being a good investment.  Value their opinion but verify the information separately, on your own.  I have a [post on how to DYOR in my profile](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/oetc63/some_simple_dyor_tips/).
* When you get a software wallet, which you should if you have more than a couple hundred dollars worth of crypto, make sure it's the official one, not a copycat.  Always use a link from their official site to download software wallets.
* When you get a hardware wallet (I typically tell friends to wait until they have at least 10x the price of the wallet in crypto to buy one) Only order hardware wallets using their official links.  NEVER buy or use 2nd hand wallets or 'free' wallets you get in the mail (yep... that's a thing).
* Never download any app for crypto that isn't from the official website or linked from it.  There are tons of scams out there that will try to get you to download bogus wallets, apps and even bogus exchange apps. Always go to the official website for an application and use their links to their official downloads.

# Some further security advice if you want it.

Warning... it's long.  I've been in the IT industry for over 30 years now and working in Cybersecurity roles for over 15.  It's terrifying how few people practice even basic security methods to keep themselves safe in the online world of today. The recent ransomware attacks on the pipeline and meat industry?  Totally preventable with some basic security practices. This is true of the vast majority of hacking/virus/malware/ransomware attacks.  So.. if you wish to help keep yourself safe online feel free to read below.

&amp;#x200B;

**Keep your devices up to date**

Always keep your devices on their latest security patches! I don't care if you're scared that windows update MIGHT break something or your apps might have issues if you update your iOS version (My wife's favorite complaint). I'd rather have to revert to a last known good than allow a script hacker using a downloaded exploit kit get into my system with ease. It's just not worth the risk to keep your system unpatched because 1 in 10,000 people experience an issue with update # XYZ from Microsoft/Apple/Whomever.

1. No, Apple computers are not hack/virus/malware proof. They are just as susceptible to vulnerabilities as any other platform. A LOT of apple users buy into the myth that the OS is more secure than MS. TECHNICALLY it does have fewer total known vulnerabilities but... it only takes one and more are found all the time. No OS is ""safe"", not even Linux.
2. Keep all of your apps, not just your antivirus and antimalware, up to date as well. It can be a pain keeping everything up to date on a PC because there's not a lot of automatic updating going on for 3rd party apps and most of the time it's a manual process. There's apps like PatchMyPC that help with this (do research before using one) and can make your life a whole lot easier.
3. Speaking of Antivirus don't just use antivirus. Get a good anti-malware solution as well. As to antivirus, ironically Windows 10's built in defender is actually a pretty decent antivirus solution these days so you can just stick with that and a good malware program if you don't want to pay for MacAfee, Norton, Kaspersky or one of the other premium AntiVirus programs. But make sure you have a good antivirus and a good anti-malware solution and that you use them.  Not just on your PC, also on your devices.  Folks often ask me, and no this is not an endorsement of any particular software or hardware please do your own research, so I'll go ahead and answer now: on PC I use Windows Defender + MalwareBytes as well as the Ghostery browser extension to block ads on any browser that doesn't already block them.  On my android I use Bitdefender.
4. By the way... yes... Apple computers need antivirus and antimalware too.  They are every bit as vulnerable to viruses, malware, spyware and ransomware as any other computer, including Linux.

&amp;#x200B;

**Use Two Factor authentication**

Even online games have 2FA these days. So use 2FA on any website you log into that has any kind of sensitive information on it, especially anything financial or email accounts. Wherever possible use an authenticator app rather than email or SMS for your 2FA. SMS is good if nothing else is available but phones can be sim spoofed and email can be hacked. So get a good 2FA app (like Google Authenticator or Authy) and use it or get a 2FA device like a YubiKey. Even Reddit supports 2FA now. Absolutely use 2FA for any site you buy/sell crypto on!  I even use 2FA on my online games when it's available.

&amp;#x200B;

**Periodically check your email addresses to make sure they haven't been breached.**

A great way to do this is to check [https://haveibeenpwned.com/](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) and put your email address in to see if it's been reported in any breach reports. It's a very reputable site and is well maintained. No, you aren't putting anything at risk by putting your email address there. People can already get that easily enough. You're checking to see if your **password** has been hacked.

&amp;#x200B;

**Password Security**

Don't re-use passwords if at all possible. Use a different password for every site and make sure they're complex, especially for email accounts. Never re-use an email account password because that's how sites reset your 2FA or password (or both) and if your email gets hacked all bets could be off.

If you have trouble making complex passwords use autogenerated ones from Chrome or Brave browsers built in password service or get KeePass, Bitwarden or any number of other good password utilities. Some VPN suppliers provide one and a lot of ISPs do now as well. You can also use these utilities to store them securely so you won't forget them. A bonus to using them is most password utilities, and some browsers, also have an option to check breach reports to see if your accounts stored in them have been compromised somewhere so you can proactively go change your passwords there.

&amp;#x200B;

**IMPORTANT NOTE:**  *If you find that an account HAS been breached, immediately change that password and, if you've used that password anywhere else go change it there too.*

&amp;#x200B;

**Use a paid VPN to keep your network traffic private!**

I do not recommend using the free VPN applications offered by various browsers, ISPs, etc. They are junk and they log and they are not truly secure. There are a couple free VPN's (sort of free trials) out there that are secure but they have limited bandwidth or limited servers to choose from and they generally don't support split tunneling or many other important features. Pay the 5 or 6 bucks a month for a good one, it's worth it. No, it's not going to noticeably slow down your internet unless you're downloading a lot of really big files (more on that in a minute). Most good VPN solutions even let you stream videos just fine without any issue. I do it all the time on mine.

A VPN is vitally important if you ever use public Wi-Fi at a restaurant, store, workplace, hotel, etc. It encrypts your connection so that anyone looking at traffic on that network can't tell where you're going or what you're doing. This protects all your traffic, not just web sites, and makes you immune to MITM attacks. I won't recommend any one VPN over any other, there are a lot of really good ones. Because people ask I will admit that I prefer NordVPN but that's not an endorsement.  There are websites that routinely rank them. Do some research and pick one you like.

&amp;#x200B;

The big things to look for in whatever VPN you choose are:

1. AES 256 or better encryption. (many VPN provides call this military grade even though it really isn't.)
2. Integrated Kill Switch that kills your internet connection if your VPN drops.
3. Maximum Connection Speed.
4. Unlimited Data Transmission.
5. Firewall.
6. Multiple Device Support.
7. Worldwide Servers.
8. VPN Blocking Prevention (some websites, like Netflix, try to block people using VPN's. Make sure your VPN has blocking prevention as one of it's features if you plan to stream)
9. Split Tunnel availability (Useful for sites or apps that choke on VPN's, also useful for gamers who need to avoid latency for their video games.)
10. No Logging

&amp;#x200B;

Some 'nice to have' items:

* Multi-Hop VPN capability
* Anonymous DNS Server services
* Peer-to-Peer support (if you use any peer-to-peer network applications)

&amp;#x200B;

Note: If you have trouble using a website or app with your VPN you can use split tunneling for that specific app or website (thus why it's on my must have list) to allow your traffic to and from that app or website to bypass your VPN. Use it sparingly but it may be necessary from time to time.

&amp;#x200B;

**Don't use any Browser Extensions that aren't for your security!**

I can't stress this one enough. Sure, you might be able to use a Facebook plugin in chrome to block all cute kitten posts, or whatever, but those extensions can contain keyloggers, track everywhere you go on the internet AND report them back to their creator/owner and even, in some cases, execute code on your system or take captures of what's on your screen. Even benign extensions typically include a permission like: ""Read and change all your data on the websites you visit"". Do you really want some random extension developer to have access to that kind of information on everything you do in your browser? Even if that permission isn't included when you load it they can add it later and if you aren't paying attention you may miss it.

The only browser extensions I feel are worth it are ones that come with your antivirus or antimalware software and a good add blocker if one isn't built into your browser already (not an endorsement but I personally use Ghostery). Believe it or not, there are malicious ads out there that can be used as a penetration avenue against your system and they can wind up on sites that you would typically trust, like Facebook, and others. Never turn off your ad blocker, no matter what the website you're visiting bitches about. I'd rather not read their content than turn off my add blocker.

&amp;#x200B;

**Important!**  *If you are using any extensions check periodically to make sure they're up to date and verify they haven't been discontinued.*

&amp;#x200B;

**Android Don't:**

Don't ever side-load apps. You have no way of knowing if that app is trustworthy or not. And... guess what one of the most prolific hacks in side loaded apps is right now? Jacking your phone and using it to mine crypto in the background... another big one is keylogging to steal crypto keys and, of course, ransomware, malware, etc.

No, you can't mine crypto on your phone as it's banned on both Apple and Google's stores.  For good reason.  It will fry your device very very quickly and, end of the day, the device isn't powerful enough to mine enough to bother.  The crypto-jackers that hack phones to do it only make it work by jacking thousands of phones and aggregate their gains and even then it's only profitable because they don't have to replace the devices they destroy in the process.

&amp;#x200B;

**iOS Don't:**

Do not assume that your device is 'safe' just because it's an iOS device.  It's not.  iOS has plenty of vulnerabilities that can be exploited.  Make sure you keep your iOS devices up to date and have antivirus and antimalware on them as well as ad blocking extensions if possible.

***All Devices: If your device no longer gets the latest security updates from the vendor... GO GET A NEW ONE!  Seriously... outdated devices are super easy to penetrate.  Personally I prefer to always use devices that can support the latest OS version as well.***

&amp;#x200B;

# Some good habits to get in to protect yourself from Malware, Addware, Ransomware and Viruses:

* Don't click on links in emails, SMS messages, Discord, etc. Look at the URL and google the site to see if it's trustworthy first then manually type the address into your browser if it appears to be legitimate. URL's can be faked in a number of ways. Also always pay attention to the end of the URL (not the beginning) to make sure it's a real domain. Google isn't \[[www.google.com](https://www.google.com)\]([https://www.google.com](https://www.google.com))\\\*\\\*.mycoolwebsite.com\\\*\\\* (for example). Also best to hover your mouse over the URL before clicking it. This will usually show the real URL in a hovering textbox. Make sure the URL is legitimate before using it. You can also use Trend Micro's Site Safety checker or other URL checkers if you want to be extra careful.
* I highly recommend turning off dynamic display in your email. Basically this turns off images, links, etc in your email and disables scripts. Email is one of the most common ways hackers get access to you.  If you want more information feel free to use your preferred search engine to research it.
* Please remember: No bank/exchange/website/whatever is EVER going to ask you to send them your password/secret word/whatever. If you get a message/email/whatever of that type report it as phishing and block it. The IRS (or whatever your country's tax institution is) isn't going to ask you for your banking information or your social security number (guess what, they already know what bank you use and they already have your SSN) Don't ever give out private information to someone you aren't expecting a call from on the phone, SMS message Email or whatever and, even then, try to make sure you know that they are who they say they are before giving out any information.
* Don't download random crap from the internet! Stick to trusted sources of files if you have to download something. And even then use your antivirus program to scan it immediately after you download it. Also check the file hash before extracting it. This can be done using Certutil -hashfile ‘filename’ sha256 in the windows cmd line (on Linux you can use sha256sum ‘filename’) you can then enter the hash these commands return into \[[VirusTotal.com](https://VirusTotal.com)\]([https://VirusTotal.com](https://VirusTotal.com)) to see if it comes back malicious.  You can even upload any file to \[[VirusTotal.com/gui](https://VirusTotal.com/gui)\]([https://VirusTotal.com/gui](https://VirusTotal.com/gui)) before running/opening it and the site will allow you to run security scans on it there as well.
* Some applications will offer to install 3rd party software as part of their delivery. I hightly recommend that you always decline those and then go get those applications directly from the actual vendor, yourself, if you want them. At minimum the one wrapped into whatever installer you're using will be out of date and full of vulnerabilities. At worst it could have a virus, malware or rootkits embedded.
* Consider using the TOR browser if you go to sites you don't fully trust (I recommend avoiding them but if you feel you MUST go to them, be safe about it). It's a fork of Mozilla with some built in security settings to help prevent it from being compromised and it uses built in 3 hop protection (beyond your VPN) to keep you even more anonymous when browsing. Another good alternative is the Brave browser.  Epic Browser is another good privacy and security oriented browser and Ghostery is working on their own as well.

personalfinance,Help! Getting student loans out of default while needing $$ to attend grad school!,"Hey all,

The title says a lot, but I'll try to give more info, and keep it short!

Throughout my 20s, I was suicidal and didn't plan on making it to 30 -- so I defaulted on my federal student loans. I've made it, and I'm hoping to attend graduate school this fall. Obviously, my student loans are in default, but I just entered the student loan rehabilitation process (hurray!). However, that is a 9-10 month process before having that removed from my credit report.

&amp;#x200B;

I want/hope to take out a private student loan to supplement the costs of grad school, but I've been rejected because of these defaulted loans, even though I'm working to fix that. Do you all have any advice/places to look to get private loans? Any and all advice would be greatly appreciated.

personalfinance,Removing PMI with a reappraisal?,I'm looking into potentially getting the PMI payments on my mortgage removed by getting my home reappraised.  Back in April of 2020 I refinanced to significantly lower my interest rate and the appraisal back then put me at 85% principal to home value ratio. With the current market I'm fairly sure that the value of my home has increased enough to put me well below the 80% principal to home value ratio required. The Zillow Zestimate would put me at 71% principal to home value ratio. Is there any real downside to trying this aside from the cost of the appraisal and the home somehow not appraising high enough?,finance
personalfinance,Am I being charged too high an interest rate on a family loan?,"Just looking for any opinions, as I may be overthinking this. I just recently starting looking at moving into a new house because our oldest son is going to be going to school soon and we don't really love where we are currently at. I was looking at our house value and how it has appreciated since we purchased it in 2017 (I'm still way in over my head with this kind of stuff, but I think I get the gist of it). That's when  I went back and looked at our original lending plan and saw our interest rate of 3.5%. My father-in-law graciously bought the house for us and we are paying him back for it. But it's not a lose-lose for him,  as we have been faithfully paying it back and haven't missed a beat.

Anyway,  as I'm looking at all this I see an advertisement on bankrate or zillow, can't remember which, that had the current rates of the houses I  was looking at an APR of 2.26%. That got my attention as I thought, per   my father-in-law, that he was charging me as low an interest rate as legally possible without getting into some tax problems. I've done a  quick look into family loans and it looks like that is not true, but I  could be way off on that. I don't think he is intentionally lying, I  think his financial advisors and managers are just making sure he doesn't lose money.

All that to ask, what should I do here? I don't want to be ungrateful for the help they've shown us, but at the same time,e I want to make the best investment for my family and our future. We have a great relationship and I don't think he would be upset if I came to him with some evidence of lower rates. Thanks in advance!",finance

Let's say all else is equal between the two banks. The only difference is that Bank B has a slightly better interest rate, but I've been a customer of Bank A already for several years. **Is there value in being a long-time customer of a bank, for example when it comes to getting a mortgage or other lines of credit?** Does it have any practical impact?

personalfinance,Can I afford this home?,"I currently make ~145k a year and am considering purchasing a home for $418k. 

The appraisal will come in soon and it could appraise lower, allowing for a potential renegotiation, however, I’m not banking on that. 

This home has everything we want and it’s located in a nice area. I tend to be frugal on most other things but do want to invest in my home. 

I currently pay around $1700 for rent and $300 for utilities. 

My new mortgage (I put 3% down at an interest rate of 3.1%) will be $2475 a month. 

The calculators tell me I am okay and if I follow the 28% rule, I am also fine. 

I keep thinking, “what if I wait”, but with the current market trends and homes in this location (this home has impact Windows and doors and has been remodeled), I’m not sure I’ll find something substantially better anytime soon. 

Was hoping to start a discussion and get some words of wisdom. I can provide any more information if necessary.

The above figure at $2475 does already include property taxes and homeowners insurance. My partner is paying PMI and utilities. This figure is only what I am responsible for.",finance

financialindependence,I did it! I’ve reached the final step in my FIRE and moved to Portugal,"I’m 36 years years old with $9,200 passive income coming in monthly. I have $346,000 in the bank I’m hoping to transfer into Euro’s when the dollar grows stronger. I’m holding out hoping to reach .90 or greater. My plan is to divide the money by 1/3 or 1/4 transfers that way I end up with an average. 

The bulk of my passive income comes from owning rental property. I know that’s really frowned upon here on Reddit. I earned the VA loan by going to war. I then lived extremely frugally for 10-15 years and bought places I fixed up myself. I have tenants that I’ve only raised their rent $100 in the last eight years. I’m not saying everyone should have to go to war but the thought process that I’m some monster isn’t accurate. I also had tenants abuse the eviction moratorium and stop paying so they could buy a house. 

My short term goals are to find some property and build it up like a resort. I want a huge outdoor kitchen, ponds, projector for watching movies at night, several cabins, a wood and hobby shop, and other amenities. The plan is to build my home or maybe even restore a ruin so that it’s energy efficient and reliant on things like solar panels and natural water sources to keep bills low and be more eco friendly. I have no idea what I’ll find yet but the process of having all these amenities will likely take years and I will be doing the bulk of the work myself. 

I’m not familiar with Portugal at all so I plan to spend the next several months to a year traveling around and figuring out where I want to buy property. 

Since firing several years ago my biggest obstacle has been staying busy. A day where I don’t accomplish anything is hard on me. I’ve been able to fill the void with traveling and wood working hobbies. I’ve  also built a few homes from the ground up. I would like to build this home in Portugal so that I’m still able to travel when I’d like. How great would it be to spend winters in Vietnam? Im also considering building nice accommodations for people who want to stay and have bills paid in exchange for basic upkeep. Something like a WOOFing program. 

I spent several years traveling around the world and figuring out where to live. Why Portugal? Access to the rest of Europe, the D7 Visa, great food, culture, weather, lower cost of living, low crime, friendly people, English is widely spoken (I plan to become fluent in Portuguese), tons of history, outdoor activists etc. I’m so happy to be here!

Interest rates are really good in Portugal so I’m less inclined to pay cash for the property. I’m honestly not sure what to do with all the money sitting in the bank. I’ve always wanted to invest in stocks but I’m afraid to gamble. Maybe ETF’s?

If anyone has any questions I would be more than happy to answer. I would also love some input and advice!

CryptoCurrency,Shot's fired from Paxos: both USDC‘s and Tether’s tokens are “stablecoins” in anything other than name- both of their products are backed by illiquid and risky debt obligations — a critical weakness that no prudential regulator would allow to exist as this creates undue risk for all token holders,"A Regulated Stablecoin Means Having a Regulator

I have been reading with a combination of disbelief and exasperation the recent [**claims**](https://www.coindesk.com/circle-is-not-winning-stablecoin-transparancy-race) by Circle that “USDC has become the world’s most trusted and well-regulated dollar digital currency,” as well as [**claims**](https://www.coindesk.com/what-tether-means-when-it-says-its-regulated) by  Tether that “Tether is registered and regulated.”  Neither USDC nor  Tether is a regulated digital asset, for the simple reason that neither  token has a regulator.

USDC and Tether are used frequently in the crypto economy and have a  useful role to play, just as Bitcoin, Ethereum and other unregulated  digital assets play an important role. Users who are willing to tolerate  the risk of a token backed by only 61% cash or cash equivalents (in the  case of USDC) or 5% (in the case of Tether) should be free to take that  risk — subject of course to applicable securities laws. But these  tokens are not regulated, and **they should never be confused with a regulated token.** 

 The principal value of regulatory oversight is to ensure that the *reserves consist of real, liquid, accessible dollars* — if neither USDC nor Tether can fulfill these promises, ***can they even be considered dollar-backed stablecoins?*** 

**REGULATED STABLECOINS**

As of today, there are exactly three regulated dollar-backed  stablecoins in the world: Paxos Standard (“PAX”) and Binance Dollar  (“BUSD”), both issued by Paxos Trust Company, and the Gemini Dollar  (“GUSD”), issued by Gemini Trust Company. Paxos and Gemini are both  Trust companies regulated by the New York State Department of Financial  Services (“NYDFS”). Trusts are required to have their products and  services approved and supervised by NYDFS. [**PAX**](https://www.dfs.ny.gov/reports_and_publications/press_releases/pr1809101), [**BUSD**](https://www.dfs.ny.gov/reports_and_publications/press_releases/pr1909051) and [**GUSD**](https://www.dfs.ny.gov/reports_and_publications/press_releases/pr1809101) are expressly approved by the NYDFS and supervised by the regulator on an ongoing basis. This means:

* The value of each stablecoin token is tied directly to the value  of the US dollar, and the amount of “reserve” dollars equal or exceed  the number of stablecoins outstanding.
* Regulators are overseeing the establishment and maintenance of reserves backing the stablecoins.
* Reserves  may only be held in the safest forms, such as FDIC-insured bank  accounts and in short-term maturity US Treasury instruments.
* Reserves  are fully segregated from corporate assets, specifically for the  benefit of token holders, and are held bankruptcy remote pursuant to the  New York Banking Law.

Regulatory oversight is important because it assures stablecoin users  that the dollars underlying their stablecoins are secure and will be  immediately available when they want them. The NYDFS ensures the Trust  companies and their individual tokens are following its strict rules at  all times. Additionally, NYDFS regulatory oversight meets the ten  high-level recommendations for stablecoins set forth by the Financial  Stability Board in an important [**report**](https://www.fsb.org/wp-content/uploads/P131020-3.pdf) issued last year for the G20.

**UNREGULATED “STABLECOINS”**

“Stablecoins” not subject to prudential regulation do not have the  same oversight and guardrails. USDC and Tether reserves are not  comprehensively overseen by any financial regulators. Their reserves are  broadly unrestricted and not held bankruptcy-remote under applicable  law. This means:

* The [**USDC**](https://www.centre.io/hubfs/pdfs/attestation/Grant-Thorton_circle_usdc_reserves_07162021.pdf) and [**Tether**](https://www.coindesk.com/tether-first-reserve-composition-report-usdt) reserves are backed substantially by corporate debt obligations.
* The consumer is not protected or guaranteed to get their dollars back when they redeem the token. 
* There is illiquidity risk because these investments have maturities as long as several years. 
* There is credit risk from a corporate default. 
* There is interest rate risk that can impair the value of longer maturity securities. 
* In the case of USDC, reserves are held on Circle’s [**balance sheet**](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001824301/000121390021036070/ea143875ex99-6_concordacq.htm), implying that Circle views USDC reserves as its own property.  
* The issuer can (and often does) use consumer funds to pursue risky high-yield investments for its own financial gain.

personalfinance,"Repair or replace vehicle? Extremely tight budget (CO, US)","I have a 2012 VW GTI with 99,000 miles on it. I bought it in 2013. The check engine light came on in June and I brought it to the VW dealership right away for a repair. After doing quite a bit of work ([previous post about work done by VW](https://www.reddit.com/r/Volkswagen/comments/ohtfdm/vw_dealership_says_engine_replacement_needed_for/)), the dealership says the engine was damaged by a timing chain problem. VW says this is a known issue. My car is not drivable and has been sitting at the VW dealership since June 30th. It automatically shuts off a few minutes after starting due to low oil pressure. If I want to take it anywhere, I’ll need to tow it.

According to VW, they will only cover 25% of the engine replacement due to the mileage and age of the vehicle. **VW is quoting about $12,000 for the engine replacement and labor (I would pay 75% of this, about $9,000)**. I have contacted corporate VW, opened an escalation case, spoken to a “supervisor”, but they are not budging on 25%.

I got a quote from a 3rd party German auto shop: $7500 for a used engine with 40k miles, and $5500 for a used engine with 109k miles. Because these engines are used, the 3rd party shop can’t guarantee these engines won’t take a shit after one is installed. I don't think I'm willing to take this kind of a risk, but I could be convinced if someone has a successful experience to share. 

**Income situation:**

I just completed my undergrad in May (long story, tl;dr: I went back to school in my late 20’s to pursue my life’s passion. I’m 33). I have spent the last few years living off grants, scholarships, student loans, and a part time job on campus.

I am wrapping up a summer internship making $16/hour, at 40 hours/week. This internship will become full time regular employment in August, at which point I will get a raise to $20/hour. It will take a few years of gaining experience in my new field before I can expect to make much more than this. 

Once I get this raise, I will need to start paying for my health insurance (I was on Medicaid as a student) through my employer, about $240/m. I’ll also need to purchase my own separate dental plan… I have no idea how much that will cost. **If I assume taxes and health insurance deductions will be roughly 25% of my gross pay (is this a correct estimate?), my take home will be ~ $2600/m.** 

**Total monthly expenses:** 

Rent, auto insurance, mobile phone, utilities, pets (two cats), food (mostly cook at home), doctors’ appointments and prescriptions, and misc home supplies total just under $1800/m. I use my credit card to pay everything except rent. I pay off the balance every month before interest is applied and I churn cash back into the next month’s CC statement. 

In addition to these monthly expenses, I will need to start making student loan payments soon. Thankfully, I only needed to take government student loans. My monthly student loan payments will be around $425/m. 

**Credit:** 

I have some old credit cards on auto pay that I use for a tank of gas once or twice a year. I have over $30,000 in available credit, which I could use to help pay for the new engine. The best interest rate on one of my cards is 9.5%.

The sales manager said they would “work with me” if I purchased a vehicle through their dealership: they will waive the outstanding repair bill (about $700) and give me $1,100 for my current VW as a trade in only. 

My credit score is above 750 with all creditors, average credit account age is over 12 years. Despite this, I doubt I would qualify for an auto loan at a reasonable rate due to my current lack of substantial income. 

**Dealership Inventory:**

To make matters worse, I checked the inventory at this dealership, and they don’t have a single vehicle on their lot for less than $11,000. All 6 of the vehicles on their lot under $20,000 are huge, gas guzzling Ford trucks (4) and Honda Pilots (2) with over 150k miles. 

**Savings:**

**I have a 3-month emergency fund at $5500, which I am prepared to put towards auto repairs or a down payment on a replacement vehicle.**

I also have a 401(k) through my former employer. I contributed 6%, plus employer matched contributions of 5.5%, over 10 very long and miserable years of employment. I have not contributed to retirement since I went back to school in 2018. My plan was start contributing again after I graduated and started my new career. Should I pull money out of my 401(k)?

**Finally, I live in Colorado:**

Since last spring, Colorado has suffered alarmingly high rates of auto and catalytic converter theft, specifically affecting Chevrolet, Toyota, Hyundai, Kia, Ford, Dodge, GMC, and Subaru. I have to consider this if I replace the VW. 

If I purchase a replacement vehicle even one year newer than my current vehicle, my taxes, registration, and insurance will increase.",finance

stocks,Amazon is Officially Lobbying on Cannabis,"On June 1, Amazon became the largest and most mainstream company in the world to support the end of federal cannabis prohibition in the United States. 

The company [announced](https://cannabiswire.com/2021/06/08/amazon-human-rights-watch-push-for-more-act-%e2%80%a2-washington-regulators-ok-joints-as-vaccine-incentive-%e2%80%a2-more/) that it would stop drug testing its employees for cannabis use, unless they hold positions under the purview of the Department of Transportation, and that its “public policy team will be actively supporting The Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and Expungement Act of 2021 (MORE Act)—federal legislation that would legalize marijuana at the federal level, expunge criminal records, and invest in impacted communities.”

As of Wednesday, *Cannabis Wire* has found, the company has officially put its lobbying muscle behind these statements. Early Wednesday morning, ​Amazon.com Services LLC [registered](https://lda.senate.gov/filings/public/filing/532894c6-bc65-4e48-b7e9-8c2747fa5426/print/) to lobby, among other topics, on: “Issues related to the Equality Act (H.R. 5 / S. 393), the Justice in Policing Act (H.R. 1280), and marijuana reform, including the MORE Act of 2021 (H.R. 3617).”

The MORE Act was reintroduced in Congress in May, as [*Cannabis Wire* recently reported](https://cannabiswire.com/2021/05/28/more-act-bill-to-end-the-federal-criminalization-of-cannabis-reintroduced-in-congress/). The House passed the previous version of the Act in late 2020, as [*Cannabis Wire* reported at the time](https://cannabiswire.com/2020/12/04/in-historic-vote-us-house-passes-more-act-to-end-the-federal-criminalization-of-cannabis/).  

Cannabis reform advocates have largely shifted their energy toward the Cannabis Administration and Opportunity Act (CAOA), announced this month by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Sens. Cory Booker and Ron Wyden. While both MORE and CAOA would end the federal criminalization of cannabis by removing it from the federal Controlled Substances Act, MORE offers little else in the way of regulation. Conversely, as *Cannabis Wire* [recently reported](https://cannabiswire.com/2021/07/14/sens-schumer-wyden-and-booker-release-most-comprehensive-cannabis-reform-proposal-yet-here-are-the-details/), CAOA is the most comprehensive cannabis reform proposal to-date in Congress. The Senators have also taken the unprecedented approach of releasing a discussion draft of their bill, which provides specific regulatory details, ahead of drafting the final legislation.

*Cannabis Wire* has reached out to Amazon to learn more about its lobbying priorities related to cannabis, and will update the story accordingly.

personalfinance,Pay off 401K LOANS with STUDENT LOANS (Opposite of usual inquiry),"Hey all,

I am a full time student and full time employee with a couple of 401k loans and some federal student loans -  sub and unsub -  I am deciding on for this upcoming semester. Having trouble pinning down their interest rates but my question is...

Does it make sense to take the full loan amounts to repay 401k loans which would increase 401k amount and thus, returns and also would increase my pay each month since it's no longer being deducted?

My thought is that the 401k gains would outweigh the student loan interest (I assume the rates to be less than 6% which is lower than my 401k makes) that will start a few years from now and frankly by the time I start paying on my student loans again (which could really be tomorrow or whenever) I could pay them off quite quickly since I'm already employed full time with a decent salary that will have only gone up in a few years time.

&gt; **Exposed: Congressman Trying to ‘Shut Down’ Cryptocurrency Gets Biggest Donations From Big Banks and Financial Institutions**

https://fee.org/articles/exposed-congressman-trying-to-shut-down-cryptocurrency-gets-biggest-donations-from-big-banks-and-financial-institutions/


&gt; Millions of Americans have bought into forms of digital, decentralized money known as cryptocurrency, valuing its privacy and independence from government meddling. Naturally, politicians in Washington want to rain on the parade and shut down the newfangled currencies— like Bitcoin and Ethereum—that are beyond their control. 
&gt; 
&gt; One of the biggest opponents of cryptocurrency in Washington is Congressman Brad Sherman, a California Democrat who has in the past called for cryptos to be banned. At a Wednesday hearing for the House Committee on Financial Services, Sherman harshly criticized cryptocurrency and renewed his calls for its prohibition.
&gt; 
&gt; Today, during an @FSCDems hearing, I highlighted the threats posed to Americans and the U.S. Financial system by #cryptocurrencies. https://t.co/oPMFEWyePo
&gt; 
&gt; — Rep. Brad Sherman (@BradSherman) June 30, 2021
&gt; “Cryptocurrency is something you can bet on, but if people want to have the animal spirits to take risks, I’d prefer them to invest in equity markets to support the building of American companies, or the California lottery, to support the schools in my state,” Sherman said. “Cryptocurrencies are highly volatile, so if one person makes a million dollars… and nine lose $100,000, Coinbase makes money, the millionaire goes on TV and says how wonderful it is, and nine others do not retire in dignity.” 
&gt; 
&gt; The congressman also claimed that “evading the know-your-customer-rule is the one thing cryptocurrencies have as an advantage to the US dollar.”
&gt; 
&gt; “Cryptocurrencies have the political support of the ‘patriotic’ anarchists who are rooting for tax evasion,” Sherman concluded. “I hope we shut it down.” (Emphasis added). 
&gt; 
&gt; The California congressman gets so much wrong here that it’s difficult to know where to begin.
&gt; 
&gt; For one, Sherman seems to think that his personal views on how to invest money should be superimposed on all Americans. Simply put, the congressman and his Washington pals think they know better, and little people like you or me are too foolish to make these decisions for ourselves. This is not only arrogant but incorrect. 
&gt; 
&gt; You and I have infinitely more knowledge and familiarity with our own financial situation—acceptable levels of risk, investment goals, etc.—than detached politicians and bureaucrats could ever have. It logically follows that we will make better decisions for ourselves than if a top-down, one-size-fits-all approach is crammed down on us from Washington. 
&gt; 
&gt; (I mean, the congressman is telling people they should put their money in the California lottery, and the odds for the “Grand Prize” are about 1 in 41.4 million. We’re supposed to trust his financial advice?) 
&gt; 
&gt; Moreover, Sherman’s rhetoric about a select few cryptocurrency winners getting rich off the backs of losers is a classic example of the “zero-sum fallacy.” It’s economically untrue that wealth gains must necessarily come from someone else’s losses. Indeed, when transactions are voluntary, they must inherently serve both parties' interests. (If they didn’t, the parties wouldn’t agree to it!) So, the picture the congressman paints of cryptocurrency as exploitation is by no stretch of the imagination the reality. People can gain value without others always having to lose. 
&gt; 
&gt; Sherman also misstates the differences between cryptocurrency and the US dollar. He overlooks the key difference: cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are beyond central control, and their price cannot be inflated by a central authority. However, the US dollar can be inflated by the Federal Reserve when it prints new money.  (In fact, that's exactly what's happening right now).
&gt; 
&gt; Why does someone with such dubious and ill-informed views on cryptocurrency want to superimpose his judgment on the entire country via government bans? Well, it’s no doubt due in part to the natural arrogance that plagues humans (especially those who become politicians).
&gt; 
&gt; But there’s also a more cynical, yet simple answer: Some of Congressman Sherman’s biggest donors are big banks and mainstream financial institutions, the same interests threatened by the rise of cryptocurrency.
&gt; 
&gt; According to OpenSecrets.org, the following financial companies rank among Congressman Sherman’s biggest donors to his 2020 Campaign Committee:
&gt; 
&gt; * Capital Group Companies: $18,400
&gt; * Blackstone Group: $16,800
&gt; * BlackRock Inc: $11,250
&gt; * American Bankers Association: $10,000
&gt; * Capital One Financial: $10,000
&gt; * Charles Schwab Corp: $10,000
&gt; * Credit Union National Association: $10,000
&gt; * Discover Financial Services: $10,000
&gt; * Deloitte LLP: $10,000
&gt; 
&gt; This offers some insight into why Sherman persists in seeking to ban cryptocurrency. Sure, such a restriction would deprive his constituents of the freedom to make their own investment decisions and shield their finances from stealth taxation via inflation. But it would serve the interests of Sherman’s biggest donors—and it seems like that’s what really matters to the congressman.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,How to pay back a personal loan?,"When I (now 30) was going to college, my parents paid for my first year, I took out loans for my second year, but for the last 2 years, the loans I was offered were incredibly high interest rates, so my parents paid the tuition out of their retirement fund, with the expectation that I would pay them back. The interest rate they put on the loan is low (3%). The total amount I owe them is now just over 100k, and I finally have a job where I can start to repay them. However, my father is now having medical issues, so they don’t want the money under his name in any way in case he needs care we cannot afford, and they seize his accounts to pay. So my question is: what is the best way to set aside money for them? Open another savings account and just deposit money into it? Place the funds into a shorter term investment with a bank? Invest it into stock? And when it comes time to give it to them, is there a way to do it to avoid taxes as it was a personal loan?",finance
personalfinance,Update to high closing cost and high interest rate situation,"[Previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/onoo03/closing_cost_estimate_is_double_what_was_expected/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)

Thank you to everyone on that post who replied with advice and suggestions. The consensus was that $14,000 in closing costs on a 160,000 loan was ridiculous, as was the 4.5% interest rate. Lots of people also had not so great experiences with Navy Federal. Was panicking because I am under contract.

The next day, I reached out to another lender, this one local, that I had previously had a preapproval from for an FHA. He called me first thing in the morning, and was able to get me a conventional 97 loan with 3% down, low PMI, 3.5% interest, and $7000 in closing costs. MUCH better deal, and I walked away from NFCU. The new lender team has been incredible, so responsive and fast tracking everything.

Lesson learned! Even when you’re under contract, you can switch lenders (didn’t know that). Read the loan estimate with a fine toothed comb, and ask others if you’re getting a fair deal.

stocks,Reduce exposure for upcoming correction,"Hello,

I just wanted to remind people before the bloodbath that is coming down the pipe do your best to diversify and reduce exposure to certain frothy sectors of the market. It's highly probable there will be a correction within the next 12 months. Big investors like Bill Ackman are selling more than buying the same with Buffett they often leave clues before a crash. Berkshire Hathaway is sat on over $150 billion in cash ready to buy up stocks. I would also listen to Michael Bury. He's always laughed at but often gets it right.

Anyway, that's just my humble advice. Most retail traders who onboarded after March 2020 will be wiped out in this next crash I guarantee it. I'm predicting the EV sector will never get back to its current heights and will be like a dot com bubble type reset where most of the stocks just go to penny stocks and never return. 

The way to survive any crash is having cash on the side. Diversifying. Investing in stuff with a dividend is nice as at least they pay you to hold the bag. If you're buying stocks now at an all-time high RIP.

I could be wrong but this is investing. I just use probabilities. The probabilities of a crash coming soon are very very high. The further the market goes from reality the more probable it becomes. Interest rates will likely be the cause but it will probably happen before them. They don't make it that easy to time these things.

Kind Regards

personalfinance,Retirement withdrawal mix traditional and roth,"I've been trying to confirm info, but the search parameters are bringing up the wrong information. While I am in my 30's (Lets say 34.5 for math reasons) making around $100K - in the USA (Illinois 4.95% tax rate) - I am trying to plan for my eventual retirement. My job only offers a traditional 401K, and prior to that I was funding a traditional IRA. My plan is to mix in a roth IRA now since my job offers the traditional 401K. I want to make sure I understand the math correctly. Assume I'm single and don't care about inheritance for this scenario.

&amp;#x200B;

If I were 59.5 now and wanted to retire and had (using simple way too low numbers here) $100K in a traditional 401K. And I had $100K in a Roth IRA. Assuming I have no other source of income - If I wanted to withdraw  $9,875 from my traditional 401K I would be paying  $987.5 in FEDERAL taxes (10% rate) plus whatever the state tax is. And I can take as much as I want from the Roth with no effect on taxes at all, right? And if I have any additional source of income it will immediately jump into the 12% tax bracket up to  $40,125? (including the first $9,875.)

&amp;#x200B;

So since all the math is percentages... Mainly the thing that matters is the tax percentages in the brackets at time of earning and withdrawal? Whatever keeps you in lower tax brackets whether it's now or later - that's what makes the difference on the withdrawal side? So this mainly matters if you intend to retire with a higher withdrawal rate or the tax brackets change against your favor.

&amp;#x200B;

Am I understanding this correctly and does my math generally make sense? I'm about the furthest thing from an accountant and I've been staring at numbers for too long so my brain is mush. I just want to get this straight so I don't have to think about it again.",finance
personalfinance,Worrying About College,"I live in Missouri, and I am going to the University of Pittsburgh for college. I’m a low-income student, so I’ve received a grand total of $38,346.00 in financial aid. With the estimate of my cost of attendance I was provided before I submitted my enrollment deposit, the difference would’ve been manageable. However, my cost of attendance increased from the estimate by ~$4,000.00, so my total cost of attendance sits at $49,846.00, which makes the difference $11,500.00 for a full year which is out of my reach.
I’ve already emailed the financial aid office at my college and am filling out applications, but I am extremely worried about how I am actually going to pay for this. I have $3,904.00 in savings and not much else. I plan to get a job on campus, but I doubt that I will make enough to pay off the difference. However, I am reluctant to get a private loan for this amount with an exorbitant interest rate. I am in a pickle, and I would appreciate some advice on what to do, if anybody has it. Thank you.",finance

retirement,Husband Miserable with Job,"My 57 yo husband is miserable in his education job. We have $2,250,000 in savings. Two kids - ages 16 and 18 - college funds are $300,000 (not part of our 2,250,000). Kids in state schools so I think we’re good with affording tuition. If he retires now instead of two years from now, we are hit with a pension reduction. He will only get about 45k a year in pension benefits. Good news is that we get health insurance through his contract.

CryptoCurrency,Wallet,"So, just out the gate, I want to start by saying I’m not an expert in all things crypto, so please, don’t hound me and call me an idiot.

Long story short, I have most of my small crypto holding in the Celsius Wallet, and after hearing some horror stories on this sub about withdrawals being locked, I want to switch. 

What originally drew me to Celsius was the high annual interest rates, with weekly payments which really compounded quickly.  The interface is also pretty good, but I mean, that’s not worth too much now as I want to become more serious about my crypto holdings.

I’m looking to move my long-term holdings elsewhere and really make some good returns, whether it’s in the forms of a savings account, or staking coins. Essentially, I’m looking for crypto wallet options.

I’ve heard Nexo is a good option, what do the rest of you think? I’m not particularly interested in hard wallets, even though I know they’re the most secured, simply because I don’t have much and I want to earn interest on my holdings.

vet,Puppy I'm fostering has developed a bunch of rashes. The rescue's vet has been kind of dismissive and not alarmed. What do I do?,"[Pics of the Puppy](https://imgur.com/a/A4mA1Wj)

I started fostering a lovely puppy over a month ago for a rescue group in Los Angeles that takes in strays and small pets at kill shelters. They have a very small set up, and it's basically run by a few volunteers (extremely understaffed). The puppy was doing great at my house for the first month. Very happy and very spoiled with attention and care. Out of the blue over these past 7 days, she's been developing these sores all over her body. I brought her in immediately when she just had 2 small sores at the start, and the vet tech they had on staff did a quick 30 second ring worm test. She told me it was negative for ringworm and informed to just spray some hydrogen peroxide on her and it should go away. Next day, she developed more sores, then even more the next day. I updated the rescue each day. I brought her in again to leave her there for a few days so they could monitor her. They texted me that everything was fine and for me to pick her up. When I got there today, her paws/legs, whiskers/chin, and belly had even more sores. I told this to the vet tech. She told me it's not contagious, and it's probably just allergies and her body will fight it off and recover. She told me if its a problem, I could rub neosporin on the sores.

I'm nervous because after a month of searching for people to adopt her, I finally found 2 families that were interested in meeting her. However, she now looks diseased and I'm scared it's going to hurt her chances of getting adopted. I'm thinking about rescheduling the meeting until the sores heal up, but I'm also worried they will just look elsewhere or the sores will continue to get worse. I'm also nervous that the vet tech didn't really give a thorough examination and only checked for ring worms. She didn't inform me that the puppy had developed more sores while in their care. I really don't have the means to take her to another vet for a second opinion which is why I'm fostering. I don't know what to do and I feel helpless.

More info: The week prior, I took her to a highly rated pet salon to bathe her and treat her shedding (I paid out of pocket). I washed her bed and blankets. She hunted and killed a squirrel in the backyard. I told all this to the rescue incase it might have given them an answer.

What should I do?

TL;DR; Foster puppy developing sores all over. The rescue I got her from seems to be dismissive and not alarmed by the sores.",cryptocurrency

Let's go...

Newly covered today: 

1. Cardano didn’t come up in the Cathie Wood, Jack Dorsey, and Elon Musk panel discussion at “The B Word” event. But, given how Elon repeatedly shot down maximalist explanations for the shortcomings of proof-of-work chains in energy consumption and throughput, the whole thing ended up sounding like a long-form pitch for proof-of-stake and Cardano.

3. Gary Gensler, SEC Chair, indicates that crypto assets providing synthetic exposure to securities will be regulated as securities.

2. Vitalik is saying it’s highly unlikely we see ETH 2.0 before late 2022. I’m guessing that means mid 2023 which will be after two years of Cardano slaughtering the entire ETH user base. Things are looking so bad that Vitalik says he doesn’t even like using the ETH 2.0 label anymore since he knows the changes will be more incremental. This is what early capitulation sounds like guys.

28. It looks like the second biggest ETH stakepool or it's custody provider has lost it’s users private keys to $75MM in ETH. Cardano doesn’t have this problem.

31. The June Cardano 360 is currently available on Youtube. [https://youtu.be/al5m14299ww](https://youtu.be/al5m14299ww)
32. We saw segments on various newer partner entities like Nervos, Orion Protocol, and Revuto. Nervos is a UTXO proof-of-work blockchain which is building a cross-chain bridge with Cardano so that you can use your ADA on Nervos dApps and vice versa. Interoperability is a big theme for Nervos and they plan to have a working testnet within a month. Orion Protocol is building a terminal that will allow for decentralized non-custodial trading across centralized and decentralized exchanges. They say this would not require you to KYC or even have an account with any of these exchanges. Revuto is an online subscription management service that recently completed a $10MM token sale on Cardano.
33. It was also revealed that Wolfram Labs, COTI, and IOHK have a three-way partnership (a ménage à tech) to build an NFT auction site. The people from Wolfram were talking about very interesting things including live minting during streaming events and automated upload to IPFS. COTI will be building out auction and bidding mechanisms in ADAPay.
34. Professor Aggelos Kiayias gave us an update on research including that Ouroboros Chronos and Hydra papers have both been accepted into conferences/journals. Chronos will provide Cardano with a global concept of time that doesn’t rely on any outside timekeeper. Prof. Kiayias also pointed out that Hydra is distinguishable from other layer two protocols in that the scripting language is identical to that of the base layer in Cardano such that any dApp that can run on Cardano will run on the Hydra L2. This is a huge plus and superior to many other layer two solutions in other ecosystems where the base layer dApps will not run on layer two. Finally, the Mithril paper has been submitted for peer review. It will provide Cardano light wallets with Succinct Non-interactive Arguments of Knowledge that will give us the best of both worlds: no delays for syncing as in full node wallets while still preserving trustlessness.
35. Finally, the Goguen Summit will be in late September. Sign up now at [summit.cardano.org](http://summit.cardano.org/).
36. The Fed is once again STRONGLY signalling to us that they are going to regulate stablecoins. The Fed is also specifically calling out Tether for the first time. You need to be thinking about how stablecoin regulation might affect your favorite Cardano DeFi or other project.

37. People are starting to realize that the Stakehound private key loss in ETH may attract unwanted regulatory attention to Ethereum 2.0 while this problem could never have occurred in Cardano. Also, only a few days later another ETH stakepool (this time SharedStake...the sixth biggest ETH Stakepool) allegedly experiences a rugpull that some are valuing at over $30MM. This is another problem that could not happen in Cardano staking. It feels like we stepped into the ring, they rang the bell, and ETH just started punching itself in the head. Eventually it’s going to KO itself.

The article contains some very interesting discussion on smart contracts in the EUTXO context including language instructing that “UTXOs have smart contracts attached to them and not the other way around” and “\[...\]the simplest way to think about it is that when a UTXO is created it has the option to have a smart contract attached to it.” [https://medium.com/dcspark/every-eutxo-dapp-will-use-nfts-and-heres-why-fd87e6a8c9a6](https://medium.com/dcspark/every-eutxo-dapp-will-use-nfts-and-heres-why-fd87e6a8c9a6)

98. Notable news for upcoming Cardano DeFi projects. There may be slightly less competition in the “get a return on your crypto assets” game very soon. The New Jersey AG’s office has delivered a cease and desist letter to BlockFi. The AG’s press release cited BlockFi’s interest bearing deposit accounts as unregistered securities and also mentioned the lack of FDIC or SPIC insurance for it’s depositors.  This leaves some lingering questions for Cardano DeFi projects that might be planning to accept deposits or other transfers of value and offering a return of sorts.  You could argue that these projects are decentralized where BlockFi was not. But, the AG’s press release seems to cite decentralization as one of the risks of DeFi projects. Also, as a practical matter, there is a question whether decentralization will be a good shield from regulators since many of these projects have companies and real humans with faces and names behind them unlike a truly anonymous founder such as Satoshi Nakamoto.

personalfinance,Legal consumer rights/protection when Bank of America refuses to acknowledge fraud,"Basically, I found two large and suspicious charges by Staples and Home Depot one morning and reported them to Bank of America. 

Important facts: I had never stepped foot in either of those stores in the past 6 months. The card was in my wallet the entire time. No one else could have taken the card and put it back. During the time window that the transactions were made, I was working from home. The last statement could be sworn and attested not only by me but also my girlfriend/roommate. 

Despite me telling them this, BoA didn't trust me and denied my claim (twice) with this reasoning:

&gt;We confirmed your card was used for the charge(s). The chip was read, your PIN was entered, and/or you signed for the merchandise or service, which indicates you or someone you allowed to use your card was present

I don't know the details of how the perpetrator actually pulled off this fraud; it sure is scary to know it's possible.   
I know the chip is supposed to not be able to be copied... yet here I am. It's possible that the protocols surrounding the chip are not properly implemented and potentially have flaws which make them vulnerable to compromised point-of-sale terminals. 

Regardless, what are the legal rights/protections that I as a consumer have from the FTC? By federal law, the maximum responsibility for unauthorized charges is $50 provided you report it promptly (which I did).

But how does the law handle it if you claim it's unauthorized but your bank is claiming they are authorized? Will I have to sue them or will they sue me?

I already complained to the CFPB and they reiterated the same exact thing in their response. Suggestions on dealing with this nightmare are welcome.",finance

dogecoin,doge story - part I,"**LAST NIGHT**

The sun had set before Elon Musk sent the inspirational CyberViking tweet. Stars were out and the moonlight shimmered on the rain-wet street in the leafy suburb. Nice. 

A doge could be heard barking from behind a fence. Not a bark to ward of potential perpetrators but a bark to welcome the familiar sight of the Shibu-Unit drop-off plane overhead. Such wow.

From the belly of the plane, dressed in black attire and carrying slim backpacks, the hatch opened up between Paul and Sheena. Wind rushed in and flung Sheena’s hair about as Paul did is best to remain calm with heavier breathing. Paul was a Shibe in training, Diamond hodling for only 5-weeks while Sheena was a 3-month decorated Diamond. They looked down on the rooves below and when the playpark came in view, Sheena looked to Paul,

“Are you ready?”

It was his first mission and Paul stretched by rotating his shoulders. Adjusting his utility belt he replied,

“Yes.” He noticed how she kept looking at him as if he were speaking another language. Recollection of his training flashed to mind and he corrected himself, “Much yes.”

“Nice,” Sheena nodded as she went down on one knee. “Now, come this side and climb on my back.” After Paul walked round the open hatch and attached himself to her back, Sheena said, “Hold on tight. Much wow.”

“Much wow,” Paul replied, though he was clenching his jaw.

The Shibes dived down from the two mile height, allowing the plane to close its hatch and circle back to base. Sheena smashed the button that released the glider wings. Their downward trajectory pivoted up and Sheena leaned sideways. They aimed for the merry-go-round. Landing on one of the merry-go-round’s radius rails, momentum was transferred into rotational motion. Paul puked a little as Sheena stuck out her boot to grind against the grass.

Walking down the street, Sheena checked her wrist. Her watch displayed the direction towards the paperhand’s residence. It was nearby and she was glad that the coordinates were accurate this time. Paul asked,

“This is so interesting. I can’t believe I’ve already got a mission. And to join you, in Unit-69. Wow.”

Sheena sighed, wondering why he couldn’t stick to the mission-language. She responded anyway, understanding that habits require time and routine correction. “It’s not ‘so interesting’. It’s ‘Such Interest’. And this isn’t ‘wow’, it’s ‘Much Wow’. Besides that, you coming along just shows how much we’re in need of reinforcements. The value of Dogecoin is in dangerous territory and Paperhands are scalping all forms of momentum as Doge popularity is growing. We need you, the newer diamonds, now more than ever in Unit-69.”

“Much sad,” Paul nodded. 

As they walked a dog from behind the living room window barked at them. Greeting the familiar scent of the Shibu-Unit. It made Sheena smile and clarify, “With the increase in support comes an equal increase in resistance.”

“Much sad,” Paul repeated, narrowing his eyes to add, “Stoopid paperhands.” 

The residence came into view as Sheena checked to confirm the address on her wrist display. It had a low wall edging the front lawn with a wooden gate. A pathway led to the front door. Walls were painted white and the windows to the kitchen and lounge had slit venetian blinds. The house number and street name matched what the control center had sent. There had been mistakes before. Mistaken accusations when surveillance directed them to the residences of investors who needed to sell for Much-Wow reasons, or when they picked up unimportant SHIB paperhands. Because of these instances, Sheena insisted that coordinates be double-checked by Sebastian. He was a market-watcher with six months experience. Tracing wallet addresses with purchases, package and food deliveries; he was a professional who never jumped to the fist conclusion. Address identification required at least 6.9/10 coincidence-matching before he submitted the coordinates. Sheena trusted his direction. 

Despite the trouble taken to ensure that the supplied address contained the living space of an identified Paperhand Dogecoin trader; there was another reason to trust that this address was correct. It would be this Paperhand’s second visit. Henry, a 4-month Diamond Hand Shibe, had visited this Paperhand not too long ago. A record of this was kept on the mission blockchain.

“Before we go in,” Sheena began. “Tell me, what are you going to say to this Paperhand?”

Paul rubbed his hands together, recollecting his training and mission instructions. He then stood sideways, pointed his finger and exclaimed, “Take your hands out the cookie jar!”

He understood the philosophy, Sheena thought to herself. Although it was nearly impossible to recreate the real situation in a simulation, the Neuralink systems at Control Base were impressive. Taking less time than ever before, trainees could react to a simulated situation while Neuralink would reinforce the desired behaviours and attitude required. There was a fine line between accusations of a legal or illegal kind. So when it came to making accusations over legal actions, such as day-trading with volumes of Dogecoin; the accusation required a bit more of an emotional edge rather than a logical rendering of existing laws. As such, pleased with Paul’s stance, Sheena. “Okay. Follow me. Much wow.”

“Much wow.”

There was no dog at this residence, a typical scenario. However, Sheena and Paul still kept quite as they crept over the low wall of the perimeter. Sneaking across the lawn, they backed up against the wall of the house where Sheena released the grappling hook from her utility belt. She flung it to wrap around a nearby branch, providing sufficient leverage. “You’re okay to follow?”

“Yes,” Paul nodded, having been trained in grappling-hook ascents only a week before. However, unable to excuse too many occasions of non-mission speak, Sheena waited. He clicked. “Much yes.”

Satisfied, Sheena pushed the recoil button and sailed up. Once settled on the branch, a few deft leaps took her onto the Paperhand’s rooftop. She waited there, not willing to look around to see Paul’s progress but kept her ears keen. She heard a few scrambling, scratching sounds, followed by ‘Such-oof’ and a groan as she envisioned him clutching on the roof tiles to pull himself up. He whispered, “Much wow,” so Sheena continued stepping lightly towards the skylight. 

Standing on opposite sides of the skylight, as with the hatch when they were in the drop-off plane, Sheena noted that the frame was superglued along the cracked edges. Looking up to Paul, she whispered, 

“Don’t be like Henry.” Pointing to the previous destructive entry point, she clarified, “Not wow.” 

“Much damage and very unnecessary,” Paul replied in acceptable mission-language.

Lowering herself for a better view of the room below, Sheena asked, “Do you see?” It had a floor space of 7x8 meters and was carpeted. Cupboards on one side while a man in his late 30’s sat at a desk. He had dirty blond hair, chubby and was focused on two monitors before him. “Henry labelled him as Stu, and said that he has a Not-Wow temperament.”

“All Paperhands are Not-Wow,” Paul replied, baring his teeth in a newbie-Shibe manner. It was cute, pleasing Sheena, who whispered, 

“Now, much listen.” 

Mimicking his superior, Paul placed his ear close to the glass and listened for the activity within. 

“Stu! Come to bed, it’s late.” A woman’s voice sounded from a different room. Stu didn’t respond, focused on the candlestick graphs on the monitors. A few moments later, “Stu, please!”

“Not now!” Stu shouted. Then, in a softer voice, “These hopeful retards are just getting excited. Got my buy-in just as Musk sent his tweet. Stupid suckers are loving my volume. Come, you stupid suckers. Get into the hype. Make me some glorious fiat, ha-ha!”

“Not wow, indeed,” Paul whispered.

Sheena’s eyes narrowed on the Paperhand below, feeling the saltiness in her body build up on her teeth. Noticing her own not-wow emotion, she looked to Paul. “Much indeed, yes. But we must remain Shibe.” Paul nodded as excitement pumped his heart faster. He wanted to break through the skylight that very moment, until she placed her hand on his shoulder. “Follow me. Don’t get carried away. We follow protocol. Much-wow obedience training.”

Paul nodded, keeping his adrenaline in check.

From her utility belt Sheena took out a handheld pneumatic crowbar, connected to a gas canister on her hip. With the edge pushed into the groove, a slight shove permitted gas to ripple along the sealed liner – separating the lid from the base. A few more, quieter, prods of the crowbar placed strain on latch. “Paying much attention?” She asked?

“Much.”

The crowbar was then jimmied, much quiet, towards the latch wherein the gas was released. The force of the air hissed against the small mechanical edges. Stu didn’t appear to hear anything, until the buildup of compressed between the mechanical edges parted ways. A loud click caught Stu’s attention and he tilted his head back. Eyes widened as memory from a previous break-in flooded his mind of two Shibes coming down on top of him above. “No!” He exclaimed, though his voice was trapped within a terrified constriction of his airways. 

Pulling back the lid of the skylight, with the frame kept intact besides the slight strain on the hinges, Sheena hopped down onto the floor below. Not on top of Stu as Henry (and his sidekick, Kiev) had done before. Paul copied the motion, landing beside Sheena.

“Hands up,” Sheena exclaimed, standing sideways and pointing her finger. Her eyes glared at him from a Diamond moral high-ground, but Stu was still petrified from shock. She thus took hold of his backrest and swiveled his chair around so that they could face the Paperhand. Pulling him away from his day-trading station. 

Stu’s wife called out from an adjacent room, “Stu! What’s happening?”

Mimicking his superior’s stance, Paul stood sideways as well and pointed his finger,

“Paperhand. You’ve been warned.”

As if the sudden break-in wasn’t followed by a physical assault, Stu’s pale face started flooding with blood. Red-faced, he shouted at them, “You! You have no right!”

Feeling emboldened, wanting nothing more than to impress Sheena, Paul said,

“You dirty paperhand!” He then wagged his finger in a condescending manner. “Why are you killing momentum and causing panic, huh?”

Swiveling his chair towards Paul, Stu then swiveled back to Sheena who had stepped away to open the door. Done so for his wife to join them and understand the reason for the intrusion. Reinstating a stance of Diamond moral-superiority, lags apart and hands on her hips, Sheena asked,

“Weren’t you already warned?”

“I’m going to call the police! You have no right!” Stu retorted, startled as cognitive dissonance hindered his speech. Dissonance caused by profiting from non-taxed currency, while still relying on tax-paid police enforcement to protect him.

“Do you need another biff on the nose?” Sheena warned. Turning to Paul, “You’ve had training on this, yes?”

“Much yes,” Paul nodded. He stepped close to Stu and held up palm-facing hand. Stu backed away on the roller wheels of his chair, hitting his desk. Taking a step closer, Paul elucidated the offender, “I’ve completed Biff-course with a full much-wow. A quick, soft tap, stopping short of cartilage dislocation. Sufficient enough to produce a discomfort, aimed at releasing pressure from the tear ducts.”

“What’s going on?” A woman appeared at the door, wearing her nightgown. “Oh!” She recognized the Shibu-Unit from their 69-design Night-ops black attire. Folding her arms she looked at her husband. “Have you been paper-hand’ing the Doge again?” 

As Paul kept his palm a short, threatening distance from Stu’s nose, ready to biff; Sheena addressed the Paperhand, 

“Now, Henry was here. Do you remember? You wife seems to remember. According to the blockchain record, you’ve been buying up the rocket-fuel momentum and selling high volumes at stabilization plateaus since the 5c-mark. Correct?”

“He might be a new Doge paperhand,” Paul remarked, hand twitching to biff. “But he’s probably been dipping his hand in plenty of other cookie jars. A practiced momentum-killer. Isn’t that right, Paperhand?” 

Head shaking as his own moral high-ground took shape, Stu countered, “It’s a free market!” He gripped the armrests. Dissonance evaporated when he realized that he wouldn’t need to call the tax-paid police, and that he could simply rely on the Paperhand Charter. “There’s no shame in making profit!” 

Sheena looked to his wife, “My name is Sheena. This is Paul.”

“Nice to meet you,” Stu’s wife greeted them. “I’m Nordine. And I’m sorry about this. Looks like he can’t help himself.”

Facing the Paperhand again, Sheena declared, “It appears that you’ve been accumulating volume by contributing to quite a few pump schemes, and then dumping the Dogecoins as new investors climb onboard. You were part of the April 20th sell-off, which left many new Shibes stranded around 42c. Do you know the damage you continue to cause? The amount of uncertainty you cause just so you can make a little personal profit?” 

Adding to the accusation, Nordine said, “You promised to leave the Dogecoins alone. So we, as many people around the world, can collectively have and contribute to a nice savings plan.”

“I NEVER said that!” Stu shot back. Paul biffed his nose. “Agh! Don’t do that!” Paul biffed him again and the corners of his eyes reddened. Tears formed, irritating him as he covered his nose. Looking to the intruding Shibes, “Long-term investment in Doge is stupid!”

Nordine sighed. “I was hoping he’d be a diamond after the last time your team came to visit.”

Furious by his wife’s betrayal, Stu swiveled between the three of them. “Buying low and selling high is what makes this fun! Why would you actually want to invest in this?”

“Biff him again, Paul,” Sheena requested.

Stu was still covering his nose and evaded Paul’s hand by moving his head side-to-side. Unable to locate a good angle for a light tap, Paul reverted to the backup action. He gave smacked Stu on the top of his head.

“Aagh!” Stu recoiled. “Don’t do that!”

“It might be fun, I guess,” Sheena confirmed. “But you’ve been overdoing it, haven’t you? Large volumes and done quite frequently. We see this as predatory.”

Stu’s wife shook her head. “He can’t help himself.”

“We’re going to the moon, Stu,” Sheena explained again. “And you’re making it difficult every time you scalp our rocket fuel.”

“It’ll never get to $1!” Stu blurted, hands striking his armrests. Paul biffed him on the nose again. “Stop that!”

“I’m so sorry about him,” Stu’s wife tried to excuse him. 

“We understand,” Sheena replied, extending a hand on her shoulder. “Now that we’ve confirmed…” She then noticed Stu having swiveled around to the monitors. Seeing the green candlestick growing and touching a sell-wall created by the Paperhand Hive-mind. He was getting ready to sell. “Paul?”

Nodding his head, Paul recalled the objective of the visit – being the second one which this Paperhands had received. From his utility belt, in the Much-Wow Moonbag, Paul took out a collar and (with deft motion) wrapped it around Stu’s neck. 

“What’s this?” Stu asked, keeping one eye on the growing, green candlestick. He then felt a zap. “Ah! What did you… Argh!”

Seeing Stu’s wife gasp, Sheena consoled her. “It’s just a little spark. High-impedance equal to the epidermis. High voltage but no amperage. The circuitry is logic-based to find verified brainwave patterns that reflect greedy pump-dump sales. It ignores selling for Much-Wow purposes. Those patterns which include intentions to purchase items which Dogecoin can’t yet procure.” 

“You’re shocking me?!” Stu alarmed. “You can’t do this!”

Repeating what Sheena had said to Nordine, Paul said, “It’s a device that monitors the signals from the brain to body. There’s a specific pattern that happens when people get excited from selling. There’s an even more specific signal pattern for getting excited to sell Dogecoin. The collar’s logic then looks for patterns associated with intended purchases, but if none are found, then the assumption is that selling was simply intended to scalp momentum. That’s when the shock happens.”

Twisting her mouth, Nordine asked, “Do you think it’ll help him become more diamond?”

“It’ll help,” Paul said. “I’m told that many Paperhands have managed to stop themselves from daily and weekly scalping after wearing the collar for just a month. Much wow.” 

“This is inhumane!” Stu countered. “It’s a buying-selling market. Argh!” He got zapped. “This isn’t meant to be taken seriously!”

“However,” Sheena cautioned, following Paul’s positive statement. “There have been others who apparently get such a thrill out of scalping Dogecoin that a shock isn’t enough. Not wow.”

“What happens then?” Nordine asked. “Is there a chance he’ll always be a Paperhands?”

“We’ll see how this goes,” Paul said in a casually threatening tone. “We don’t want to have to put him down.”

“What?!” Stu blurted, and repeated. “You can’t do this! You’re actively torturing people for making money!”

“We just have,” Sheena corrected him. “And the ‘torture’, as you call it, is simply being returned.”

“But I’m not the only one,” he complained. “Do you think you can actually find and stop everyone from pump-dumping Dogecoin? You’ll never stop the hype-inflation, and Doge will never get to a… Argh! Ouch!”

“Never get to a… what?” Paul teased.

“Argh!” The collar zapped Stu again.

“Well,” Sheena addressed Nordine. “Our work is done. For now. Hopefully our Control Base will see Stu’s wallet not buying and selling too much Doge in short intervals. We’ll see how it goes between tonight and in three weeks. Try and help him to keep his hands out of the cookie jar, if you know what we mean.”

“Thank you, Shibu Unit-69,” Nordine said. “Please, let me walk you out. Next time, and I hope there isn’t a next time, please feel free to come through the front door.”

Paul ruffled Stu’s hair and then followed Sheena and Nordine. “Using the front door isn’t as Much Wow, I’m afraid.”

“Windows and skylights,” Sheena confirmed as they reached the front door.

“You know,” Nordine began, as she opened the door and crossed the threshold. “I’ve been hoping to pay our son’s tuition. That’s probably why Stu can’t, as you put it, ‘keep picking his hand in the cookie jar’.”

“We understand,” Sheena shrugged. “Many are blind to see what can be accomplished as a global collective. Or they inherently don’t trust others, and thus become the same untrusted individuals. For this reason, they focus on quick gains based on daily and weekly percentages. They lose sight of the possibilities that can be achieved.” Hearing herself explain it the way she had, Sheena sighed. “Hopefully the collar works. Soon as the Paperhands hodl longer, become a little harder, become more diamond; we’ll see Doge rise consistently and gradually. We’ll attract more investment, and soon enough we’ll all see each other’s Much Wow become real. Stu could then sell when you have enough money to pay the tuition. Instead of accumulating little-by-little, dissuading others from investing and encouraging newer Shibes to panic-sell.”

“Yes. Much Wow. I’ll keep an eye on him,” Nordine smiled. 

Sheena and Paul walked back up to the playpark as the moths and fireflies danced around the cones of the streetlights. Having just updated the mission report on Stu’s file, Sheena left the voice recording, “Mission accomplished. Doge = doge”. She then turned to Paul. “You did well. Much Wow. Your biff is good, and you attached the collar nicely. Much impressed.”

“Thank you!” He beamed just as they rounded a corner. Up ahead, he spotted a couple of buttoned-up suits walking up the pathway to someone’s front door. One with red hair and another with blonde hair. “Oh, look.”

Even though flashdrive-sized cold storage devices are quite small, compact; Sheena and Paul could see one of the suits holding it out in front of him. As if prematurely handing it over to a recipient. The Shibu-Unit 69 knew exactly who they were.

“Let’s walk up quietly,” Sheena suggested. “Hide behind those bushes. I want to hear what they’re saying these days.”

They managed to successfully position themselves behind a hedge. Without being noticed, they heard the doorbell being rung three times, and then saw a large, bald man appear from the opened door. Standing in his socks and a bathrobe, he looked displeased. “Do you know what time it is?!” He asked them. 

“Yes sir,” replied the suit with the cropped red hair.

“This will only take a moment,” the blonde suit added.

Whispering to Sheena, Paul stated, “That blonde suit looks like Barry Silbert, doesn’t he?”

Sheena raised an eyebrow. “Remarkably similar.”

The Barry Silbert-lookalike stepped sideways to create a circle between himself, his red-haired companion and the prospective customer. “We believe you’ve sold some of your Bitcoin. Is that right?”

Sheena whispered to Paul, “This is so embarrassing.”

“Not wow,” Paul shook his head.

“What business is that of yours?” The half-dressed man declared.

“Well,” the cropped-hair suit began. “Do you know that there are only 21 million bitcoins?”

Pointing to his companion’s hand, holding the cold storage device, the Barry Silbert-lookalike added, “And Bitcoin is the first cryptocurrency. Created by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009. No one knows who Satoshi is, but we all agree that we are all Satoshi. Even you, sir, are Satoshi.”

The bald man furrowed his brows, and the cropped suit applied the next layer of the elevator pitch,

“Bitcoin has proven itself to be a market leader for over 10 years. It truly is the modern era’s digital gold.”

The Barry Silbert-lookalike added an additional layer. “In fact, it’s better than gold. Am I right, Dennis?”

“You most certainly are, Barry,” Dennis confirmed, surprising Sheena and Paul when he called the Barry-lookalike ‘Barry’. Strange coincidence. “It is scarce, like gold. But it’s also versatile, which gold is not. Should we inform this gentleman about many uses of Bitcoin? Perhaps even the Lightning network?”

“We certainly should!” Barry concurred. As Dennis moved the cold storage closer to the resident, Barry said, “But first, you should buy back your Bitcoin then transfer it to a safe place. Like this device, right here.”

“This is getting far too cringe for me,” Sheena whispered to Paul. “Let’s just go.”

“Such boring,” Paul agreed. 

As the Shibu-Unit 69 straightened themselves, ready to leave, they overheard the man shout, “Not interested!” and slam the door. 

They arrived at the playpark, walking to the merry-go-round. With much irony, Paul asked, “Can I ask you something?”

“Sure,” Sheena said as she retrieved the grappling hook from her utility belt. She then wrapped it around one of the rails. 

“Are you seeing anyone?”

“Come here and hold,” Sheena requested, indicating the grapple which realistically didn’t need additional support. 

Knowing this, Paul complied by merely holding the rail of the merry-go-round as Sheena walked away backwards. Once she reached a decent distance, she said, “Okay. You can let go and join me here. Looks like it’ll hold.” She however noted his languid motion, despondent by his earlier question being ignored. “How did you do in your training on this? Using a merry-go-round to propel you upwards?”

“I did okay,” he shrugged. Making another attempt, he asked, “So, are you seeing anyone?”

Still uncertain how to respond, Sheena pushed the recoil button. The grappling hook released itself and sprang back towards her, causing the merry-go-round to spin around rapidly. 

“Are you asking me out on a date?” She asked. Then quickly followed up that question with something unrelated. “Did you test your equipment before we left?”

Paul pushed another button on his utility belt and drone-propellers emerged from the sides of his slim backpack. They started spinning immediately. Powerful enough that he had to lean against the force or else he would’ve been pushed off his feet. He then pushed the button again which stopped the propulsion and pulled the propellers back into his backpack. “Do you want to go on a date?”

Looking at her wrist, she saw that the drop-off plane would arrive shortly overhead. “Let’s go!”

They ran to the spinning merry-go-round and jumped on a rail. Holding tight, Sheena spoke through the rushing air. “Aim for the see-saw.” 

Sheena was first to push the button, releasing the drone-propellers, and leap towards the see-saw. In midair she pulled herself backwards, chest pointing to the sky and she flew upwards. Right behind her, Paul came flying upwards and asked again,

“Are you willing to go on a date?”

Their quick ascent passed 200 feet when Sheena replied,

“You know I can’t date anyone who hasn’t hodl’ed as long as I have.”

The drop-off plane flew up from the left and its belly hatch opened up. A rope dropped down for the Shibu Unit to aim towards. Having passed 700 feet, Paul responded,

“But I hodl a lot. You know how much Dogecoin I have?”

At 1200ft Sheena replied, “Doesn’t matter.” The rope from the plane dragged across the sky, with only a small weight to keep it taught. At 1700ft she added, “Even Stu has a large volume of Dogecoin. How long you can hodl matters more than how much you’re hodling.”

She grabbed onto the rope first, soon followed by Paul who grabbed it right below her. Both began to climb up and Paul said,

“But I suppose, after a year. In a year’s time, we would both say that we hodl’ed for about the same time?”

Near the top, Sheena responded,

“If we’re both still hodling alone in a year’s time, I’ll consider it.”

That made Paul smile, but then he frowned as he wondered what he’d do for a whole year. 

As they both entered into the plane’s belly and began pulling up the rope, Sheena’s wrist blinked. An incoming message sounded, 

“Well done, Unit-69. Such Wow. Appears that Stu hasn’t acted on any urges to devalue the Doge since you left the residence.”

“Thanks, Sebastian.” Sheena responded in a reply voice-note, speaking over the air rushing round the fuselage. “What’s the situation?”

“Another mission?” Paul asked.

“Panic-selling not too far away. Can be a more sensitive case, affected by fud on the news. It dipped, and they sold, and they bought back when it rose up again. Not a lot of Doge, but looks like panicky behaviour.” 

“You know I don’t handle these cases well, Sebastian,” Sheena replied. “Isn’t that why we have the 420-Units to help these new, fellow Shibes?”

With all of the rope pulled back up, Paul closed the hatch and the belly of the plane went quiet. Looking at Sheena, he noted how she bit her lip. He offered, “I’ve done some 420-training. I can help. Just about giving a little reassurance, you know?”

She looked up to Paul, took a breath and then turned back to her wrist watch. “If we have to. But why hasn’t a 420-Unit been called up?”

“You know we have,” Sebastian’s voice replied. “They’re on their way, but, uhm… They get distracted.”

“Sure,” Sheena rolled her eyes. “Probably saw a duck or something.”

“Possibly,” Sebastian concurred. “Would you mind helping the panic-seller? Looks like they’ve sold the dip and bought back two bull-traps. Just until Unit-420 arrives.”

“Ouch,” Paul remarked. Stepping out of line a little he added, “We’ll take the mission, Seb. No problem.”

“Thanks,” Sebastian took Paul’s unauthorized response as confirmation. “I’ve actually hoped you would and already sent co-ordinates to the drop-off plane. You’re heading west a few thousand miles, so put on your oxygen masks if you feel lightheaded. It’ll be early morning over there and, by the looks of the activity on the crypto-exchange app, the panic-seller hasn’t slept well.”

“Sure,” Sheena groaned. “But when Unit-420 arrives I’m heading back to base. Please have the drop-off plane come fetch us soon as possible.”

“Will do. Thanks again,” Sebastian replied, signing off. “Doge equals doge.”

“Doge equals doge,” Sheena and Paul responded. 

As the plane picked up speed, they both pushed the buttons on the wall which released the transparent oxygen masks. Paul had just adjusted his when he asked, “What’s the matter? Are you uncomfortable around panic-sellers?”

“I don’t want to talk about it,” Sheena quietly expressed, turning away and closing her eyes. 

Slicing through the clouds, Paul was scrolling through reddit on his phone as he lolled a few times. Taking screenshots of the Doge-memes. He had tried to show some of the content to Sheena but she wasn’t interested. Her despondency concerned him. Not only because he didn’t want to see her upset, but it would jeopardize the mission if they were unable to console the panic seller. He found a meme uploaded with Elon Musk as the Techno-Viking and showed it to her,

“Look at this. Remember Techo-Viking?” Her eyes blinked. She turned to it and smiled but her eyes still hung at the corners. “Tell me,” he pleaded. “What’s wrong?”

“Don’t want to talk about it,” she answered. “Let’s just get this mission over with.”

The plane appeared to be flying into the sun as it buoyed itself on the horizon. The destination of the suburb was fast approaching and the flight-speed decreased. Pressure stabilized and a light signal indicated that they could take off their masks. Sheena looked to her watch display, tapped the informational mail and said,

“Apparently the investor fell for a bear-trap after buying doge-bear.”

“Really? Wow. Must’ve been traumatic.”

Sheena lifted her face and sighed, then looked back at her display to tap for a coordinate. “Appears as if the panic-seller isn’t at home. Actually…” The plane’s hatch opened up. Both Shibes stood up and looked onto the rushing scene of trees and rooftops below. “Alright, get on my back. I know where the investor is.”

Unit-69 hopped through the hatch, descended to a freefall before opening the parachute. Drifting towards another playpark, Sheena pointed as she turned her face for Paul to hear her. “That’s the investor.” 

Below them, Paul saw someone sitting cross-legged on a park bench wearing jeans and a hoodie. A Rottweiler puppy was running around the swings, chased by a Yorkie. 

They landed near the monkey-bar pyramid as Sheena held on the sidebars. Momentum pivoted them around the iron structure to deflect their falling trajectory. The parachute covered the top of the structure and the Shibes landed on the grass. Correcting their posture, they unhooked themselves and Paul looked to their new, fellow Dogecoin investor. 

“I don’t think he even noticed us.”

Sheena was already gathering the ends of the parachute in order to wrap it up and place it back in her slim backpack. “Why don’t you go talk to him? You said you’ve done your training on this.”

“What should I say?” Paul asked, but noted Sheena shrug as she carried on working on the parachute. Taking a breath, he walked to their target who finally looked up from his mobile. “Hi. How are you?”

The investor uncrossed his legs, looked down and up again from his mobile screen. “Did you just parachute from the sky?”

“Yes we did. Much Wow,” Paul replied. Proud to be part of the impressive stunt with which he had been waiting to impress others. “Flew in with a plane.” He looked up, trying to locate the drop-off plane but it had already disappeared from sight. “It’s gone now, but yes. We’ve been alerted to some panic-selling. Is that you?”

The Yorkshire terrier came running up and barked by Paul’s feet. It was followed by the Rottweiler who playfully mimicked the Yorkie. “You can pet them,” the panicked investor said, getting up from the bench. He placed a hand on the Yorkie’s head. “Okay, Terry. They seem alright.” Kneeling down he patted both dogs. “This is Terry, and this is Suzy.”

From the monkey-bar structure, folding up the fabric, Sheena called out, “I suppose our job is done? Everything okay now?” 

Paul and the investor seemed not to hear her, playing with the dogs as Terry was trying to bite Paul’s hand when he transferred affection to Suzy. Sheena pushed the parachute into the bag and groaned, hoping Paul would overhear her frustration and be encouraged to reconnect with the mission. But he didn’t respond, instead using his finger as a floating target which Terry lunged after to bite in midair. 

The scene upset her. Not the playful dogs or Paul taking his time with the mission, but because it reminded her of a time before she had panic-sold. That horrific experience was still fresh in her memory. 

As she approached, Paul overheard her footsteps and sprang into action. He asked the investor,

“Much hi. What’s your name?”

“Much what? Uhm, Yurri.”

“I’m Paul. This is Sheena.”

Yurri nodded his head though his eyes and cheeks appeared sunken. “Pretty cool you guys just parachuted down here.”

“You don’t seem too impressed,” Sheena remarked as she stood beside Paul, who was still on his haunches beside Terry and Suzy. She knew why though. His turmoil churned inside him so much that he could barely negotiate with the world around him.

“Yeah,” Yurri concurred. He pulled out his mobile to look at the screen again. Gripping his hair, he groaned.

“Just put it away,” Sheena instructed, folding her arms. Seeing Yurri was almost physically painful for her.

“No, wait,” Paul began as he climbed to his feet in order to get closer to Yurri. “We’re from Doge Control. Shibu Unit-69. Did you open a Doge-bear position?”

“I’m so stupid!” Yurri blurted out. Looking up at Paul, “What did you say? Did you say Doge?”

“Yes. What are you currently on?”

Yurri narrowed his eyes on the screen as he whispered, “I’m going to hell for this!”

“Relax,” Paul started, placing a hand on Yurri’s shoulder.

“Just close the position,” Sheena remarked over her shoulder. “No more wow for you.”

“I’m so stupid. I’m losing everything,” Yurri’s expression trembled. “It’s not just my money, you know.”

“You don’t lose anything if you don’t sell,” Paul answered, then leaned over to see the screen. The dogebear had been opened with 10-times leverage. The price went from 27c to 28c, then settled at 27.7776c as Yurri’s hand started shaking. Paul noted that he had a few thousand dollars. “What happened?”

“Please. No details,” Sheena stated. “Just put the phone away.”

“I’m selling!” Yurri exclaimed still attached to the candle sticks. He looked up, “Sell right? I’m going to hell, right?”

“It’s a doge-bear,” Paul shrugged. “Just get rid of it. You’re not a Barry Shilbert, are you?”

“No,” Yurri cried, selecting the sell button. He covered his mouth as he completed the process. He was stable again in the USDT. Just then the Doge price dropped. “NO!”

Suzy started barking and Yurri pulled his legs up to his chest. Terry sprang up and bit onto the seam where it folded by his knee. “It wasn’t just my money,” Yurri said, burying his face in his arms.

“Job done,” Sheena snapped. “Let’s go.”

“We can’t just leave.” Paul leaned back on his hands. “You know, we try and find all those Paperhands. Those guys dumping huge volumes on and off the Dogecoin? They’re experienced. Best thing is to just buy and hodl.”

Yurri put his hands on his face. Then with one hand he grabbed Terry by the collar to pull him off his jeans. “So stupid! How could I be that stupid?!”

“Such volatility. It happens,” Paul countered. “Don’t beat yourself up. It’s risky out there.”

“Such a stupid crypto!” Yurri then shouted. “A stupid joke, meme-coin!”

“Hey!” Sheena shot back. “Hold your mouth. If it’s not for you, it’s not for you. But don’t blame the currency for your stupid panic selling.”

“Ah my gawd!” Yurri groaned. He looked to Paul, “Can’t you reverse this for me? It was just a mistake. I wasn’t that long into it. Not even a week.” Suzy barked then hobbled towards Yurri, sticking her head under his armpit. “No,” he exclaimed, pushing her away. “Can you? I mean, if you’re from the Doge Centre. Or wherever. Please?”

“Can’t do that,” Paul tightened his lips, tilting his head. “Anyway, it’s a decentralized thing. You know?”

“I’m so screwed,” Yurri moaned. 

“Let’s just get out of here,” Sheena stated, turning to leave. Looking back over her shoulder. “We’ve done what we came here to do.”

“Let me just,” Yurri began, scrambling for his phone. He opened the exchange app and looked to Paul. “It’s going up, right?”

“Thought you said Doge was dumb,” Sheena retorted.

Yurri looked to her, mouth hanging open. “You’re right.” He glanced at his phone and muttered, “Ethereum.” Looking to Paul, “Ethereum, right? It’s proven, isn’t it?”

“We’re not financial advisors, bro.”

From the adjacent street they heard someone call out, 

“Such wow, my dudes! Where have you been? Ha-ha.” 

It was Dory, with her mousy-brown hair cut short and wearing her blue hemp onesie. Beside her was Bess, who wore glasses and had beads in her shoulder-length braids. 

Pleased to be relieved from the mission, Sheena dropped her arms as she walked towards the late arriving Unit-420. 

“Much Wow. Where have you been? This guy has opened and closed so many positions he’s probably lost more in fees than in grabbing the wrong end of the trajectory.”

“What’s a trajectory?” Dory asked, making herself lean almost horizontally, comically looking upwards at Bess. She then straightened up as they kept sauntering towards Sheena, Yurri and Paul. Upon meeting Sheena halfway, Dory stuck out for a handshake. “To the moon, dude!”

“You’re much late,” Sheena pursed her lips, shaking Dory’s hand. She then greeted Bess with a nod as Bess put her hands together for a bow. “May we leave you to console this newbie trader? Think he made some promises to some people.”

“Promises,” Bess repeated slowly with closed eyes. “Where Tesla?”

“Exactly,” Sheena concurred. She turned around to Yurri. “Promise anyone a Tesla?”

Yurri groaned as Suzy gave a low growl beside him, then pounced up to put her paws on his shoulder. 

“Oh yes!” Dory exclaimed noting the dogs, and ran up to Yurri. Terry took up a brave posture and yapped as she asked, “Can I?”

Yurri looked up and breathed in. “Sure. He’s friendly.” He stroked the Yorkie’s back to make sure the dog knew he was in good company. While Dory knelt down to ruffle the doge’s ears and Bess took long, moon-strides towards the seated group, Yurri asked, “Are you here to help? I mean, is there any way to reverse this?”

Bess had just taken her last step before lowering herself onto the grass. “Time-travel isn’t possible. Such complicated. Much difficult. Very Wow.” She then proceeded to clap her hands in Suzy’s direction. “Much wow, doggy!”

“This is Terry, that’s Suzy,” Yurri grumbled. Looking at Dory and Paul obsessing over Terry, and Bess squealing while Suzy licked her face, he calmly snapped. “So none of you can help me?”

Dory got on her hands and knees and started crawling around, looking for a stick. “What do you want to time-travel for?” Finding a stick, she then turned around and gesticulated for Terry’s attention. “Looky-look! Catch the stick!”

After Dory threw the stick and Terry scrambled after it, Yurri replied. “I’m stupid. I lost a lot of money.”

“You can’t lose if you…” Bess began, but was interrupted by Yurri.

“Yes. I know. If I don’t sell. But I lost it, okay?”",cryptocurrency
dogecoin,doge story - part V,"She shook her head, uncertain whether this was a dream. “Look,” she whispered again. “My dad’s asleep. I have no idea how berserk he’d get if he saw you guys in my room. You need to go. If you’d like me to not trade as often, or with as much Dogecoin volume, then fine. But please, just leave.”

“I don’t know,” Henry calmly replied. “This is your father’s abode, so it wouldn’t be right if we don’t introduce ourselves. Perhaps show him your little investment activities, hmm?”

Sebastian detected how her face sank at the suggestion, and surmised her position based on her ethnic skin tone and how the religion(s) in the Middle East typically frown on gambling – which the crypto market is largely known for. “Maybe you should heed you father’s concerns.”

Covering her face as she doubled over in her chair, Mia groaned before looking up at the Shibu Unit. “What is even going on here?” She looked about her bedroom. “Is this some practical joke? Where are the cameras?”

“No joke, miss,” Sebastian confirmed.

“This can’t be real,” Mia rebutted.

“Yeah, sure,” Henry appropriated airs. “This is all in your imagination. A ‘simulation’, perhaps.”

Mia squinted her eyes at him, only for Sebastian to agree, “He’s right. You can’t claim that this is the real reality. However, if we are in a simulation, we need you to stop messing around with the Dogecoin value. Do you understand?”

“And what if I don’t?” Mia surprised herself in asking. “You going to break into our house again? How did you even find me?”

“Paperhands Assembly,” Henry remarked. “You were there, weren’t you?”

“Although,” Sebastian raised the palms of his hands in a sign of defense. “We thought you were simply tagging along with your parents, or older relatives.” Extending an olive branch, he added, “The activity we linked to your account are, well. I would say that they resemble the trading patterns of very experienced Paperhands.”

“I’d say I’m pretty average,” Mia replied. 

“No,” Henry countered. “You’re definitely dangerous.”

She felt the compliment and was proud to hear it. Smiling. Sebastian was equally happy to see her relieved by the mutual acknowledgment of her talent. However, it was a talent that played against Dogecoin’s marketability. “This is your first warning. Don’t make us have to visit you again.”

“We’ve got zappy-collars now!” Henry leaned forward with the warning. Turning to Sebastian, “Don’t we?”

“We do,” Sebastian confirmed. Wagging a finger at Mia, “This is very serious. We’ll be keeping an eye on you.”

“Dogecoin?” Mia asked, still in disbelief by the encounter. “You say Dogecoin is serious?”

“Future currency of the world,” Henry remarked. 

“Sure,” Mia rolled her eyes.

“So do you understand?” Sebastian asked.

Mia nodded, “Yes. I understand.”

“You can play around trading with whatever crypto you like. But you leave the Doge alone. Buy and hold. And if you sell, make it for a reason that’s Much Wow. Okay?”

“Yes.”

“The correct response,” Henry stepped forward. “Is *Yes, Much Wow*. Or, *Nice*.”

“Fine,” Mia replied. “Much Nice, Very Wow. Whatever. I won’t do it again.”

“Good. Much Wow,” Sebastian sighed and then turned to leave. “Let’s go, Henry.”

As they climbed out the window, Mia heard the mechanical pulley-sounds of grappling lines being shot outwards and saw them swinging away like Batman or Spiderman impersonators. Completing her unfinished reply, she said under her breath. “Won’t do it again without a VPN.”

Mia’s phoned buzzed with Darren’s reply, “*Yeah, I get what you mean. Well I’ll let you know if anything interesting happens.*”

“*You do that,*” Mia replied. She then added, “*Be safe. Try to blend in. Diamondhands are crazy.*”

“*They’re not all bad ha!*”

“*Those one’s are. Promise me. Be careful.*”

“*Sure. Will do. Anyway, it’s in a few days. See you at school. Good night.*”

“*Goodnight dude.*”

For Mia, however, her night wasn’t over yet. Besides Dogecoin trading and trying her best to help out her father with moral support, there was another thing always pressing on Mia’s mind. A girl. Lexi. The girl who she hugged, when they were just friends a couple years ago, and she smelled her perfume. Felt her soft, long, light red hair brush over her cheek. Felt the tenderness of her hands rest on her back, simply because Mia had done her math homework. Not for the first time, as Lexi often did Mia’s English homework and it was a symbiotic gesture. However, that momentary embrace changed everything. Mia had never liked boys, or at least paid them very little attention. That she was lesbian – as if it were always true but never questioned, like the ‘*Need guns? Ask me*’ xenophobic sign which bullies secretly stuck on her back – caught her completely off-guard. It was an embrace that made Mia immediately pounce her lips against Lexi’s. An action that forever ruined their friendship when Lexi pulled away in disgust. Mia wasn’t disgusted, neither insulted when Lexi rebuked her behaviour. She could only smile, looking at the girl with the long, red hair who was soft and kind. Even when she tried to spit the taste of Mia’s mouth on the ground, and the other schoolkids gathered at the scene to point and laugh, did Mia not have a worry in the world. She loved Lexi and that would never change. Even if the love was never returned, which it hadn’t been thus far, Mia was unable to stop feeling what she felt.

The night was still young so Mia dressed herself for it. Her make-up style was unique in how she gave herself the impression of age well beyond a 50-year-old. Applying lines and shade for wrinkles and sunken cheeks, together with blisters and festering abysses. It was the safest bet, she knew, for walking the streets of her neighbourhood without attracting the wrong attention.

Dressed up in a dated blue, pink-lined tracksuit, thick woolen jersey and bobble at, Mia left the apartment and locked the door behind her. If her dad would wake up and (for some reason) wish to see her in then he’d see the note on her keyboard. Which she hoped he wouldn’t. Simply explaining that she was safe and would be home in a few hours. A precaution where she neither wanted to be caught but wanted less for her dad to be overly worried if she simply seemed to disappear. 

Making her way down the blocks, stepping in and out of the coney streetlights, Mia found Lexi’s house. Standing on the sidewalk behind the lit up bus stop, she messaged,

“*Are you awake?*”

She waited a few minutes before the curtain of Lexi’s bedroom shifted and Lexi’s face appeared. A moment later, having spotted Mia (not for the first time), Lexi pulled the curtain open and stood glaring down at her. Mia smiled, pointed down the road and shrugged, and Lexi just shook her head. Mia messaged again,

“*You busy? Want to go out for a bit?*”

Lexi took out her phone, read the message and dramatized an eye-roll. Mia remained patient until Lexi’s impatience made her reply,

“*No.*”

“Just for a little while,” Mia ventured to cup her mouth and call up.

Had it not been for Mia’s tenacity, as well as her earnest respect of Lexi’s boundaries, then Lexi would never have responded. Their friendship was never the same after Mia kissed her, but it seemed to persist despite Lexi’s frequent rebuffs and thanks to Mia’s persistence. If Mia were anything but a girl of the same age, questions would be raised and Mia leveraged this opportune demographic. Lexi opened the window and leaned out,

“No. Just go, already.” Unable to negate her role in the present situation, where she had accepted Mia’s invitation on a few occasions (following two break-ups with her current boyfriend, and when her uncle died of covid), she added, “Not tonight.” 

Mia shrugged. “Okay. Just thought I’d ask. I was going out anyway.”

Lexi then noticed Mia’s face and how she (again) applied make-up to make her look like an old junkie. “Ned’s Head, again? Really?”

Mia winked and blew a kiss before turning to leave. She heard Lexi call after her. “Message before coming here.” To that, Mia swiveled round on her heels to smile, and then promptly swiveled back around to carry on walking. Over her shoulder Lexi called out again, “But don’t bother if you’re going to Ned’s Head. That place is gross!” 

She never expected for Lexi to return her feelings and, honestly, would be surprised if she ever did. However, it didn’t change what she felt. For all she knew, she may never love again or (if what she was told, or read on the internet was true) she’d simply have to wait for love to strike again. Either way she much preferred routine rejection instead of wallowing in lovesick misery. Compared to losing her mother and brothers, she considered this puppy-love rejection to be a far easier burden to carry. *It was admittedly strange*, she often wondered, *the ways people deal with their grief*.

It was true that Mia was going out regardless of whether Lexi wanted to or not. There was a local bar not too far away which she managed to connive her way into. She walked past the laundromat, the takeaway pizza joint, crossed the bridge over the railway tracks and stepped towards ‘Ned’s Head’ bar opposite the local park. Just before going in, she ran a shade of purple lipstick over her teeth. Completing the old junkie disguise. 

With the lockdown restrictions still affecting the number of regular patrons, Mia walked in with her obligatory mask and sat down at the bar. There were only two others a few seats away while a few of the tables in the smoking area were occupied where the karaoke played. She made it easy on Jarrod, the owner and barman, to recognize her as she always wore the same garish tracksuit. It meant that he would recognize her quickly. Soon as she appeared in the corner of his eye, while handling the contactless POS for one of the two gentlemen at the bar, he promptly prepared the drink she always ordered. A single-shot whiskey and orange juice. One of the men looked at her askance to which she responded by baring her teeth (as she imagined an antisocial, degenerate would). Jarrod placed the drink in front of her,

“Here you go, Tia.” His attitude was cold, as usual. 

“Thanks bud,” Mia replied, making her voice as gruff as possible to imitate decades of smoking. She slapped money on the counter and turned to make her way towards her usual corner of the bar.

She presented her stained teeth to the man at the bar as she passed by, overhearing him turn to Jarrod to ask. “How old is she?”

“Old enough. Trust me,” Mia heard the barman reply. Acquainting another customer to his intermittent problem. “Just a junkie, but she keeps to herself. Let me know if she gives you any problems.” To emphasize both his cover-up story and his disdain for it, he said aloud. “She’s on a final warning.”

Nestled in the corner, listening to two drunk women singing karaoke to an 80’s ballad, Mia felt herself disappear. Fading away from the problems. She only went to Ned’s Head when Dogecoin’s volatility (and pump-n-dumping volumes of coin) didn’t let her soar from the peaks after riding up the troughs. Catching an upswing following and selling just before the Japanese candle fell into a green falling star. Those high feelings of getting it right and avoiding sailing in the open, clear air of the USDT. Soaring. Unfortunately, it wasn’t to be that evening as the gains from the SNL pump-and-dump presented some trepidation in the Dogecoin market – going on for nearly three weeks. As a backup plan, with Lexi unavailable as usual, Ned’s Head was a place where she could melt away.

Obtaining this unwelcomed entry into an establishment that would be heavily fined (if not closed down) should anyone ever suspect her real age, was a stroke of luck in a way. Adept at hacking, she uncovered some unusual expenses at Ned’s while surveying the transactions of various establishments. Assuming a little bit of tax evasion, she threatened Jarrod with screenshots and highlights, and she followed it up with a recording of herself being served at the bar. He wouldn’t know that she’d never report him, but neither would she give him too many problems. As long as he played it cool, allowed her to find a corner on a quiet night, then this opaque understanding would continue for another year. 

Drowning herself in the white noise, scrolling through r/nature and sipping her poisoned orange; Mia was able to relax. Knowing that an alarm would wake her up in a couple of hours in case she drifted too far away. However, when a figure took a seat on the opposite end of the table, she looked up to hear him say,

“Still coming to Ned’s, I see. Surprised Jarrod hasn’t a nervous breakdown with you putting his establishment at so much risk.” It was Sebastian. Not in the Shibu Unit-69 dark attire, but in his shorts and bomber jacket. She was always distracted by his thin legs, always exposed despite the weather and time of day. He was smiling, but became serious as he looked to her. “You didn’t reply to my last email. Have you given it any thought?”

Mia wasn’t in the mood for another confrontation, regardless of the truce Sebastian routinely extended. The email he referred to was another invitation for her to join their Shibu Unit-024. A division within Doge-Base where day-traders (some of whom recruited from the Dogecoin Paperhands) plied their skills in harvesting gains in other cryptocurrencies. He had informed her of it a few months ago believing she’d jump on the opportunity. He then followed up her negation with an offer to employ her, paying out a guaranteed amount every month which would placate her father’s misgivings on the industry. When she negated that offer, his latest email was coupled with the sentiment that the crypto market couldn’t be that much fun. Not after the Paperhands syphoned their gains and left the market hodling for dear life. She considered the email to contain some emotional triggers and thus didn’t dignify it with an answer. Now, with him (not for the first time) making an in-person appearance, she replied,

“Still not interested. And I told you why.”

Sebastian twisted his mouth and drummed his fingers on the tabletop. “You know we don’t encourage people to invest more than they can afford. Especially not young people.”

Mia shook her head as she turned her attention to r/natureisfuckinglit. Under her breath she responded, “You don’t discourage it either.”

“Dogecoin,” Sebastian started (making Mia sigh as she prepared for the sales pitch). “… Is a way for people to get control over their financial wellbeing. Certainly, in the beginning, like now, it’s a precarious time if people are thinking short-term. But we’re aiming to alleviate this as soon as possible. One of the ways is to dissuade Paperhandling of the coin…”

Mia interrupted by speaking under her breath again. “Attacking them.”

“Well,” Sebastian couldn’t ignore the accusation. “Not violently.”

“I heard about those shocking collars. Thought it was a joke at first.”

“There’s a lot more pain felt by investors being collectively shorted by Paperhands.” He then leaned closer to add, “I didn’t come here to argue with you.”

“I’m not joining your Doge-Base,” Mia repeated. She lifted her feet onto her chair, shielding herself with her legs as she kept scrolling through nature posts. “And you’re spoiling my pleasant evening.”

“Are you aware of the Bot-Chad which the Paperhands have designed?”

Had the subject not been mildly amusing, Mia may have ignored him. “Lol. Yes. I like it. Gives a little life to the market.”

“We’ll agree to disagree,” Sebastian countered. 

“Diamond-Chad,” Mia guffawed. “Your Diamondhand counterpart. That thing is probably the dumbest algorithm I’ve ever come across.” Unable to stop herself from smirking in Sebastian’s direction, she mimicked Diamond-Chad’s recycled outputs (regardless of the input). “Urgh, not selling. Derp, still hodling. Grr, diamond hands.” She shook her head, returning to her pone. “Lol. Such riot.”

“Diamond-Chad is awesome,” Sebastian calmly replied. “It’s the best algorithm we have to negate any hacking input to alter the trusted output. I can’t say the same about Bot-Chad.”

“What are you talking about,” Mia asked, barely attentive. 

“It’s what I came to inform you. We have good reason to believe that Bot-Chad and many other smaller trading algorithms, have been hacked.”

Hearing this irritated Mia as she was enjoying the uploaded video of seal at the peak chill. “Again,” she started, turning to Sebastian. “What are you talking about? Is this another leap of imagination excusing why Dogecoin isn’t worth a dollar?”

Sensing that his argument was at a fork in the road and he needed to capitalize on the attention he manage to get from Mia, Sebastian turned to face her and rudely helped himself to her orange-whiskey. 

“Hey!” Mia pulled back, disgusted.

When he downed the half-finished contents, he put the empty glass back in front of her. “That’s how quickly, and deceivingly this Artificial Intelligence will pounce on every investor in the market. Whether you’re a Paperhand or a Diamondhand. Soon as you put in a buy position, you better be happy to pay more for the exchange-rate fees than what you’ll make out of the trade. Same with a sell position.”

“That’s stupid,” Mia responded. Still angry about him stealing her drink. “I don’t follow the herd. Trading algorithms cull the herd. You, more than anyone, should know that I’m better than most traders.”

“Sure,” Sebastian shrugged. “Which is why we wanted you to join Shibu Unit-024. That said, you’re not better than this AI-trader. No one is.”

“You’re lying,” Mia accused him. “You’re spinning a fake story trying to get me join your dumb group of traders. You’re inventing a strawman.”

Sebastian turned away to lean back against the wall. “Funny. That’s exactly what we’ve named it. ASI – Artificial Strawman Intelligence. It doesn’t exist because no one wrote the code. The code wrote itself.”

“And how would you know such a thing, huh?” Mia asked, forcing herself to at least be amused by the rude disruption of her evening.

“You know our hacking department exceeds your skills, don’t you?” Sebastian provided a condescending context. “You’re aware that we know of all the 69 wallets and accounts you trade from. Just to have us believe that you’re trading in small volumes, when in fact you’re trading with 69 of these small volumes. That you’ve written some meagre code titled ‘Ball-Breaker’, which automatically manages these individual accounts. Am I right?” 

The remark made Mia hide her smile. She, in fact, had 420 wallets and accounts and purposefully allowed Doge-Base to believe that they’ve flanked her operation. An operation that they daren’t attack, by breaking into bedroom window, again, because Sebastian is desperate for her to join them. He’d been open to her about keeping her secret a secret from Shibu Unit-69, and she correctly figured that he’d continue to do so. That he was more worried about how she would react in the market if that sliver of trust was compromised. That he believed her when she bluffed about scamming Dogecoin investors who shouldn’t be investing in crypto to begin with. 

“So?”

“Well,” Sebastian sighed. “Then you can trust me that when we tracked down all these trading algorithms, tracing their origins and compiled their combined operating mechanisms…” He went quiet. Slowly turning to her, he whispered. “The tail is wagging the dog, Mia.”

“What?”

“The tail,” Sebastian continued to whisper. “Has another tail. And that tail is wagging the tail that wags the dog.”

“You’re not making sense,” Mia shook her head again. She put herself back on the seat with her knees to her chest, refreshing the video of the seal lying back in the peak of chill.

“Listen to me, Mia. Their combined output correlates with actions that accurately predict the outcome of two successive purple flags.”

The statement annoyed Mia. The implication of what he said was too ridiculous. It was only natural that a blue flag with its rising support would break through the resistance, and that a red flag with falling resistance would break downwards through the support. But to know the outcome of a purple flag, with rising support and falling resistance, could never be predicted. It’s occurrence in the market was akin to Schrodinger’s Cat. So for Sebastian to speculate on accuracy following two of these purple flags was simply wrong. 

“No,” Mia commented. “I believe you in that you believe yourself, and that your entire wingbat department believes that. I don’t believe that it exists, though. You probably just stumbled across a couple of lucky guesses, and now you’re wrapped up in a strawman conspiracy.” Turning to him, she concluded. “If you had anything better to do than simply hodling your Dogecoin, you wouldn’t be in need of these conspiracies.”

“No conspiracy,” Sebastian raised his eyebrows. “This thing is out there.” For a last attempt to convince her, he asked, “When was the last time you made a reasonable profit?”

“Market is sideways,” Mia rebutted the lure. 

“So? Don’t tell me you can’t make a little bit of profit in a sideways market.”

That suggestive comment stung her. She closed her phone and put it in her pocket before turning back to him. In a whisper – though not for the same reason, merely to not draw too much attention to herself – Mia replied, “Don’t try and turn your problems into my problems. I have plenty. I don’t need more.”

Sebastian pulled back, satisfied that he managed to plant the seed and that she’d try to prove herself. Despite the evidence at Doge-Base being speculative, there was no accounting for these anomalies. They were unique, and based on the merged behaviours of various trading algorithms. There was no other explanation for such a market predictor other than some form of algorithm that drew upon the programmed intelligence from multiple sources. He was even pleased to see her get angry by his question, because he was probably correct. She had been losing in her trades. Or at least suffered a net loss ever since Dogecoin fell below 40c.

“Our problem, Paperjet.” He replied, addressing her by the nickname he had given her in his first email, asking whether she’d join Shibu Unit-024. “Diamondhands and Paperhands are at the mercy of ASI. And it’s learning. Don’t forget that.” 

Mia just looked at him. She didn’t like the name ‘Paperjet’. She didn’t like it because it revealed a little too much about her. 

“Think about it,” Sebastian concluded. He got up from his chair and turned to walk away, but stopped and turned back. From an inside pocket of his bomber jacket he pulled out an orange juice-box and put it on the table. Her eyes peeled back in shock at how he jeopardized the guise of her age. “Don’t drink it all at once. It’s got preservatives.”

Mia grabbed the juice-box and stuffed it into the inside pocket of her tracksuit before anyone would see, and watched the Diamondhand leave the bar. 

Walking home from school, Mia and Darren find themselves in a bit of sunshine with the wind dying down. While enjoying this clearer weather, Darren asks,

“Are you sure you don’t want to come to the Paperhand Assembly tomorrow?”

“Very sure,” Mia replied, enjoying the cool breeze which stop stinging her face. Although she considered telling Darren about her run-in with a top-tier Diamondhand the previous evening, she decided against it. The questions surrounding her being perpetually pestered to join their Shibu Unit-042 were already enough. Darren’s input (as he always had an opinion) would further complicate something which was already unnecessarily complicated. Going against her belief that Dogecoin shouldn’t be endorsed as a hodling asset, she was inclined to believe that the prospect of a reliable income would benefit her and her dad. 

“You really think that Diamondhands are getting more dangerous?” Darren asked.

To redirect the conversation, Mia asked, “Have you heard anything about an AI-trader?”

“A what?”

“Something like an artificial intelligence, doing trades in the crypto market. Something along the lines of an ASI? Artificial Strawman Intelligence?”

“Oh, right! Ha-ha,” Darren chuckled. “Yes. There were a couple of people banned from the Paperhand Discord about that. A few talking about an AI that learns from all the bot-traders, and is turning into a super-trader. They made it seem like paper-trading is going to suffer. They were kicked out because they were obviously Diamondhand impersonators.”

“So it’s just a bit of FUD, right?” Mia asked hesitantly.

“I don’t think it’s real. Even if it was, Bot-Chad would know about it.”

“I guess so.”

“You should come through tomorrow. We can ask about it at the assembly.”

Mia sighed and shook her head. She then smiled, “Can’t.” Turning to Darren with bouncy eyebrows and a happy secret to share, she added, “I’ve got a date.”

“Oh,” Darren deflated. “Uhm, with Lexi, again. I’m guessing.”

“Yeup! Another problem with Ronny. We’re getting tea so she can talk about it. Pollytea.”

“I don’t know why you keep doing that. She’s not gay.”

“I know.”

“Then, why? You’re just going to carry on being a friendzoned shoulder to cry on when she has boy problems?”

“Sure. I love her.”

Darren shook his head. Frustrated by Mia’s unrelenting infatuation. “Why don’t you just move on? I don’t know how you manage it.” Ironically, his feelings for and situation with Mia was very similar to those between Mia and Lexi. His, however, were kept secret.

“Why do you say that? As if people are happier to be try and reproduce a love with someone else, even though it’ll never feel as powerful? I think I’m better off just taking what I can get.”

“It doesn’t frustrate you that she’s with Ronny? And whenever they fight, she talks it over with you and then gets back with him?”

“I should thank him, ha!” Mia punched Darren’s shoulder. “When he does good, she’s happy and I’m happy. When he messes up, she gets upset and spends time with me. And I’m happy. Like I said, I’ll take what I can get as long as it’s from who I really want.”

“Sure,” he sighed. “You, uh. You want to trade some Dogecoin at my place or yours tonight?”

“Oh, my buddy!” Mia threw an arm around his neck. “Next time. I need to spend time with my dad tonight. He’s been working super hard lately.”

“Oh, okay,” Darren tried not to sound upset. “The Fulfillment center getting busier?”

Mia had already been to the shops to pick up ingredients for the Mahshi. Plenty of fresh vegetables, rice, ground beef, tomatoes and cumin sauce were all laid out on the kitchen countertops. Nasir, having come home and showered, was preparing the sauce while Mia prepared the vegetables. Elvis Presley’s *Wooden Heart* was playing as part of their personalized compilation on the stereo. It provided her with a nice break from reality. It was another way (besides successful paper-trading and undercover orange whiskeys) in which Mia could feel airborne. For Nasir, he still needed time to get work-related stress off his chest, for which Mia was happy to be a soundboard.

“I can’t tell if I’m happy with these robots or not.”

“Uh-huh?” She was happy whenever her dad could vent his frustration.

Nasir turned to face his daughter from the simmering saucepan he kept stirring. “You know those videos I showed you? The robots moving around?”

“Yeah,” Mia nodded. “Automated Guided Robots.”

“Yes, yes,” Nasir turned back to the sauce. Satisfied that she was listening and not just making listening noises. “So, they make less errors. Sure. But the job is still stressful. Whether it takes 10 minutes or 5 minutes to do something, it’s still stressful.”

“Yeah.”

“So the robots take 5 minutes, which is nice. But that just means twice as much needs to be done. And even when it is done, must I celebrate with a robot?”

“Isn’t a team effort?” Mia asked. “You’ve still got you human colleagues, right?”

“It’s sad, Mia,” Nasir shook his head, smelling the cumin to relax. “Two gone last month, and now just three of us left. Even quality checking, making sure the incoming boxes are coordinated with outgoing physical addresses, no funny business or anything… apparently it can be automated, too.”

Mia furrowed her brow and turned to her dad. “They can replace you with a robot? Completely automate the quality control?”

“It seems so. It seems like Amazon has compiled so much data that they can basically create a plethora of artificial customers. Apparently, there isn’t a real customer alive which can’t be matched up with an artificial equivalent. Real customers aren’t even aware that they’re matched up with one or two AI-replicas, who look at every order the customer places and decides whether it is what they ordered.”

Her eyes grew. The thought of AI at Amazon, the artificial trading-bot intelligence, and the rumours going around. “That’s crazy,” she managed to reply.

“Sure,” Nasir shrugged. “I’m not too worried about my job. They are too early in the process. My colleagues who left did so when they found out about it. Not because they were fired.”

The stereo started playing *Big River* by Jimmy Nail and Mark Knopfler. It allowed Mia and her father to let the topic rest for a while as it was their joint favourite song.

With her father back to bed for another early rise, Mia went straight to her PC and opened the crypto exchange website. Regardless of whether it was true or not about an AI-trader being out there, especially targeting Dogecoin; she still felt like the possibility was real enough. She’d therefore need to be on higher alert should anything feel out of place.

Looking at the Doge/USDT chart, she gauged the behaviour of the previous two days. It was the end of the week, so she expected a bit of a dip which comes from Dogecoin miners selling what they earned. They’d do that no more regularly since the news about transaction fees for Doge being lowered, and she expected that miners would subsequently be earning less. 

As usual, the sideways movement was hitting highs and lows ranging only a few cents, and she waited. From her USDT collection, she was eager to start off with an amount which was a little more than usual. Something she tended to do whenever she felt her alertness being extra peaky.

A dip came as a red 5min candle dropped and showed very little wick or string. It was the third one, and she waited for two more, getting ready to buy at the moment a red or green crucifix appeared. 

Another red candle came and left, showing a downwards mace, while she scrolled left and right to determine the support line. Buy-positions were adding up as another red candle emerged, sinking and forming another mace. It then sunk quickly, reaching the preexisting buy-positions, but then shot upwards. It turned into a crucifix. Turned green, back to red, then green again. She executed the purchase and then leaned back in her chair. Becoming agitated, feeling unnecessarily concerned, she reminded herself not to get greedy and allocated 80% of the position for a sell-position for a mere 2c rise. 

The crucifix candle turned red, produced another candle which turned green, and then unexpectedly plummeted to create a solid red bar with a tiny string at the bottom. Forcing herself, Mia shrugged and told herself, *Just wait*. Not to react too quickly to unexpected movements. *Just a casino*, she whispered. 

She then noticed that the buy positions were dropping in value. *That’s weird*, so she had a quick look at anything Doge-related on Twitter. There seemed to be nothing new for two days. *Okay, probably just some miners waking up to the news of lower-value mining rewards*. The red candle was almost entirely solid as a new candle emerged. The new candle was green, but turned red immediately. 

Scrolling back in time to re-determine the apparent support line, it seemed as if the line was slanted. Perhaps not with respect to the week, but the previous week was a little higher so it made a bit of sense. For safety, she waited while watching the candle drop lower. It then lifted up, leaving a string behind, and she noticed the buy-orders rising in value. *Time to DCA*, and she converted some more USDT to Dogecoin. 

Two hours later she was in bed. Frustrated as she somehow turned 10% of her entire stockpile into Doge from DCA’ing and not being willing to take the hit. She cursed herself for the buy positions at the end of the week. She should’ve known better. It was just enough that all her coins had sell-positions, where a quick calculation meant that a little bit of profit should appear by tomorrow afternoon. Sunday, latest.

Support was broken when Mia came into her after a shower, revealing a line graph that appeared promising when she woke up. So promising that she added to her position. She was unaware that she was holding her breath while getting dressed. Getting ready to see Lexi at the Pollytea coffee shop. Meant to be a nice, easygoing late morning, with some one-on-one time with the cutest girl ever, turned out entirely opposite. A fifth of her holding was a sinking Dogecoin. It was ruining her concentration, sat by the mirror where she arranged her bangs. Those Dogecoins affected her immensely, and she thought, *Argh! Whatever. It was one bad night and a silly revenge position. Kill it.* Storming to her computer she looked at the line graph, picking up and dropping off, well below the support and a thinning number listed buy-orders. Normally she would’ve left it, and just wait until she came into profit. This time, unhappy by how she interpreted the graph, those open positions were going to haunt her. The line flicked upwards quickly, rose half a cent and her eyes grew wide. Her mouse hovered above the sell button, ready to terminate the loss, and she waited as her loss was minimizing. It picked up a little bit more, started levelling, and she looked to the sell button to make sure all the Dogecoins were accounted for. They were, and just as she selected the purpose to sell the line dropped back down. All she had down was lower all the previous sell-positions. She missed it. Her eyes narrowed and she deleted the new position, selected her Dogecoins again, and then sold them all at market value. It dropped lower before all coins completed the transaction. Looking at the time, 10:52, she had to leave. She wouldn’t necessarily be late, but she needed to leave. She sold the remaining coins at an even lower price. She was beaten. She straightened up, looking down on the exchange and took a deep breath. *Guess I overestimated you Diamondhands*.

The sun had certainly taken center stage of a blue sky, beating down on the top of the umbrella under which Lexi and Mia sat. Lexi wore her short jeans and Mia wondered if it was for her, until Lexi extended them to tan. 

“Chai, please,” Mia replied to the waitress, who smiled and nodded her pony-tailed head. 

“Thanks, hon,” Lexi sighed, not looking up from her legs as the waiter turned to get their order. “So…” 

They had barely greeted before Lexi motioned Mia into the coffee shop. It was a quaint building on the corner of the street, and besides the few tables for meals and drinks inside it also had a couple couches and a 2nd-hand bookshelf. Further along, a garden area contained more tables with umbrellas as well as a hedge which blocked most of the noise from the traffic. Lexi had gained the attention of the waitress and led both her and Mia outside, ordering a green tea along the way.

“You’re feeling okay?” Mia extended a hand halfway across the table, ready for touch when needed.

Lexi exhaled with incense. “He’s been messaging my sister.” Rolling her eyes to add, “Again.”

“Oh, that’s horrible,” Mia replied. It wasn’t the first time Lexi remarked on Ron’s flirtatious behaviour towards her older, college sister.

“She told me that he’s messaging her almost every day. That’s more than I get, Mia!”

“He’s sly, Lexi,” Mia responded, taking back her hand and using it to rest her chin instead.

“He is,” Lexi concurred, though not in a way that would reflect a negative attribute. As if thinking about it, she defined it as, “It’s like he’s sneaky. Mischievous. Plans, and… thinks things through. You know?”

“What?” Mia asked. “No, I don’t.”

“Argh!” Lexi grabbed her face to inexplicably groan.

Their green and chai teapots arrived with the waitress gently placing them down, along with two cups. 

“Thank you,” Mia said.

“Dear,” Lexi turned to the waitress, as if exhibiting the reddened grief of her face. “Thank you. Can you bring an ashtray, too?”

“Sure.”

“Smoking?” Mia asked.

Lexi picked up her handbag and stuck her hand in. Removing two rolled tobacco cigarettes, “I took these from Ron’s pre-roll tin.” She shrugged. “I’m going to smoke them.”

“It’s not weed?”

“No. I don’t think so.” Lexi presented the underside filter. “He uses these for tobacco.”

Mia lifted an eyebrow and took it from Lexi’s hand. She smelled it and gave it back, “Can’t smell anything. Smells like regular cigarette.”

The waitress returned and placed an ashtray on the table, exchanging a quick recognition and then left. Lexi lit the cigarette as Mia poured her chai, smelling the aroma while Lexi tried to appear casual. Taking small drags and holding the cigarette away at a distance. When Mia blew on the surface of his tea, Lexi coughed a little and said,

“Can’t believe he’d do it again.”

“What did he message your sister?”

Lexi blew out some smoke and offered the cigarette, “Do you want some?”",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Any advice for a low-risk short-term investment?,"Greetings,  


I've only recently started reading/learning more about investing so any advice will be much appreciated.  


So currently, I am 21 with around 20k EUR savings. Right now the money is in a saving account in my bank, but the interest rate is **close** **to 0.**   
I want to put my savings somewhere and contribute around 600-700 EUR every month. Ideally, this would be something that is considered **relatively** **low-risk** and would yield around **3%** on a yearly basis.   
After around 3 to 4 years I want to be able to cash out the money and buy myself a home.   


I have an emergency fund and I also plan on contributing around 200-300 EUR in a mutual fund/ETF.  


I know the mutual funds/ETFs are quite risky that's why they have higher yields, but as for the savings, I need something which is less risky and something that I can cash out at any moment (for example if I invest in a mutual fund and the MF doesn't perform that well, I might have to wait a couple more years to 'recover' from the negative returns from the previous years, which I really don't want to do).  


  
I live in a country that is a part of European Union, so I am not sure if I will be able to use a US based fund/solution.

personalfinance,"US Citizen living abroad, haven't been filing taxes. Now considering remote work in US - is it possible?","As the title says I'm a US citizen, currently living in Canada as a permanent resident, working for a company in Canada. I'm aware that I've made some irresponsible choices and am looking for advice, not judgement. I don't plan to return to the US to live, so have neglected my financial situation back home. Recently I've started considering looking for remote jobs in the US, as I keep hearing about expanding remote opportunities and increasing salaries in the wake of the pandemic. However, I imagine I'll have to address the financial situation I've left behind me if I want to do that, and the first step is figuring out what that looks like. Here is some info I think is relevant (minor details obscured for privacy); feel free to ask if I've left something important out:

1. I moved out of the US about 10 years ago. While living in the US, I worked for about 5 years in low-wage jobs and never earned enough to owe taxes; however, I did file taxes and collect tax refunds every year that I worked in the US, except for the year I left. (I did contact my last employer in the US and ask them to email me my W2 so I could file, but didn't hear back.) I've only lived in one state; this state does not have a personal income tax, so I have only ever filed a federal tax return.
2. After leaving the US I moved to China and worked there for about 5 years. During this time I did not file taxes in the US or report my income, because my income was well under the Foreign-Earned Income exclusion clause and as far as I knew I had no tax liability. (I know this is unadvisable and I was supposed to be filing even if I didn't owe; I just didn't much care at that point in my life.) I did pay Chinese taxes.
3. I moved from China to Canada and have worked here for about 2 years. I have not filed taxes in the US, but have filed provincial/federal taxes in Ontario/Canada using my Canadian SIN number. Currently I make about $50k CAD per year.

If hired remotely to do a US job, I assume I would have to catch up on filing my past taxes - is this correct? If so, how would I go about that given the fact that I don't have reliable documentation of my earnings for most of the past decade? What about my tax situation going forward - if I took a remote US job (looking in salary range of $50-75k USD), where could I have tax liability? As I understand it's generally possible to avoid being ""double taxed"" federally at my income level, but what about state/provincial taxes?

Any helpful advice is appreciated. Thank you very much!",finance
personalfinance,I feel like I’m falling behind and I don’t know what to do,"I recently moved to another province in May and incurred moving expenses and then found out my credit card expenses will be going up this month (they have separate credit card rules, it’s 5% of the balance each month).

On the credit card I have a balance of $6600 which means $330 a month for the minimum payment.

Then I have another credit card with $11,100 balance but it has a lower interest rate (however they also don’t know I moved so I’m afraid it might come under the 5% rule in the new year). I pay about $110 a month into it.

I then have $28k in student debt left which I pay $480 a month. This I can reduce to $260 temporarily to adjust but I feel like I’m so close (5 years left to pay it off).

I also have a line of credit with my parents that’s almost paid off with 3k that we each put $50 in a month (total $100).

I’m 28 and I know I’m more fortunate than others since I have a government job (4K a month after taxes but that will decrease next year with the new province when I do my taxes). I’m the only one in my family with a graduate degree and I feel I’ve done everything right (outside of the debt, but there were circumstances where I didn’t have a choice). And I increasingly feel like I’m falling behind relative to my peers. 

My parents don’t really have money so can’t help, it’s looking increasingly difficult to build savings for a house or any at all and I feel like giving up at times.

I’m not sure if I should secure a second job or change the terms of my student payment temporarily to tackle my credit card. I just want to try and save but some of these debts were incurred due to my student years and limited financial support.

After all expenses are incurred I’m left with about $230 a week for any disposable income (that would also be for groceries). Has anyone been in such a shit situation and had success or should I give up on home ownership?

EDIT: I also have $6k in investments at the moment as well but I would prefer not to sell them.

personalfinance,Establishing Investment Account for Niece's Future,"Hello /r/personalfinance, my niece just turned 1 and I want to setup an investment account for her. I'm mostly hoping it'll one day be used for college but I want to be flexible. I plan on continuing to contribute to the account over the years and hope that maybe other family members will as well. I'm mostly unsure about how I should setup the account and whose name it should be in to be the most tax advantaged and also the most advantaged for college federal aid purposes. Here's some information to help you help me.

* I trust my sister 100% and find it unlikely that we will become estranged over the years so putting the account in her name seems like an option.
* My wife and I are high earners, my sister and her husband are solidly middle class. Not sure if this matters for tax purposes. 
* I want the funds to be available for my niece as she grows up if they need them. Something like an expensive sports travel team or dance team or an unplanned hardship. Again, I trust my sister's judgement and don't think she'd use the money for something frivolous. 

This being said, what's the best way to do this? A 529 account seems pretty rigid but has tax benefits. What about a normal, non tax advantaged account? And should the account be in my nieces name with my sister as the custodian, in my sister's name or in my name? And how does this affect college federal aid for her presuming the federal aid laws and stipulations don't change over 17 years?

personalfinance,Need advice on a contract regarding potential tax bomb,"There is a student loan repayment award in exchange for 6 years of service at a specific place of employment being offered in my state.

Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) tax (Social Security and Medicare) from a participant’s award. Taxes are paid directly to the IRS on the participant’s behalf. All STAR LRP payments and federal taxes withheld are reported to the participant and the IRS on a Form W-2 after the end of the tax year. Loan repayments may also be subject to state and local income taxes.

Participants who want additional funds withheld to cover the income tax on their awards should indicate the additional amount to be deducted on a Form W-4.

CryptoCurrency,Number of boating accidents vs price of Monero.,"So I thought it would be interesting to see if there's a strong correlation between XMR price and ~~cold storage withdrawals~~ recreational boating accidents. Using Federal Recreational-Boating-Statistics report for 2020, we can gather that boating accidents are on a significant bull run starting in 2020, emerging from a double bottom reversal.

https://preview.redd.it/79g2oa24dsc71.png?width=521&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4d9c24972b7ab9693746fc94f9e46794a525ad78

The note is interesting, suggesting that boating accidents only get reported if you happen to lose at least $500 worth of your dearest crypto and have increased roughly by 20% in 2020. It is also very interesting to see that deaths from accidents didn't increase as much despite massive increase in accidents in general. It's almost like people have ""safe"" accidents on purpose, whatever that purpose may be (not defined on the charts alone).

While Monero gained around 200% in 2020, so far the correlation seems to be in tact (around 1:10), thought we will have to wait for the 2021 boating accidents report to further study if we're bullish on the boating industry making money on having to sell new boats or not.

CryptoCurrency,A beginner's guide to Polkadot (DOT) - Educational,"If you’ve been on any major cryptocurrency exchange, you may have noticed there’s a LOT of coins. There’s thousands of them, and they’re all different. Some of them are faster, some are more private, some are more versatile, or energy efficient, etc. Some are exactly the same with different names. Regardless, each of them has a role to play in the future of crypto. Every time a new coin pops up it tries to occupy a new niche corner of the market, used for a different reason. Because of this, a popular phrase has arisen: *the future is multi-chain*.

In 1950, the Diner’s Club International program was created. It was the first credit card of its time. Now, over 70 years later there are hundreds of cards. Each one has a different set of interest rates, rewards, terms and conditions, etc. They each all vie for market-share, but for most people, owning a credit card is not a zero-sum game. You can have more than one, and which one you use for any purchase depends on context and circumstance. When making a business purchase, use the business card. Buying gas? use the card that gives cash back.

In the future cryptocurrency will operate the same way. First there was Bitcoin, and it was what most people used for several years, without competition. Now, there are hundreds of different coins, and advanced wallet software gives you the power to use dozens of them from one application. However, while there are lots of different coins to choose from, it can be a pain to keep track of what you own, convert between them, and transfer funds over networks.

dogecoin,Why I think Gemini Earn will be a scam and will hurt many people.,"A few points to make as a premise:

1. Gemini has partnered with a crypto lender called Genesis to earn their users interest on customer Earn deposits. [https://www.coindesk.com/gemini-crypto-lender-genesis-yield-on-customer-deposits](https://www.coindesk.com/gemini-crypto-lender-genesis-yield-on-customer-deposits)
2. Genesis is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group. 
3. Digital Currency Group's founder and CEO is the one and only Barry Silbert.

So the question you need to ask yourself is: Given Barry's obvious inclination that DOGE will be going down, why would his company be borrowing DOGE at an interest rate through Gemini? 

The obvious answer is that they are using the borrowed DOGE to short the market trying to drive down the price. 

This can go one of two ways. 

1. They short DOGE successfully and the price goes down
2. They fail and DOGE takes off to the moon. 

In scenario 1 the implications are simple, the price goes down and the Earn users have more coins but with less value.

***Here is where it gets interesting.*** 

In scenario 2 Genesis Lending will be out **BIG** money, not only would they need to pay back the DOGE they borrowed at a higher price but also the 7.4% interest accrued. From a retail investor point of view this sounds great right? Well, in the terms and conditions of Gemini Earn ([https://www.gemini.com/legal/gemini-earn-program-terms-and-authorization-agreement#section-1-program-risks](https://www.gemini.com/legal/gemini-earn-program-terms-and-authorization-agreement#section-1-program-risks)) in line item 1. it says your assets are at risk, they are not insured and the risks can include up to total loss of your digital assets. So what happens if Genesis Lending is out huge money if they lose the shorting game and cant afford to cover their losses. What happens if they have to file bankruptcy. IF that happened, any DOGE that was deposited in Gemini Earn you would not be able to get back. The terms and conditions would specifically protect Gemini in this circumstance since Earn users have to agree to the risk of losing all their assets when they sign up for the Earn program.

I'm not saying this is guaranteed to happen and I'm not trying to create unnecessary FUD, but this scenario playing out is possible and could be detrimental to many. It's my opinion that you should just keep all your coins on a hardware wallet, that's the only real way to guarantee they are protected.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: IF the DOGE community is successful and goes to the moon, its possible the lenders partnered with Gemini Earn will not be able to cover their losses and you could lose all your coins that are deposited in Gemini Earn. To keep your coins safe, just put it in a hardware wallet.

&amp;#x200B;

**Greyscale-**

""Is the world’s **largest digital currency asset manager**. It sponsors fourteen investment products, including the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust and the Digital Large Cap Fund""... Basically crypto ETFs.

Here's the ""products"" they offer

1. Greyscale Basic Attention Token Trust

&amp;#x200B;

**CoinDesk-**

""CoinDesk is the leading source of **blockchain news, research, and data**. It organizes Consensus, the digital asset industry’s premier annual event."" Simple put, a news to push DCG/ Greyscales narratives. They literally work in [the same fucking building](https://www.coindesk.com/coindesk-to-move-into-same-building-as-owner-digital-currency-group) as DCG.

&amp;#x200B;

**Foundry-**

Is a **financing and advisory** company focused on digital asset **mining** and **staking**. By tapping DCG’s institutional expertise, capital, and market intelligence, Foundry provides North American b\*\*\*\*\*\* miners and manufacturers with the resources needed to maintain and secure decentralized networks. They also run the ""Foundry USA Pool"" to guarantee **stable payouts** for miners.""

&amp;#x200B;

**Luno-**

""A leading **digital asset exchange and wallet** operating in major and emerging markets, Luno makes it safe and easy to buy, store and learn about cryptocurrencies."" This is basically where they get retail investors, from my understand Greyscale in mostly intuitional.

# Tying things together/ TL:DR

DCG is essentially a prime broker, hedge fund, crypto news/ media outlet and crypto trust/ ETF exchange. While also providing crypto wallets, a retail transaction platform, and mining/ Staking infrastructure. They have/ are building a monopoly over the crypto markets. They work with institutions, hedge funds, and market makers to lend and borrow crypto as an ""alternative liquidity for hedging"" source while trading OTC. They have major connections to the US government, NASDAQ, World banks, any many hedge funds that we already know are short on capital due to ""meme stocks"". These fuckers basically have their hand in every sector of the crypto market and are centralizing it by merging liquidity and hedging to stock market based companies through crypto.

look at the performance of Greyscales Trusts as more confirmation to this. They literally all 'pump and dump' between 12/2020 to now, or have an ""inception date"" between 2/26/2021- 7/14/2021 and follow the same 'pump and dump' trend...

**Final note:** I don't feel like this DD is fully complete. I believe there needs to be quite a bit more digging into DCG, its subsidiaries, and their connections- but I putting this out to hopefully get more eyes on the situation and more people digging into DCG. Also, this is not financial advice.

personalfinance,Should I transfer my monthly bills to a credit card if I want to build credit?,"I'm a teacher living in a southern state with an extremely low cost of living. I'm also currently living with my parents, but I plan to move out in December into a place where I will be paying roughly 6-700 dollars a month for rent. My current mandatory monthly bills are my student loan debts (~250) and my car insurance (~60). I bring home about 2400 a month. Due to living at home, I've managed to save 15000 dollars in the past year, my first time having a real job. 


My only real source of insecurity is my credit situation. My current FICO score is floating just north of 700, but I have literally no credit history barring my student loans, half being federal stafford loans and half being private loans. I'm afraid that this might prevent me from renting where I want to rent, and slightly more long term (within the next two to three years) prevent me from getting a favorable mortgage. 
 

Yesterday, I applied for and received my very first credit card, through Apple. The APR isn't great at 18%, but I don't intend to ever carry a balance month to month so I don't view that as an issue. 


What I would like to do with this credit card is transfer all of my recurring monthly payments onto it and immediately pay them off before the due date. Between my mandatories and the stuff I waste money on, this would likely be around 400 dollars a month.


My question: Would this be effective in helping me raise my FICO score and build a worthwhile credit history? Would the two to three years between now and when I'd like to buy a house be enough time for such a change to even be made?

Thanks a bunch in advance, and apologies if this isn't the right place for the question.",finance

personalfinance,Saving to buy a house,"Hi there,

I am a 24yr old that makes about $100k annual in a sales role. I invest heavily into the stock market (85-90% of my net worth) and have been since I started work about 2 years ago. My goal is to purchase a home after my lease is up next July (2022).

There are a few things at play here as I understand the real estate market is the hottest it’s ever been while the opposite goes for interest rates. With that in mind, my first question to Reddit would be my forecasted timing. Do you think it makes to buy a home in this type of market environment and do you have any predictions for next year around this time? 

My second question is in regard to preservation of capital. I don’t really want to liquidate my positions in the stock market and pay capital gains (most would be long term) to finance this project. But, with the market where it is today, is that possibly a good idea? If I don’t buy into the market, where do you think is the best spot to place new money coming in while I await the purchase of the home?

My wife and I purchased a home in May. It was an odd situation, but currently we sit with an interest rate of 4.5% on a 6 year balloon. We’re refinancing with the same bank to get a conventional 30 year hopefully this month or the next. 

I also own a truck that I’d like to sell now due to high used truck prices and I’ve found a lease on a new truck that is only $20/month than my current loan (my current truck will be paid off in 2 years). 

My logic is; if I can get close to what I paid for my truck now and get into a lease to own, that would be a win for my family. My concerns/questions are:

1) would a lease or refinance (whichever would come first) affect the other?

2) would a cash out refinance to pay off both our vehicles (about $20k) be the smarter option? We currently have about $30k in equity

3) miss out on this opportunity to sell during this market, let the rust on my truck that’s started accruing get worse and never see this much money back on my truck. 

Currently we live comfortably, but not without debt. I hate the idea of elongating my vehicle payment timeline, but this seemed like a good opportunity to me to upgrade my vehicle before it’s worth way less in the future.

The biggest thing I learned is in the steps on the website it says you must be 100% disabled on your VA rating form.  This is **NOT** accurate, the form must state that you are ""totally and permanently disabled.""  How these numbers can be different I have never fully understood but VA ratings are mostly a mystery to me.

Long Story Short, I moved to the US \[Chicago\] in December, with no credit history, no savings and just graduated from a university in Mexico, I'm a US citizen that's why I decided to move here, my plan is to live in this city at least for the next 3 years. In my second month I got my fist credit card (Discover It Cashback) with a $1000 credit line, finally after 6 months I got my **first Credit Score of 742 points**. Also, I have around $3500 in savings.  
A couple days ago, I got a new job and will start in mid August, went from $16/hr with little to no OT available to $31.5/hr with lots of OT available. My current job is 10 min on my bike and the new one will be \~40 min from my place on car (according to Google maps), when there's no traffic. My shift starts at 6am so I guess commute will be fast at 5am. I might need to find a place closer to my job in the future, but the first thing and a must is getting a car.  
I've been looking at used cars on Facebook marketplace within my budget &lt;$3500, only looking for Toyotas and hondas, but the ones I find have &gt;180,000 miles and a lot of cosmetic and rust issues, usually older than 2004.   
Also, I've been looking at Certified Pre-owned toyota corollas and honda civics 2012-2017 with &lt;80,000 miles that go from $12,000 to $17,000, that would require me to get an auto loan or financing (I don't know thats the difference) to afford it and pay it in 24-36 months. 

What would you recommend me? 

Get the Facebook car and pray that it won't break in the next couple of months after I buy it.   
Or, get the Certified Pre-owned car that usually comes with warranty and will last me longer. I know the insurance cost is a point to consider as well.   
Do you think with mi current credit score and budget can I get a good Interest rate to get a good car?  
I'm new to this car buying thing and I've read that the car prices have gone up because of the pandemic.

solar,Solar bids for aesthetics and price - SW Wisconsin - part 2,"Hi all!

This is a follow-up from my original post a few days ago. Got an additional quote being considered and finally nailed down the warranty details of quote 2.

Summary: Energy provider is We-Energies (SE Wisconsin region) and net metering is available in my area. None of these are factoring any battery storage as it is too costly at the moment. Willing to consider down the road when prices come down and better advancements happen. Panels would all be south facing on the front of roof and would encounter little to no shade. Aesthetics and price are factors as spouse needs to be on board with this venture! All 3 companies say they will be doing the install themselves and not subcontracting out.

1. One virtual/over the phone visit - 15x ELECTRONICS LG370N1K-A6 panels, 5.550 kWh, offset 102%. Enphase Energy micro inverters. Cash cost before incentives $18,759 or $3.38/watt. After federal and local incentives, net costs would be $13,381.66 or $2.41/watt. Meets my current demands, but not much room for growth if I want to get an EV. Sales person just notified me that by August the price will increase to 15% due to ""increase in material costs."" Talk about pressure.
2. Two in person site visits - 18x Tesla solar panels (aka Hanwha Q CELLS), 6.12kWh, offset 114%. SolarEdge inverter that comes with a built in L2 charger. Cash cost before incentives $20,403 or $3.33/watt. After federal and local incentives, net costs would be $14,598.22 or $2.39/watt. Tesla certified installer doing the install themselves thus their warranties on solar panels and Solar Edge inverter is 25 years. Buffers in some extra electricity usage now for dream items to have in the future, like an EV. Aesthetically, this is the one spouse and I like the most, but the panel degradation is the highest of the three quotes, being under warranty at .54%/year loss and getting roughly 85% by year 25. Is this something I should weigh in my decision?
3. Multiple emails and a phone call - 18x REC REC365AA Black panels, 6.57kWh, offset 116%. Enphase Energy IQ 7+ micro inverters. Cash cost before incentives $21,600 or $3.29/watt. After federal and local incentives, net costs would be $15,484 or $2.36/watt. Will be doing the install themselves. Aesthetic wise, I feel these are decent, but not my favorite. I love the stats of the panels and the degradation being 92% after 25 years or .25%/year loss, but upfront price might be a difficult to convince my spouse.

personalfinance,Realty and how to process funds,"My mother is selling her ranch home for $510,000 in the state of Oregon. She will be rolling over the funds to purchase a suburban home in the same county for $330,000 USD.  

She has a home loan for $90,000, which requires her to pay about $1,000 a month mortgage. I'm not sure what the APR is, but I'm guessing it's three or four percent.  The Realtors cut of the sale is 6%, which comes to about 30 grand. I am not sure what the closing costs are going to be and who will pay them 

1). Is there any reason that she should retain any of the mortgage debt for tax purposes or perhaps for the fact that the interest rate is so low?

She might need some of the resulting funds as a cushion to pay for repairs and updates in the new home, because it is being sold ""as is"".  We have not yet completed a formal inspection on the new place, but have passed one on her home.  Also, she is in her seventies and will stop working in the next year or two.  She has two sons that can assist her with finances, should it come to that.

2). Secondly, should she be splitting the proceeds of her sale into two separate checks for $255,000 each and depositing them into separate financial institutions?  I ask since Banks only FDIC insure for up to a quarter million dollars each?  Also, because there's going to be a two-week gap between closing the sale of her home and her moving into the new place.  She'll be sitting on the proceeds in the interim.

Forex,Countries that Depend on Foreign Capital,"When a country's central bank increases the interest rate, it tends to cause a deflationary pressure on the economy, as lending becomes more expensive, so businesses invest less, consumers have to pay more to obtain credit, etc. so there's less demand, leading to lower prices, and so on.

However, high interest rates also attract foreign investment in domestic securities that now offer those higher rates. So it seems that this would cause some capital inflow into the country.

Wouldn't this increased amount of credit/capital available in the economy offset the deflationary pressure caused by the high interest rate? (thus nullifying the intended effect of the monetary policy?) Could someone explain to be why a high interest rate generally succeeds in deflating the economy, even if it attracts foreign capital?

My guess is that foreign capital and inter-country investing are not significant parts of a country's economy. Hence, a country that is highly dependent on foreign capital might actually see the economy becoming more inflationary if they raise interest rates. Would this be correct",finance

personalfinance,"Choice between house in cheap small town, or buying/renting a condo in a bigger city?","I currently live in a small town where homes are often sold for 250-400k range.

First, is the 20% even necessary? Say if someone has 30k that would only come out to around 10% of the mortgage for a 300k house, which would mean higher mortgage and PMI etc. However, if you sit out prices or the interest rate can rise.

My second dilemma is I'm debating if it's worth it to buy a home in a cheaper, but more boring town with less job opportunities. Or, to buy or rent an apartment in NYC, Chicago, or Dallas. I looked at NYC and a lot of the HOA fees for bought apartments are around 500-800 a month just for the HOA. However, that just about evens out with rent. For example, if you were to buy a very small 200 square foot condo for around 350k for instance with a 1300 mortgage + 600 HOA and +200 property tax comes out to around 2100 which is about the same as what most rents are in NYC.

I'm also still, young late 20s. So, which of these would be the best option for the time being?

1. Buy a house before prices go up some more in a smaller town? This option would have the cheapest mortgage, but lowest paying jobs, and more boring lifestyle etc.

financialindependence,"First post. 7 years on this journey of saving, $755k NW","Hello fellow savers! Thought I would make a post on my finances here. Never made a formal post here; only have asked questions in megathreads. So here we go, follow with me on our journey to FI!

**Year 0**: +6k NW.  
Married! Saw the benefits of a joint expenses and account for us. We were full-time students (Nursing and Pharmacy) for the first year of marriage. We were employed part-time as externs. Income was roughly $15k together. We were both extremely lucky to have financial support into our schooling, which was relatively inexpensive and in-state but was a tremendous blessing to both have scholarships and family help to this point. We lived like students, in a $650/month apartment to save on costs. As a frugal spender, I took leadership over finances and purchases. We always paid off balances of credit cards to keep our credit score up to help with future goals of home ownership. Despite our decently high NW for no significant work history, we knew that if we spent more, our debt (which was increasing due to new student loans the final year) would dramatically increase and would be hard to reach our goals. We also knew that even though our emergency cash reserve was strong, we wanted to preserve that for future goals. We started to make a yearly goal of contributing 10%+ of our gross income to charity each year, which we have been keeping this goal since.

**Year 1**: -50k NW.  
Student loans! Negative net worth for the first time for us. But, good news, we graduated and passed boards! Time to get working. We both had goals of home ownership soon. We wanted to keep the status quo on living expenses in order to save for a down payment on a house. We both worked OT and made close to $210k income in our first year of employment. We had a car breakdown (totaled) within a month of employment, but we were able to afford a new (used) car to replace it. 13k for the car. Felt really good as it was the first big purchase we made together, and we paid cash, zero debt! We understood that our future goals would not allow for as much OT or as much pay, so we really tried to save for that down payment, and we payed off all of our debt! It was great to feel debt free. We started maxing out our 401k (pre-tax), Roth IRA, and invested a little on top. 

**Year 2**: +101k NW.  
No more loans, at all! Saved for down payment on a home, and bought a new home with a 20% down payment. 275k home was conservative with our (now 150k/yr) income. 3.25% fixed rate 30 year, and we had plans to pay that off early. Didn't do a lower interest+term mortgage in order to have a safe backup in case of more job changes. My job changed significantly, and was no longer receiving OT for extra hours (changed to salaried). Overall, it provided a much better work-life balance, which I think was best in the long run. But owning a home felt like one of the best decisions we have ever made. I would take that over renting our budget apartment any day! 

**Year 3**: +202k NW.  
Not much change! Income raised slightly to 160k. Aggressively saving! Worked to increase my emergency fund to where it was before our down payment, and now it is adequate for at least 8 months. We got a newer (used) car to replace one, and it had a low interest rate, only a 25k purchase so it was affordable to us.

**Year 4**: +322k NW.  
No changes, just working towards our next goal, which was a no-budget Europe trip. Income relatively the same. Made a car purchase of 10k.

**Year 5**: +406k NW.  
Income was the same. Was able to afford an incredible, month-long vacation to Europe! It was expensive, in the 10k-20k range, but we didn't budget exactly because it was a big goal for us that we didn't want to feel too constrained with. It was totally worth it, and it totally met our goals for the trip! We saved for our next goal, which was to have a child! Then Covid hit... We had similar income this year.  This Covid dip in the market and our NW (dropped 70k in a matter of days) really affirmed my belief in the power of the market to bounce back. It really only took a few months and we were back to where we were. I didn't increase savings during the dip. I was preserving money in case of a possible major health issue or pregnancy problem with us, especially during the pandemic. I am not sure I would have done it differently under the same circumstances.

**Year 6**: +520k NW.  
We have a baby! It was very difficult during Covid. Luckily, as essential healthcare workers, we saw increases in need to work. Our income went up to $175k. Baby expenses weren't as big as we thought? I'm really surprised we've kept up our rate of saving. We mostly have everything materially that we need at this point. We started saving for our child's college and their future.

**Year 7**: +755k NW.  
Holy market returns! Not much changed for expenses... Income reduced to $145k. Not doing extra work when we have a precious child to enjoy at home! Our cashflow is healthy. Still paying extra on home principal. Should be paid off 16 years early! We don't need to save extra at this point. Next goal might be another child? Major house improvements/renovations? We will see! 

I do not mind answering questions. Hopefully this means something to somebody? I have been able to share our story with others close to us to encourage them to save early. Hopefully you will too!",finance

cardano,"Cardano Rumor Rundown July 23, 2021","Hey Everyone!

Let's go...

Newly covered today: 

1. The mainstream press is suddenly realizing the behavioral economics tools that a central bank with CBDCs could wield. There is definitely a universe where this becomes a very dystopian and jarring introduction to virtual currencies for the mainstream. [https://twitter.com/NeerajKA/status/1418168477429424135](https://twitter.com/NeerajKA/status/1418168477429424135)
2. Wolfram CEO, John Woodard, drops a guest article with IOHK on NFT liveminting. The article seems to have a good amount of focus on the community building potential of NFTs. I think that could be a big growth area for the future. [https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/07/22/wolfram-and-cardano-build-communities-with-nfts-and-liveminting/](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/07/22/wolfram-and-cardano-build-communities-with-nfts-and-liveminting/)
3. IOHK has released its Conclave paper on collective stakepools.  [https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/742.pdf](https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/742.pdf)

Previously Covered but still interesting:

1. Reuters reports on an EU digital identity wallet project. [https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/eu-step-up-digital-push-with-digital-identity-wallet-2021-06-01/?taid=60b6e171efd84f0001b64ae1&amp;utm\_campaign=trueAnthem:+Trending+Content&amp;utm\_medium=trueAnthem&amp;utm\_source=twitter](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/eu-step-up-digital-push-with-digital-identity-wallet-2021-06-01/?taid=60b6e171efd84f0001b64ae1&amp;utm_campaign=trueAnthem:+Trending+Content&amp;utm_medium=trueAnthem&amp;utm_source=twitter)
2. Vitalik is saying it’s highly unlikely we see ETH 2.0 before late 2022. I’m guessing that means mid 2023 which will be after two years of Cardano slaughtering the entire ETH user base. Things are looking so bad that Vitalik says he doesn’t even like using the ETH 2.0 label anymore since he knows the changes will be more incremental. This is what early capitulation sounds like guys. [https://cointelegraph.com/news/even-vitalik-buterin-is-surprised-at-just-how-long-eth2-is-taking](https://cointelegraph.com/news/even-vitalik-buterin-is-surprised-at-just-how-long-eth2-is-taking)
3. Cardano-Nervos cross-chain bridge to be built. This would be at least the second cross-chain bridge after the Cardano-AGI bridge. [https://www.coindesk.com/cardano-nervos-force-bridge-network-first](https://www.coindesk.com/cardano-nervos-force-bridge-network-first)

5. Binance has 63 stakepools charging 6%. Please stop paying so much for the right to stake your ADA. You don’t have to pay that much. You have a huge number of better options. You are literally giving away your ADA rewards to a large corporation. It’s easy: just download the Yoroi Chrome extension, send your ADA there, and pick from the 2k+ available stakepools right inside Yoroi. [https://twitter.com/BraveHeartStak3/status/1401204563189940231](https://twitter.com/BraveHeartStak3/status/1401204563189940231) [https://adapools.org/groups/binance-20](https://adapools.org/groups/binance-20) [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.emurgo&amp;hl=en\_US&amp;gl=US](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.emurgo&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US)
6. Here’s a good Emurgo blog article on the use of Emurgo Trace in the Oil and gas industry. [https://twitter.com/emurgo\_io/status/1402339278097502210](https://twitter.com/emurgo_io/status/1402339278097502210)

10. Cardano gets more positive coverage on the Nasdaq website with a second article following the one from April 7 earlier this year. [https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/be-part-of-a-historic-crypto-moment-with-cardano-2021-06-08](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/be-part-of-a-historic-crypto-moment-with-cardano-2021-06-08)
11. Prof. Aggelos Kiayias releases an article on a tri-coin system called Stablefees that could fix the problem of appreciating transaction fees in crypto. [https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/06/10/stablefees-and-the-decentralized-reserve-system/](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/06/10/stablefees-and-the-decentralized-reserve-system/)

14. Zach Guzman and Mike Novogratz get an opportunity to prove once again how extremely threatened they are by the fact that they can’t frontrun Cardano at this point. [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1404100510525841408](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1404100510525841408)
15. John O’Connor appeared on the Disrupt Network Podcast. [bit.ly/3znqyB7](https://t.co/26advBvFku?amp=1)
16. President of Tanzania calls on the central bank to prepare for the adoption of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. I wonder what crypto ecosystem already has experience working with an African government on a big crypto project and has partnered with a mobile company that is already bringing connectivity to rural Tanzania? [https://twitter.com/DocumentingBTC/status/1404126444863766533](https://twitter.com/DocumentingBTC/status/1404126444863766533)
17. With exploits like this one being all too common in the legacy smart contract networks, we’re not even going to have sell the Cardano use case for DeFi. The competitor networks have already made the case that something better must be on the way. [https://twitter.com/zapper\_fi/status/1404429179794362369](https://twitter.com/zapper_fi/status/1404429179794362369)

20. While renewable energy is certainly a wonderful thing, there may be a problem with your technology when your path to compete on clean energy consumption involves you talking about harnessing the power of a whole series of volcanoes. Maybe just use fewer volcano’s and more proof-of-stake? [https://twitter.com/\_eLaPs\_/status/1404125569093029889](https://twitter.com/_eLaPs_/status/1404125569093029889) [https://twitter.com/gladstein/status/1402718041557725184](https://twitter.com/gladstein/status/1402718041557725184)
21. The Charles/Lex Fridman podcast has dropped. This is a big deal. This is a fairly mainstream podcast with over 1 million subscribers. [https://youtu.be/FKh8hjJNhWc](https://youtu.be/FKh8hjJNhWc)
22. The bank of England is getting very serious about how it “may wish to limit migration” of money from the legacy system to stablecoins. Wow. Just another example of why it’s such an asset (no pun intended) that Cardano is prepared for regulation. [https://twitter.com/CaitlinLong\_/status/1405712468823842816](https://twitter.com/CaitlinLong_/status/1405712468823842816)

24. Runtime Verification (architects of K Framework which powers Cardano’s IELE &amp; KEVM) raised $5.3MM in a round that included Cardano’s C Fund. [https://runtimeverification.com/blog/runtime-verification-raises-5-3-million-to-advance-blockchain-security](https://runtimeverification.com/blog/runtime-verification-raises-5-3-million-to-advance-blockchain-security) [https://twitter.com/RosuGrigore/status/1405917218035097600](https://twitter.com/RosuGrigore/status/1405917218035097600)
25. It’s a good sign that the top two crypto communities are spending so much time talking negatively about Cardano. You only focus your hatred on that which is most threatening. I’m glad to see we’re the biggest threat on their radar. [https://twitter.com/nic\_\_carter/status/1405194146063736840](https://twitter.com/nic__carter/status/1405194146063736840)
26. We are crushing all the competitors in terms of assets staked! [https://twitter.com/CryptoDiffer/status/1405854686209622018](https://twitter.com/CryptoDiffer/status/1405854686209622018)
27. All 345,501 of the people who have watched the Lex Fridman/Charles episode as of writing are realizing that Cardano could be the first project to put voting on the blockchain in a U.S. state. [https://www.atalaprism.io/app](https://www.atalaprism.io/app)
28. It looks like the second biggest ETH stakepool or it's custody provider has lost it’s users private keys to $75MM in ETH. Cardano doesn’t have this problem. We get to keep custody of our crypto because we found a better way than slashing. [https://stakehound.com/blog-post/fireblocks-eth-2-key-management-incident/](https://stakehound.com/blog-post/fireblocks-eth-2-key-management-incident/) [https://twitter.com/JamesSpediacci/status/1407465311180255236](https://twitter.com/JamesSpediacci/status/1407465311180255236)
29. Draft table of contents for Mastering Cardano has been revealed. [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1407165366355124225](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1407165366355124225)
30. COTI (a project with very close ties to Cardano) is coming to Ledger. [https://medium.com/cotinetwork/coti-native-is-coming-to-ledger-c56b04df1253](https://medium.com/cotinetwork/coti-native-is-coming-to-ledger-c56b04df1253)
31. The June Cardano 360 is currently available on Youtube. [https://youtu.be/al5m14299ww](https://youtu.be/al5m14299ww)
32. We saw segments on various newer partner entities like Nervos, Orion Protocol, and Revuto. Nervos is a UTXO proof-of-work blockchain which is building a cross-chain bridge with Cardano so that you can use your ADA on Nervos dApps and vice versa. Interoperability is a big theme for Nervos and they plan to have a working testnet within a month. Orion Protocol is building a terminal that will allow for decentralized non-custodial trading across centralized and decentralized exchanges. They say this would not require you to KYC or even have an account with any of these exchanges. Revuto is an online subscription management service that recently completed a $10MM token sale on Cardano.
33. It was also revealed that Wolfram Labs, COTI, and IOHK have a three-way partnership (a ménage à tech) to build an NFT auction site. The people from Wolfram were talking about very interesting things including live minting during streaming events and automated upload to IPFS. COTI will be building out auction and bidding mechanisms in ADAPay.
34. Professor Aggelos Kiayias gave us an update on research including that Ouroboros Chronos and Hydra papers have both been accepted into conferences/journals. Chronos will provide Cardano with a global concept of time that doesn’t rely on any outside timekeeper. Prof. Kiayias also pointed out that Hydra is distinguishable from other layer two protocols in that the scripting language is identical to that of the base layer in Cardano such that any dApp that can run on Cardano will run on the Hydra L2. This is a huge plus and superior to many other layer two solutions in other ecosystems where the base layer dApps will not run on layer two. Finally, the Mithril paper has been submitted for peer review. It will provide Cardano light wallets with Succinct Non-interactive Arguments of Knowledge that will give us the best of both worlds: no delays for syncing as in full node wallets while still preserving trustlessness.
35. Finally, the Goguen Summit will be in late September. Sign up now at [summit.cardano.org](http://summit.cardano.org/).
36. The Fed is once again STRONGLY signalling to us that they are going to regulate stablecoins. The Fed is also specifically calling out Tether for the first time. You need to be thinking about how stablecoin regulation might affect your favorite Cardano DeFi or other project. [https://twitter.com/CaitlinLong\_/status/1408500265397985282](https://twitter.com/CaitlinLong_/status/1408500265397985282) [https://twitter.com/CaitlinLong\_/status/1408572624125534212](https://twitter.com/CaitlinLong_/status/1408572624125534212)
37. People are starting to realize that the Stakehound private key loss in ETH may attract unwanted regulatory attention to Ethereum 2.0 while this problem could never have occurred in Cardano. Also, only a few days later another ETH stakepool (this time SharedStake...the sixth biggest ETH Stakepool) allegedly experiences a rugpull that some are valuing at over $30MM. This is another problem that could not happen in Cardano staking. It feels like we stepped into the ring, they rang the bell, and ETH just started punching itself in the head. Eventually it’s going to KO itself.

38. Here’s another great Cardano data site. This one is from the Cardano Fans stakepool. [https://datastudio.google.com/u/0/reporting/3136c55b-635e-4f46-8e4b-b8ab54f2d460/page/r2LQC](https://datastudio.google.com/u/0/reporting/3136c55b-635e-4f46-8e4b-b8ab54f2d460/page/r2LQC)
39. John O’Connor of IOHK points out that France still controls the monetary policy of 14 countries in Africa. There is definitely a built in market on the continent for a project that delivers monetary sovereignty to the people. [https://twitter.com/jjtoconnor/status/1408978882129272832](https://twitter.com/jjtoconnor/status/1408978882129272832)

50. Cardano is now a small part of Grayscale’s Digital Large Cap Fund. They actually sold off current holdings in other coins to buy ADA. This is big for institutional adoption! [https://twitter.com/Grayscale/status/1410945118228692994](https://twitter.com/Grayscale/status/1410945118228692994)
51. Catalyst Fund 4 results are here. [https://adapulse.io/fund-4-results-are-here/](https://adapulse.io/fund-4-results-are-here/)
52. Robert Kornacki of dcSpark releases an article on why every Cardano dApp will use NFTs. The article contains some very interesting discussion on smart contracts in the EUTXO context including language instructing that “UTXOs have smart contracts attached to them and not the other way around” and “\[...\]the simplest way to think about it is that when a UTXO is created it has the option to have a smart contract attached to it.” [https://medium.com/dcspark/every-eutxo-dapp-will-use-nfts-and-heres-why-fd87e6a8c9a6](https://medium.com/dcspark/every-eutxo-dapp-will-use-nfts-and-heres-why-fd87e6a8c9a6)
53. A very interesting medium article on the concurrency problem in eUTxO blockchains such as Cardano. (Article by Occam Fi....thanks to Muggy Pool for sending it my way).

98. Notable news for upcoming Cardano DeFi projects. There may be slightly less competition in the “get a return on your crypto assets” game very soon. The New Jersey AG’s office has delivered a cease and desist letter to BlockFi. The AG’s press release cited BlockFi’s interest bearing deposit accounts as unregistered securities and also mentioned the lack of FDIC or SPIC insurance for it’s depositors. This leaves some lingering questions for Cardano DeFi projects that might be planning to accept deposits or other transfers of value and offering a return of sorts. You could argue that these projects are decentralized where BlockFi was not. But, the AG’s press release seems to cite decentralization as one of the risks of DeFi projects. Also, as a practical matter, there is a question whether decentralization will be a good shield from regulators since many of these projects have companies and real humans with faces and names behind them unlike a truly anonymous founder such as Satoshi Nakamoto.

investing,Can a company create new shares?,"Tldr; Is it possible for a company to create new shares that are not in it's treasury?

I own stock in the company I work for. It's a micro company and it trades OTC. 

Recently shareholders (myself included) voted to allow employees to buy and own company shares at a small discount during certain periods (after earnings reports etc). The document reads like the company will create new shares out of nowhere to sell to the employees. I didn't know a company could create new shares. Wouldn't the company have to have equity to sell as new shares? 

I'm using my company as an example but I'm more interested in the broader market. As an investor do I need to worry about a company creating new shares and diluting the stock? I'm not worried about a company selling existing shares from it's treasury and diluting the free float. I look at the value of the entire company, not just the float. But if a company can create new shares that are not in the Treasury that's like the fed printing new dollars. It decreases the actual value of each share and would be more like stealing.

But with the low-ish interest rates, I’ve decided not to. 

Any other advice to tackle this loan is appreciated!

I have 5 separate student loans through Nelnet (see breakdown below) totaling to $17,496. Each loan was from a separate years in college. 

Nelnet’s payment structure takes the minimum payment that I pay ($240 per month) and allocates funds to each loan (interest and principle).  Before covid, I was paying an additional $100 to the loan that was incurring the most interest.

software,"Most accurate search engine (all I know are crap). Please Google, don't censor my question","So it's been some years I've noticed all search engines I know are becoming more and more inaccurate and I have to spend more and more of my time scrolling through pages and pages of content to answer even the most basic questions. 

Today begins the Tokyo 2021 Olympics. I just wished to know a list of all the countries that will be competing in order of number of athletes, so I searched ""which countries have the most athletes Olympics"". Pretty straightforward, don't you think? But, because absolutely every search engine I know (Google, bing, duckduckgo, ecosia, startpage) put ""relevancy"" and ""freshness"" above all else (that equals to: how mainstream the pages are and how fresh the content is - so a freaking NBC article talking about effing medals of some effing US state I don't care about keeps appearing over and over), none of these search engines can't answer this simple question. To add insult to injury, they show sometimes 5-10 adds of things unrelated (or just related to only one word of the search) to search so I have to scroll even more. 

Already tried to use every advanced search mechanism these search engines offer. To top off all my anger, if you search ""most accurate search engines"", they will only show you the articles which put their search engine at first. Try yourself. Nothing works. I've been pretty frustrated. 

All of this make me feel I am a effing dictatorship of these tech giants who do their best to force ads and their products down your throat without even giving a good product in return. Those who say DuckDuckGo came to combat that are lying to themselves because it's the same crap. So, please, do anyone know a search engine or any website that please can answer the question ""which countries have the most athletes"" so I can answer my mom? (who has been waiting for me to find that on Google for about 2 hours and I've been wasting my work time to do this - I am autonomous/work for myself, don't worry, I am the only one who has been f-ed in this story - I am currently considering abandoning my other projects just to program a search engine that actually give me results that I want, is it that difficult?

personalfinance,Private equity or stay in current role?,"Hi,

Have an opportunity to join an early startup as a junior VP.  Currently in an engineering role at a larger company.  I'm at a senior individual contributor role in my current company but it's clear they aren't moving me into the C suite.  There is talk of a supervisor role in 3ish years.  I think I am very strong technically and have warned against some dumbass moves, which they ignored and I was later vindicated as being right... but nobody likes to be told they are wrong.  I'm kind of tired of having a Director who is a moron, whose mistakes are costing my company tens of millions a year.

The compensation in hand would be about $50,000 a year less, but closer to $100,000 a year for the next two years as a result of stock vesting.  Over a 5 year window,  somewhere around $350,000 in the hole.  About $200,000 of that is 401k match  (very good at current company - stellar, vs poor at startup)

My equity upside could be from 0 to $1 million.  Talks of maybe getting it to $2 million if the PE investment doubles.  The terms favor the PE company, so my upside is unlikely to be a lot more than that.

There's a part of me that isn't sure if this is a good deal.  I asked for more salary and equity and was rebuffed on the salary but they added a sliver of equity.  Pretty clear they aren't going to throw more into the pot and I will always be a junior VP role relative to the founders.  Not sure what value to place on being a VP in a startup and entering the private equity space.

dogecoin,An Austrian Economist's due diligence on Dogecoin,"I tend to subscribe the the Austrian school of economics who's biggest contribution to the field is the subjective theory of value, but also argues for a very different banking system with a commodity backed currency.  People are becoming interested many different cryptocurrencies because they are seen as a store of value or a hedge against inflation. Dogecoin is no exception. What makes Dogecoin exceptional is that it's community is pushing it into competition with the dollar.

The Federal Reserve Note is the current incarnation of the dollar. This fiat money system evolved out of prior incarnations of the dollar.  The Brenton-Woods system was established in the aftermath of World War II. This gave the dollar a value of $35 an ounce of gold.  Prior to the $35 an ounce gold standard, the dollar was devalued in 1933 from $20 an ounce.   This long train of financial malfeasance has lead to a community of people seeking an alternative from the enslavement of the masters of the money supply, with Elon Musk leading the charge.  The Austrian School of Economics has long predicted a sudden precipitous drop in the value of the dollar if current Federal Reserve policy isn't changed. While the Austrian school has been accused of basing too many things on conjecture, they do predict economic events with remarkable consistency and aren't easy to ignore when they warn of a bubble.  Consider Dr. Michael Burry has knowledge of the Austrian school, and used it to his advantage in ""The Big Short""

So what all does this have to do with Dogecoin?

Dogecoin is on the verge of becoming a competing currency.  A crack-up boom is a phenomenon described by economist Ludwig von Misses (1881-1973) that happens when the recognition of the decline of the value of a currency becomes so apparent that most people will exchange that currency for any real goods regardless of it's price with an expectation that the same thing will cost more tomorrow. This can include other currencies.

The supply of any fiat or crypto currency is a major factor in determining it's value. Gold is worth more than Silver because there's more silver than gold. The same is true of any currency. This merits a comparison of Dogecoin to the U.S. Dollar. 

The supply of Dogecoin is easy to look up on Coinbase, and as of today is 130.5 Billion Dogecoin. The supply of dollars in circulation on the other hand is not so clear cut.  According to the Bank for International Settlements, the total amount is about $5 Trillion, but according to the CIA, the total amount is $80 trillion if you include ""broad money.""  The Federal Reserve's website reports the M3 money supply at a little over $20 trillion.  There's also the national debt figure, which measures how much money has been borrowed and spent plus interest.  That is approaching $30 Trillion.  So, it hard to pin down exactly how many dollars are out there.  I don't think anyone has an exact figure. But, for the sake of making the math really easy, let's go with 26.1 Trillion dollars out in circulation so that I have a basis for comparison and what could happen. Does it bother anyone that we have to guess at it a little?  It bothers me.

A ratio of 26.1 Trillion to 130.5 billion reduces to a nice clean ratio of 200 to 1.

So let's say that the ratio is something close to that. 

But what does it mean, and why is this useful to know?

One thing to consider about Dogecoin is that it's inflation model is linear.  The size of the supply of Dogecoin grows at fixed rate over time and becomes a decreasing percentage of the overall supply over time. The Federal Reserve states generally that 2% annual inflation is ideal and sometimes it can even exceed that. This model produces an exponential curve on long periods of time.  The national debt is currently on pace to be near $40 Trillion buy the end of Biden's first Term, but that assumes that the Federal Reserve is not forced to raise interest rates to defend the dollar. The national debt in can be used as a tool to estimate money supply expansion as long as the interest rates remain near zero. It's not like this money is coming from a lender.  It is being inflated into existence. This means you can expect the dollar to add 10 Trillion new units, while Dogecoin will only add 20 Billion new units over the same period of time. 

The demand for dollars today is much higher than Dogecoin. Most people expect to receive a paycheck in dollars, and the dollar is the reserve currency of the world and can be used in some countries without having to exchange for local currency.   However, over the next few years, symptoms of a crack-up boom will emerge if something isn't done.  Some signs are already showing.  Demand for Dogecoin will increase as it is more commonly accepted in retail mediums.  As the dollar's value begins to slide, more adopters come to the field. 

This is where Dogecoin becomes a major player, as it is being developed into a means of trade and exchange. The end result of a crack-up boom is a crash in the demand for the subject currency.  Why would you want something that is losing value rapidly and might be on it's way to being worthless?This will be a difficult period of time in history for some people, but for Dogecoin hodlers, it has the potential to be one of the largest wealth transfers in the history of Earth. 

Dogecoin's price action in the spring is reminiscent of an early adoption bubble similar to what happened in the dotcom bubble that burst in 2000. Outside of the day to day price fluctuations, Dogecoin is now in it's early S curve phase.  Most people are buying it and few are selling and/or spending it.  Anticipation of it's future value is high which is why it's spend rate remains low in comparison to the dollar that has lower future value expectation. 

As a currency, Dogecoin has a long way to go to universal adoption similar to what the dollar enjoys today.  While Dogecoin can be used to pay for some knick-knacks or Mavericks Tickets, Dogecoin is not in use for payments in the supply chain of things.  One example is that Dogecoin is still useless for paying utility bills. Another problem is large corporations that most people know cannot use Dogecoin to obtain raw materials to manufacture products.  Coca-Cola has to buy sugar constantly, for example. They are not buying sugar with Dogecoin.

A crack-up boom offers a unique opportunity for a replacement system to emerge if the dollar is destroyed and people seek alternatives. This event will result in changes in our society that will be on the same scale as the end of World War II, only it will be more chaotic for Americans in America because hyperinflation is self-inflicted and wreaks havoc on the domestic economy.  

Dogecoin could be recognized by state governments as legal tender as they scramble in the wake of a currency collapse to restore order.  The states will also find themselves inundated in land ownership disputes because of the collapse of the surrounding dollar denominated debt structure.  The federal government will be completely helpless because they have no effective operating currency and the basis for taxation collapsed.

In this worst-case scenario, states will have a lot more power to change things and this is where a paradigm shift to cryptocurrencies can occur most rapidly.

Consider a potential scenario in which the dollar's value dissipates rapidly.  In price action, Dogecoin would start to become more and more expensive in dollars as would everything else, but then the dollar price becomes more and more meaningless as the crack-up boom progresses. 10000 Dogecoin becomes more important for obtaining goods and services than selling for dollars on an exchange.

With the economy decimated, demand for goods and services crashes at first and mass deflation takes place when no one can afford anything. Then then new currency begins to take over and conditions improve once prices have corrected to the new market condition. 

It is at this stage that real purchasing power discovery will begin for Dogecoin, as people begin to adjust beyond the singularity of a crack-up boom and trade with what assets are available. When selecting a replacement currency, the properties of the currency give quantifiable measures that can be used to calculate the changes.   This is where that 200 : 1 ratio of dollars to Dogecoin comes in.  If you pack an economy the size of the United States into a currency the size of Dogecoin, and have a linear inflation rate built into a currency, it's a recipe for price stability, sustainable economic growth, and a high standard of living. It is in this way that Dogecoin emulates commodity money, because the gold and silver supply did expand over the years through mining. Much like Dogecoin, it's supply growth was linear.  

Dogecoin's main competition in a post crack-up boom world will be silver and gold, and other precious metals. Most don't want to have to carry around a lot of heavy coins and would still prefer the advantages of an electronic transactions. Establishing a real Dogecoin to Silver/Gold ratio independent of the dollar is a real challenge, but some inferences can be made from the dollar to gold ratio.  

To put this in perspective, consider the pricing structure as it existed in the 1920s. Rent was about $60 on average.  The average income was about $275 a month. That's about 22% of the average income. At the time, rent prices represented 3 ounces of gold because the dollar was defined in such a way that put the price of an ounce of gold at $20.  When you compare the price of rent to the price of gold, rent has actually fallen to right around one ounce of gold today. The average person made about 13.5 ounces of gold per month in 1920.   Today's median income is about $2600 a month, and gold is about $1800 an ounce.  This is only 1.44 ounces of gold per month! Rent prices in California are higher and might be 1.25 ounces of gold per month there, where as places in the Midwest are cheaper and can be had for 0.5 ounces of gold.    The decline in earnings however is very ugly, and represents all the stolen purchasing power of the dollar since it's decline began in 1933.  This is a decline of about 90% in earnings as weighted in gold.  A significant portion of this damage has been done in the past 20 years.

This where it's clear to me that in Musk we should trust. Having a replacement currency ready that can be spent to buy food and gasoline is critical. Dogecoin could literally save us if it's ready for that before the crash of the purchasing power of the dollar goes into overdrive.   

It is very likely in my mind that the cryptocurrency market diverted some of these dollars away from gold. Without cryptocurrency, the demand for precious metals would be even higher. This means that gold could be priced in lower than expected than in previous variations of governments that hyperinflated their currency.  The most famous example of hyperinflation is the Weimar Republic.  From 1918-1924, the Weimar Republic inflated it's currency to pay war reparations, but things didn't get really bad until 1923.  Inflation of the Weimar Republic's mark started happening in 1918, but the pricing structure lagged behind the expansion of the money supply at first, and then it all caught up to them after a few years.  It was here we learned that expansion of the money supply, or monetary inflation has a gestation period.

The United States has been on the same monetary expansion trajectory and supply growth curve as the Weimar Republic since 2020. All the spending that took place to combat the pandemic was pay for with monetary expansion. If the current administration does not slow down the spending, and passes a $3.5 Trillion spending bill, the dollar will continue its march towards destruction.  

If Dogecoin is to replace the dollar as a viable medium of exchange and support for the flow of goods through the entire economy, the early adopters will benefit the most from it.  People stuck with dollars will have to work for whatever medium of exchange becomes the winner. If this is Dogecoin, the holders that bought it with dollars will become a new breed of capitalists as their prior currency deleverages into the purchasing power of Dogecoin and Dogecoin becomes the base of capital and trade of an economy. 

The housing market will have a very difficult adjustment to a non-fractional reserve currency with tight credit, but the result will be lower prices when demand comes down from an economy stripped of loose credit policy.  

My final conclusion is that if you buy some Dogecoin, be prepared to wait 10 years before it really starts to pay off. 

I hope you enjoyed this ride through a catastrophic scenario.  The Federal Reserve is stuck between a frying pan and a snake pit. The frying pan is low interest rates and easy money credit policy.  If the FED stays here forever, they eventually will start to burn.  The snake pit is if the Federal Reserve reverses course and raises interest rates drastically to defend the dollar. This would cause serious damage to the economy and a significant recession/correction would ensue. There would be a very bad year, but if the government cut spending and got out the way, the economy would recover after a sharp deleveraging contraction. Growth would return in a year or two if they just let it happen quickly so it would be over. 

The Federal Reserve's interference in the market is what allows things like dark pools and price manipulation like what you see in AMC stock. These mechanisms wouldn't exist in a non-fractional reserve currency system.

Dogecoin and other crypto currencies are part of a multi-pronged strategy to preserve capital in a world where the dollar is being intentionally debased. Dogecoin should be thought of in the same vein as buying gold or silver bullion, with no expectation of converting it back into Federal Reserve Notes.

The only risk that cryptocurrency carries that Gold and Silver do not would be a solar event or electromagnetic pulse that disrupts the underlying electronics infrastructure.  In that case, there is no way that a computer based currency system would survive.  

Gold and silver bugs that have 3-5% of asset diversification into cryptocurrency is acceptable risk.  If Dogecoin realizes Elon Musk's dreams of being a multi-planetary currency, any investment today will have a huge payoff in the future.

personalfinance,When is the right time to refinance?,"I bought a house in mid 2019 after graduating college for $104k. I currently still have $92,000 left on the loan. However, my ""projected"" value due to the home market is now 138k-150k. 30 year @ 4.25%.  Monthly mortgage of $718 which includes mortgage insurance property tax etc.

My credit score is now 760+ and I was wondering how people determine when refinancing makes sense. Does it make sense simply when interest rates drop and the value spikes due to the market? Or are there other factors I need to take into consideration?

I'm considering paying off my student loan first; I have only $100 to go on it and could easily wipe it out.  The one thing holding me back is that it's the oldest account contributing to the length of my credit history (this account is from 2005) and paying it off would shorten my credit history.  

Another account I'm considering paying off now is a closed credit card with my credit union.  The current balance is $339, I'm paying $50 a month, and the interest rate is 3.25%.

Inflation should be on fire given FED printing 120B in cash every month. That is FED buys MBS 40M + 80B of US Treasuries or 120M and pays for the Debt with Digital Dollars.

FED increased it's balance sheet to 8T vs 2007-08 Great Financial Recession FED balance sheet was half est 4T.

Reason Inflation is not on fire is 78M baby boomers are retiring or quarter of the population. They are and will not spend like they use to which is deflationary. FED and bought off press do not use that term but that is what is happening. Even with free money and 0% FFR as the Baby Boomers start to die off 20M of them own homes. Their kids do not want the house so we will see them dump or fire sell these homes. Free money has created another bubble in home price appreciation. It will be like a frog boiling in the pot of water it happen gradually but it will impact trillions in home equity. Ask Case Shiller or [www.hsdent.com](https://www.hsdent.com/) Harry Dent.

personalfinance,Balance Transfer Offers,"Anyone else notice the glut of balance transfer offers from major banks including Citi, JP Morgan Chase and Bank of America? Even my Am Ex card is offering balance transfers! How valuable are they and what criteria should you use to evaluate?

Background

- Promotional APR balance transfers allow cardholders to move a higher interest balance from another card to lower interest (usually 0% APR) while paying one time transfer charge (usually 3-6% transfer amount)

- The catch: Depending on the length of the promotional APR period, the interest savings may not cover the one time charge.

How do I know if it’s worth it?

- Calculate: Divide transfer fee by term years of promotional APR to find annualized cost. This is effectively what you are paying to borrow the money.

For example, $3,000 balance transfer offer for a 5% one-time fee and 0% APR through May 2022 incurs an effective annual rate of 6% (5% fee / 0.83 years).

The same offer with April 2023 promotional APR incurs an effective annual rate of 2.875% (5% fee / 1.75 years)

Borrowing money at 2.875% is a much a better deal, while 6% is less of a bargain in today’s low interest rate environment.

What are banks offering?

In my current card lineup, I’m seeing 0% offers from March 2022 to April 2023 APR term (8-21 months) and 3 to 5% transfer cost. The difference in these offers is 1.75% to 7.5% effective annual rate!",finance

Bitcoin,Greener Days Are Coming – 4 Reasons To Be Optimistic About Bitcoin for the Next Months,"After quickly falling below the psychological barrier of $30K, the price of Bitcoin has just rebounded to above $32K. However, it is not certain that the price of Bitcoin will climb back up to $40K quickly. Several resistances will have to be broken for this to happen.

The current situation with the price of Bitcoin moving sideways between $29.5K and $34K could continue throughout the summer.

Even so, the fact that the Bitcoin price has held up like this after the $30K mark was lost suggests that the market has already been purged of weak hands over the past few weeks. The remaining players are well aware of the opportunity that a Bitcoin around $30K represents.

Their goal is to accumulate as much BTC as possible in this price range in anticipation of what lies ahead for Bitcoin in the next months. By taking a step back to see the bigger picture, you will be able to understand why greener days are ahead for Bitcoin in the coming months.

In what follows, I highlight the 4 main reasons why I think so.

The Bitcoin network continues to grow
Since the Bitcoin price crash in May 2021, many observers have made the mistake of focusing solely on the price of Bitcoin. This short-sightedness prevents them from seeing the bigger picture.

The only thing these people see is that the price of Bitcoin is currently 50% below its April 2021 All-Time High (ATH) near $65K.

That being said, you must learn to focus on the fundamentals of Bitcoin. These are far more telling of Bitcoin's long-term success than the short-term volatility of its price.

If you make this crucial intellectual effort, you will see that the Bitcoin network continues to grow month after month since the beginning of 2021:

The number of users of the Bitcoin network has reached an ATH in the past month. This number is far more important than the current price of Bitcoin. Bitcoin adoption continues to grow block by block. This is something Bullish for the coming months.

Bitcoin's Hash Rate is already rebounding
China's ban on Bitcoin has caused many miners in several parts of China to shut down their equipment. The Bitcoin Hash Rate has inevitably suffered as a result. This caused a major drop that had some observers unnecessarily worried.

Since then, we have seen the great exodus of Bitcoin mining from China to the West.

What seemed to some to be something ultra-negative for Bitcoin is in fact something extremely Bullish. This ban on Bitcoin mining in China will do two key things:

Better decentralization of the Bitcoin Hash Rate around the world.

A major improvement in the share of electricity from renewable energy sources used by the Bitcoin network.

Two problems used by Bitcoin's opponents to denigrate it will be solved in the process. You can see that the Bitcoin Hash Rate is already rebounding strongly:

The macroeconomic environment remains favorable to Bitcoin
The ultra-aggressive monetary policies pursued by the central banks of the major economies to combat the effects of COVID-19 on the economy have highlighted the benefits of the Bitcoin system more than ever.

Bitcoin brings back to light the virtues of quantitative hardening. This is in contrast to the quantitative easing that the Fed and the European Central Bank have been practicing unreasonably for years.

This possibility given to central banks to print as much fiat money out of thin air as they deem necessary is the original sin of a system that will end up collapsing sooner or later.

While the Fed has been denying the obvious for months, it is finally starting to acknowledge that inflation will be a problem in the months ahead. It has reached 5.4% in June 2021 in America, and for many observers, including the CEO of BlackRock, the problem is systemic.

This inflation will remain at high levels for a long time. This will benefit Bitcoin as a safe haven to protect what you own. More and more investors will come to seize this opportunity in this macroeconomic environment that clearly favors Bitcoin.

On-chain data confirms that the market has already been cleansed of weak hands
Since the beginning of June 2021, a trend has emerged: whales have started accumulating Bitcoin again. Those players who know how to take the long view have realized that the big opportunity with Bitcoin is now.

This trend has even accelerated since early July 2021:

ImageBitcoin Supply held by entities with Balance 1K - 10K - Source: Glassnode

Investors with at least 1,000 BTC added over 96K BTC to their holdings. While the weak hands were selling and hesitating to take advantage of the current opportunity, the whales were buying fear.

The fact that Bitcoin did not see its price collapse after breaking the psychological barrier of $30K is also something that tends to confirm that the market has already been purged of weak hands.

Greener days are therefore expected for Bitcoin in the coming months. It is only a matter of time in my opinion.

Final Thoughts
It is always difficult to know when the bottom has been reached after a Bitcoin price crash like the one we experienced in May 2021. However, there are several indications that greener days are within reach.

The great opportunity with Bitcoin for the next few months is clearly now in my eyes. It's up to you to make up your own mind based on the 4 elements I've just presented. Then you will be able to make the best decision for yourself.

I've been on the fence about refinancing for a year now ...Thing is I am not sure if the juice is worth the squeeze.

I've been trying to shop around and I am looking for some honest feedback here since I know the brokers will tell me to go for it. :)

&amp;#x200B;

My mortgage company provided me the following with regards to refinancing to a 15yr:

  

Loan Type: **Conventional**

Loan Term: **15 Year**

 Monthly Payment

Current: $2,160  New: **$2,623\***

Loan Term *(Years Remaing)*

Current: 28+  New: **15**

  Interest Rate *(Fixed)*

Current: 3.250%  New: **1.750%\*\***

  APR— **2.256%**

 Loan Amounts

Current:  $276,926  New: **$284,600**

Cash from Borrower: **$6,511**

&amp;#x200B;

Another lender sent me the following:

At a 283k loan amount on a 15 year term,  at 1.75 your P&amp;I would be 1788 and plus escrow your looking at 2676 monthly.  With good credit the best execution today is 1.75 yielding back .500 credit to you.     What I like the most about 15 year notes is that your monthly payments starting hitting your principle balance right away.    Your equity would increase substantially.   If your started with 283k,  in 2 years your balance would be 250k, 5 years 198k.      If your approx. 1.5 years into your current term,   in 5 more years your balance would be 250k.     About a 50k difference 

Could someone help me decide, please?

Thanks so much all",finance
personalfinance,First paycheck from new job has unexpectedly high taxes being taken out. Do I need to adjust withholdings on W-4?,"I've recently received my first paycheck from a new job that I've recently started and feel that something isn't right with the amount that I receive after taxes are taken out. Possibly relevant, this job pays a little over $20k year more than my previous job (\~69k vs 90k annual). At this new job, I get paid bi-weekly and this first full check was gross $3,461.54. After taxes, however, I receive $2,550.91!

Tax breakdown for this paycheck:

* Federal Income Tax is $491.82
* Social Security Tax: $214.62
* Medicare: $50.19
* MO State Income Tax: $154.00
* Total: $910.63 total in taxes

While the above numbers do add up, I can't help but think that maybe I need to adjust my withholdings on my W-4. However when I use the estimator tool on the IRS website, the results aren't the clearest.

[These](https://imgur.com/a/beOI7M0) screenshots of what the estimator is showing me how I can adjust my refund to tweak my withholdings.

The first picture shows the amount that I currently set to get back (this is with future 401k contributions included)

I think that I should just decrease the refund amount and less will be withheld from my pay. However when I slide it all they way left, thinking that this will give me the least withholdings, there looks like there will be MORE withheld.

In the last picture I moved it for a bigger return only to see that doing this yields a lower withholding amount??

I'm sure there's something that I'm not seeing. If anyone can help me to lower my withholdings, I would be extremely grateful!

I will be filing Single with no dependents.

Thanks

stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Friday, July 23, 2021","**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, July 23, 2021**

Stocks continued their remarkable rally today, wildy reversing after Monday’s decline to surge higher for the fourth consecutive day, with the three major indexes once again approaching record levels. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) both rose more than 1%, while the Dow Jones (DIA) traded 0.7% higher at the time of writing. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small caps, reversed from yesterday’s session to trade 0.4% higher at the time of writing, once again proving that market participants remain eager and able to buy up any dips. 

It seems market participants continue to weigh a variety of factors, including but not limited to: (1) faster-than-expected pace of economic recovery, (2) surging corporate earnings, (3) potential inflationary pressures, (4) labor market imbalances, and (5) concerns surrounding the coronavirus delta variant. Basically, the market is balancing between expectations for rapid economic expansion moving forward and concerns surrounding inflation and the delta variant.

Yesterday,  the Labor Department released the Weekly Unemployment report, which unfortunately, showed an unexpected rise in new jobless claims filed. New jobless claims jumped to 419,000, well above consensus estimates of 360,000 and a sharp jump from the previous week, which showed pandemic-era lows in claims filed. Since the beginning of the pandemic, market participants have closely tracked these numbers in order to gauge the health of the labor market. However, with rising infections threatening to trigger new restrictions, labor market reports have taken on more importance than usual.

Mark Hamrick, Senior Economic Analyst at Bankrate said, “With the recent resurgence in COVID cases stemming from the Delta variant, the jump in jobless claims is a disappointment. Recovery is never a perfect straight line.

While Monday may have preoccupied market participants, Q2 earning season continues and is shaping up to be another record-setting quarter, with most companies surging past earnings estimates. This week, we have seen Chipotle (CMG), Coca-Cola (KO), Verizon (VZ), Twitter (TWTR), Snap (SNAP), Southwest (LUV), among others beating earnings. So far, analysts are looking for S&amp;P 500 earnings to grow by 61.9% year-on-year in aggregate, according to FactSet data – an estimate UBS's Head of Equity Derivatives Research Stuart Kaiser said may still be ""need to be revised higher."" 

**Highlights**

* Chinese stocks fell as a whole today due to fears that the Chinese Communist Party will continue to penalize its tech companies. In the latest move, the CCP brought the hammer down on ride-hailing company Didi, with reports coming that the company will be hit with a massive fine of more than $2.8 billion, which would break the record paid by Alibaba (BABA) earlier this year, and threats that include suspending certain company operations and forcing the withdrawal of US-listed shares. Didi is down roughly 50% since its IPO on June 30.
* U.S. Composite PMI Output Index, which tracks the manufacturing and services sectors, fell to a four-month low of 59.7 from 63.7 in June. A reading above 50 indicates growth.
* Members of the US Federal Reserve are set to meet on Tuesday and Wednesday of this week in order to debate the timeline to taper quantitative easing and the potential risks around the resurging Delta variant
* Shares of Intel (INTC) gapped down despite smashing earnings estimates after reporting its outlook, which suggests the company will continue to lose market share to other competitors, mainly AMD and Nvidia (NVDA).
* Shares of Snap (SNAP) rocketed up after the company smashed earnings, with revenue more than doubling compared to last year and the company raising guidance moving forward. Twitter (TWTR) beat as well but not as dramatically.

personalfinance,Pay Off Which Debts First?,"Hey Y'all,

I've posted on here before but I couldn't find my posts. Here's my situation. I made a lot of bad choices pre-25 years old, and didn't learn my lesson until I was 28. Here's a list of my debts.

Truck Loan: $15,800 (8.990%) ($379.10 / month, 3 of 6 year loan / No Refinance)

Sutdent Loans: \~$18,700 (0.00% - Forbearance) (Was $186)

Personal Loan: $8,700 (17.52%) ($252)

Credit Card: \~$6,000 (Varies - 11% - 36%)(11 - 13% - $2500)

(23.99% - $1750) (Varies $50 - $75)

(0.00% - $800) (As long as I pay it off in the first year, this has no interest on it. I miss 1 payment, and it all comes back due 1 in payment) ($35)

(? - $100) Les Schwab Account / Interest Unknown(36% - $30) (Varies on balance ($25))

Collections: \~$1,750

Income: $57,780 (\~$65,000 when I work OT most of the year)

&amp;#x200B;

What I've been doing is paying off my lowest CC, and when it's paid off, using that payment to my next lowest + the minimum. Instead of $50, it'd be $80 or $100. It was going pretty good until my truck broke down. :( On that same note, my truck is breaking again, and I'm looking at $5,000 to get it fixed. I don't have that cash on hand. I need a new truck, the one I have now is a lemon, and I've spent almost twice what I spent on it in the first place ($25k).

Edit: The highest interest rate card I have \~$25 left to pay off. Unfortunately, autopay failed, and they didn't notify me until a week afterwards that I didn't pay. Not sure how that'll affect credit now.I'll wait to see responses after updating Loan Interest Rates. Before you ask, yes I want that 36% IR card gone. They started charging monthly fees of $8.50. Even if I use it, or if I don't. It's a total joke/scam.",finance

CryptoCurrency,Massively inconvenient Banking surprise today.,"WORD OF WARNING DO NOT USE STATE EMPLOYEE CREDIT UNION IF YOU WANT TO PURCHASE CRYPTOCURRENCY!!!

I have been Banking at State Employees Credit Union (North Carolina) For years. I started making regular purchases of CryptoCurrency back in February 2021 (This year I know) Well today when I woke up I went to make my normal $50 purchase and [Crypto.com](https://Crypto.com) said there was an error (No real context to the error.) It turns out that because there have been some fraudulent purchases of crypto currency State Employee's Credit Union (North Carolina) now is blocking all crypto purchases from happening. 

Their ""Customer Service"" Represenative's suggestion for a solution and I quote ""Get a Prepaid card"" Yea so now I have to spend the $1 to buy the card and looking at the cards I now get to accrue a $5.94 monthly fee to keep the card active. Not to mention the additional time to transfer funds to the card and then make the purchase. Either that or go to another bank with a lower interest rate and move all my direct deposits as well as all of my automatic payments to the new accounts.

How is this even something they can legally do in the United States? Just up and tell you where you can and cannot spend your money.

personalfinance,Should we pay off mortgage or invest??,"Recently me and my significant other bought a duplex with her mother.  We took out a mortgage for the whole house (a little over 500k) and got a good interest rate since we used her mother's money to pay for the full down-payment.  Now that she is moving in, she plans to pay out her half of the house and we will continue to pay for our portion through the mortgage.

My question is: should we rebalance our mortgage with the full amount of the money, or find what is the maximum we can pay for a mortgage within our means, lower our payment to that amount, and invest the rest?  

Her mother is a part of this conversation so there is not anything shady going on.  My thought process is that our interest rate is right around 2.4%, which should easily be beat by the market  Additionally, we would have a nice backup of easily accessible money for projects or things that may come up.  We plan to reach out to a qualified financial advisor, but wanted to see what insight others might have.

*****
&gt; Here comes one of the biggest market weeks of the summer.
*****
&gt; First, the Federal Reserve meets Tuesday and Wednesday. While no action is expected, there could be some mention of the central bank’s possible wind down of its bond program. That could move the markets since the tapering of the central bank’s bond purchases is seen as the first step on the way to interest rate hikes.
*****
&gt; Then there are about 165 S&amp;P 500 companies releasing earnings reports, including the biggest tech names— Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet and Facebook. Tesla is reporting, as are industrial heavy weights Boeing and Caterpillar. There are slew of consumer names, including Procter &amp; Gamble and McDonald’s.
*****
&gt; There is also important economic news. The second quarter is expected to be the peak period for post-pandemic growth, and gross domestic product for the quarter will be released Thursday. On Friday, the Fed’s favorite inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditure inflation index, is released.
*****
&gt; # Fresh highs for major indexes
&gt; The three major U.S. stock indexes enter the busy week with fresh closing records. The Dow closed above 35,000 for the first time on Friday. The S&amp;P 500 gained 1% to close at 4,411.79, and the Nasdaq Composite ended the day up 1%.
*****
&gt; “I think earnings are going to be the show, and if the pattern we’ve seen thus far continues next week, and it’s likely it will, that’s going to find a market that has a path of least resistance to the upside and I think that’s good news,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities.
*****
&gt; According to Refinitiv, earnings for the second quarter are looking to be up 78.1%.
*****
&gt; “It’s going to be crazy,” said Hogan. “I think the order of magnitude of earnings beats is still underappreciated, and I think that will continue next week: 87% of companies are beating estimates.”
*****
&gt; Hogan said early in earnings season, stocks of companies that beat expectations did not react, but now they are and that should continue. The fact a handful of the biggest market cap stocks — like Apple, Microsoft and Alphabet — are reporting so close to each other could have an impact.
*****
&gt; “This is like the World Series of earnings smack in the middle of summer,” he said.
*****
&gt; # Stocks rebound
&gt; Investors will also be watching the behavior of markets themselves. Stocks ended the week with solid gains, but the bruising sell-off Monday has left its mark. Some strategists say it could have been a warning sign for more turbulence later in the quarter.
*****
&gt; Stocks took their cue from the 10-year Treasury yield, which was falling Monday on fears the delta variant of Covid could slow global growth. The yield hit a low of 1.12% early Tuesday before reversing. As the benchmark yield rose, stocks rallied.
*****
&gt; For now, stocks seem to be set for more gains. The Dow closed the past week at 35,061.55, up about 1%. The S&amp;P 500 gained 1.9% for the week, ending at 4,411.79. The Nasdaq climbed 2.8% week-to-date, and the small-cap Russell 2000 rose 2.1%.
*****
&gt; Communications services, which includes internet names, was the best performing sector in the past week with a 3.2% gain. Tech was also strong, up 2.8%. Consumer discretionary was also a top sector, up 2.9%. Cyclical industrials and material lagged with fractional gains, and energy was slightly lower.
*****
&gt; Scott Redler, chief strategic officer with T3Live.com, said the Big Tech names like Apple and Microsoft are already doing well ahead of earnings, so it will be important to see how they trade.
*****
&gt; “Some things are priced for perfection and some aren’t,” he said. “Microsoft is already at an all-time high. It’s priced for perfection. It will be interesting to see if Apple can hold and stay above $150.” Apple closed at $148.56 per share Friday.
*****
&gt; # Fed ‘taper talk’
&gt; Ben Jeffery, U.S. rates strategist at BMO, said Treasury yields could find a catalyst in the Fed. He expects the 10-year to begin moving down again, and says it could possibly touch a low of 1.10%. The 10-year was at 1.28% Friday afternoon.
*****
&gt; Strategists do not expect to see much new in the Federal Reserve’s statement. They await comments from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell for guidance on the central bank’s move toward tapering back its quantitative easing program.
*****
&gt; The Fed is expected to announce that it is officially talking about winding down the program well before it actually starts. Many Fed watchers believe that guidance will come in late August, at the central bank’s Jackson Hole symposium, or later in the fall.
*****
&gt; “I think it will be interesting to see how dovish Powell tries to be with the delta variant risk and concerns about that,” said Jeffery.
*****
&gt; Luke Tilley, chief economist at Wilmington Trust, does not expect much new from Powell this week. “I’m really targeting Jackson Hole as the most likely candidate for a pivot point for policy and communication,” he said. “However, next week’s meeting could set the stage for that with some statements that point us toward some improvement in the economy. They’ll be highlighting the new risks of the delta variant, and that’s the risk we think they point out.”
*****
&gt; Slowing the bond program is important since it is a signal that the Fed is on the road to reversing its easy policies, including ultimately its zero policy rate. Tilley said the central bank will probably take a year to wind down its $120 billion a month in bond purchases, and then the door is open to rate hikes.
*****
&gt; Investors will also be watching second quarter GDP to see how much strength there is in the economy.
*****
&gt; According to CNBC/Moody’s Analytics rapid update, a survey of economists expects second quarter growth to grow by an average 9.7%. It is expected to be the peak period for growth, and the average forecast for third quarter growth is 8.3%.
*****
&gt; Tilley said he expects growth for the 2021 year of 7% to 7.5%.

&gt; # August has been a dangerous month for the market

&gt; August is the worst DJIA, S&amp;P 500, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 month over the last 33 years, 1988-2020 with average declines ranging from 0.4% by Russell 2000 to 0.8% by DJIA. For NASDAQ August ranks second worst over the same period with an average gain of 0.2%.

&gt; Contributing to this poor performance since 1987; the second shortest bear market in history (45 days) caused by turmoil in Russia, the Asian currency crisis and the Long-Term Capital Management hedge fund debacle ending August 31, 1998 with the DJIA shedding 6.4% that day. DJIA dropped a record 1344.22 points for the month, off 15.1%—which is the second worst monthly percentage DJIA loss since 1950. Saddam Hussein triggered a 10.0% slide in August 1990. Sizeable losses in 2010, 2011, 2013 and 2015 of over 4% on DJIA have widened Augusts’ average decline.

&gt; In post-election years, Augusts’ rankings are little changed. August is the worst month for DJIA and Russell 1000 and second worst for S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ and Russell 2000. Average declines in post-election year Augusts swell to 0.8% by Russell 2000 to 1.7% by DJIA. Each index has also seen more declining post-election year Augusts than positive.

&gt; # Bulls and Bears Dead Even

&gt; For the third week in a row, bullish sentiment has slid with this week's reading from the AAII falling to 30.6%. With a cumulative 18-percentage point decline in that time, bullish sentiment is now at the lowest level since October 1st, 2020.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/07/072221-AAII-Bull.png))**

&gt; An identical share of respondents to the survey reported as bearish this week. That is only the 47th time in the survey's history that an equal share reported as bullish and bearish with the most recent other occurrence being the end of October 2020. Now back above 30%, bearish sentiment is at the highest level since the first week of February which is also essentially right in line with the historical average for bearish sentiment (30.53%).

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/07/072221-AAII-Bear.png))**

&gt; Identical readings in bullish and bearish sentiment means the spread between the two is at zero. As shown below, that is the first non-positive reading in the spread since the last week of January.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/07/072221-AAII-BB-Spread.png))**

&gt; As previously mentioned, throughout the history of the AAII's survey going back to the late 1980s, there have only been 47 instances of identical readings in bullish and bearish sentiment, or when the bull-bear spread equals zero, including the most recent instance. In the chart below we show the average performance of the S&amp;P 500 over the next weeks and months following those instances. As shown, across the board the S&amp;P 500 has tended to underperform the norm with the one-week and one-month periods averaging a decline. Again, while the gains are smaller than normal, the S&amp;P 500 has at least been higher 71.7% of the time six months out and 84.4% of the time one year later.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/07/072221-AAII-Perf.png))**

&gt; Not all of the losses to bullish sentiment turned bearish. Neutral sentiment rose 1.7 percentage points for a second week in a row. At 38.7%, neutral sentiment is at the highest level since June 10th.

&gt; # Is It Time For A 5% Pullback?

&gt; Monday’s big down day was a harsh reminder of how markets actually can produce volatility. It was the worst day of the year for the Dow and only the second drop of 1% or more for the S&amp;P 500 Index in just over two months.

&gt; As we noted recently in Three Things That Worry Us, there are many reasons to think that after more than a 90% rally (and virtually a double on a total return basis), the S&amp;P 500 could finally be ready for a break. From less stocks participating, to weak seasonality, to a lack of bears, to typical choppiness during year two of a bull market, the summer months could be ripe for an eventual pullback (down 5-9%) or even a 10% correction.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/7.21.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; “The truth is investors have been very spoiled by the recent stock market performance,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Incredibly, we haven’t seen as much as a 5% pullback since October. Although we firmly think this bull market is alive and well, let’s not fool ourselves into thinking trees grow forever. Risk is no doubt increasing as we head into the troublesome August and September months.”

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the average year sees three separate 5% or more pullbacks for the S&amp;P 500 with not a single one happening yet in 2021. This doesn’t mean a 5% correction is directly around the corner, but note that most stocks are actually already down as much as 10% off their recent highs, suggesting the internals of the market are a tad weak and risk is higher than normal.

&gt; Looking at 10% corrections, the S&amp;P 500 has averaged exactly one a year since 1950. Of course, with the historic volatility last year we saw four separate 10% corrections, though there hasn’t been a 10% correction since March 2020. Again, this could be getting long in the tooth after the 90% plus rally from the lows.

&gt; Overall, worries over inflation, yields, the Delta COVID-19 variant, peaking economic data, or something else will get the headlines for any market weakness. We know that year two of bull markets can be choppy and frustrating, but the truth is earnings remain extremely strong, justifying stocks at current levels. It is just that sometimes stocks need to catch their breath, and we wouldn’t be surprised at all if that happened over the coming months.

&gt; # The Recession Is Over, So What Happens Next?

&gt; The National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) announced yesterday that the COVID-19 recession is over. If things don’t feel all that different, it’s because they announced the recession ended in April 2020. Yes, that’s last year. We are now in the 15th month of the new expansion. This delay is perfectly normal. NBER doesn’t change a recession call once it’s made, so they need to have a high degree of confidence in the supporting data. Waiting until 15 months after the recession is over is actually the average since they started making recession calls in real time in the 1970s.

&gt; “Stock markets gave us an early signal on the end of the recession back in March 2020,” said LPL Research Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “The S&amp;P 500 tends to bottom before a recession ends and it did this time as well, despite the narrow window of the shortest recession ever. It just took a while for the economic data to catch up.”

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the recession lasted only two months, the shortest on record, but also one of the steepest, the economy contracting more in just two months than any other recession back to 1948.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/7.20.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; So what happens now?

&gt; Based on history, we are likely in for several more years of economic expansion. Expansions are on no particular timetable but the average length of an expansion does tell us something about how long it usually takes for the kind of economic excesses to build up that usually cause recessions. While post-World War II expansions have lasted as little as 12 months, the average is more than five years and the last four expansions have averaged over eight years.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/7.20.21-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Absent an unexpected shock, we would not be on the lookout for a recession until the Federal Reserve (Fed) raises its policy rate several times. Recessions are usually accompanied by an inverted yield curve, where short-term interests are higher than long-term rates, not the normal situation. Since the Fed has a lot of influence over short-term interest rates, they often play some role in the yield curve inverting. The Fed usually won’t start to raise rates until the economy starts to strengthen and will continue to raise rates as it heats up. Raising rates several times is a signal that excesses have started to build that make the economy more vulnerable to a recession. Raising rates also adds to that vulnerability by pushing up short-term borrowing costs.

&gt; While rate hike expectations have come forward, they still put a recession several years away. In the Fed policy committee’s latest economic projections, the consensus view was for no rate hikes in 2021 or 2022, and two rate hikes in 2023. While those projections will change based on what’s actually happening in the economy, if it held true it likely would not be enough to signal increased danger of a recession.

&gt; But just because we don’t see a recession on the horizon does not mean it’s an all clear for markets. As discussed in our Midyear Outlook 2021: Picking Up Speed, we do still view the overall economic backdrop as supportive. But we are also in the second year of a bull market, which tends to be choppier than the first year, although the S&amp;P 500 Index does typically still see gains.

&gt; NBER’s announcement is something to celebrate, but it does not signal smooth sailing ahead. Still, most bear markets are associated with recessions, and with plenty of fiscal stimulus still in play, the Fed’s policy rate still near zero, and the labor market continuing to see strong improvement, even if slower than expected, absent a shock we are not expecting a recession any time soon, and that’s usually good news for markets.

personalfinance,Keep ESOP Payout in 401k or Pay Off All My Debt?,"My company, which until recently was an Employee Owned Stock Program, sold to an investment group. Per the terms of the buyout, our individual amounts of stock would be sold and we would be payed out through our 401k. As part of all of this, we are allowed to take a fee, and to my knowledge, tax free??? distribution of up to 50% of the ESOP deposit. This is a one time only option and I have a deadline of September 18th to request a distribution. 

So, do I leave the money (59.4k) in the 401K ($138.7k including the ESOP sum ) and just have a boost to my 401k? This is equivalent to maxing contribution for three years. For context, I started maxing out my 401k and IRA contributions this year. 

OR 

Do I take out that 50% (29.6k) and a little out of my savings and pay off all my outstanding debt? I have about 27k in Federal student loans at whatever percent they will be after forbearance ends. Then I have about 6k in 0% promo purchases with monthly minimums. (Furniture, mower, lasik)

Bitcoin,Bitcoin made a better person!!!!,"&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for the long post but hear me out..I made plenty of mistakes initially when I came into crypto space. Went after alts and shitcoins and should have ended up with more Bitcoins than what I have right now. All of this happend cos I didn't 'DYOR' and had very little clue about the space. Once I went in the Bitcoin rabbit hole..I have learned so much that now I am a different person and feel better about myself.

Things I learned - 

1.) I understand finance and money much better now

2.) I used to be quite pro govt and used to trust the authority. I now understand how these guys use fiat money to fund war and use the central banking system to benefit themselves

3.) You guys might remember that in 2016 Govt of India made 500 and 1000 rupee bills illegal tender in name of curbing black money and stopping money laundering and replaced it with new currencies. All of this was annouced overnight and from next day the 500 and 1000 rps bills that people held had no value. I was stupid enough to support this and trust the Govt in this move.

After going down the Bitcoin rabbit hole I realised that how wrong and dangerous this move from the Govt was and how stupid I was to trust them. Many poor and middle class people suffered due to this move. Rich weren't even affected cos they had power and contacts they find loopholes.

4.) After this I realised the importance of Bitcoin. I understood what decentralization means and why it is important. Words like censorship resistance and be your own bank started making sense.

5.) I won't lie - I have cheered the powerful countries invading the less powerful in name of ""Fight against Terrorism"" and ""ending dictatorship"" cos I belived they were right. I realized how these invasion were made possible due to central banking policies and printing money. I don't do that anymore and understand the struggles of the less priviliged nations.

6.)  I am not saying that with Bitcoin Standard there will be no wars. Humans are shit and will kill each other regardless but funding wars won't be that easy with Bitcoin Standard. Number of wars will go down significantly.

7.) I was foolish to think that poor people stay poor cos they don't work hard, they  are lazy and stupid and blah blah blah. After going down the rabbit hole I learned how inflation is eating away the little savings that these people manage despite working hard and living on bare minimum expenses. I realized due to lack of credit history they never get loans to help educate themselves or their kids or start a business. If they borrow money from some unregulated borrower then they get ripped off due to insane interest rates and frauds. Its like being stuck in a endless loop of poverty with no way out. I no longer look down upon poor people and feel empathic towards them. I feel I am a better person now and all this happend cos I went in the Bitcoin rabbit hole.

If anyone of you haven't read enough on Bitcoin then pls pls go for it. Read 'The Bitcoin Standard', 'The Bullish Case for Bitcoin' and watch all those documentaries. This will be your best investment.

personalfinance,Help with debt vs retirement,"I go back and forth on the best approach to addressing some student loan debt while also continuing to save for retirement. Up until 2 years ago my wife was qualified for PSLF but that is no longer the case. 5 years of paying a \~$50 a month caused the balance to grow a few thousand dollars a year. The interest rate is 6.55%. Since paying the loan off became a reality we quickly started looking at refinancing and then COVID happened and 0% interest has been awesome. Since that is coming to an end its time to figure out what to do.

My wife and I are 32 and 36 respectively.

 Debt:  
Student Loan A – 14k @ 4.375 (currently 0% but will be 7%)  
Student Loan B – 141k @ 6.85 (currently 0% and will be refinancing @ \~3%)  
Mortgage – 92k @ 4.125% 

Emergency fund: 4 months of expenses as is (more like 6-8 months if it was a real emergency).

Investments:

My 401k: $68k   
My Roth 401k: $21k

Her 401k: $55k  
Her Roth IRA: $11k

Its looking like the 0% student loan interest is expiring in September so we want to refinance around that time. We were quoted 3.54% for 15 years 3.2% for 10 years, 3.08% for 7 and 3.02% for 5. The 10 years @ 3.2% seems to make the most sense. We'd like it gone in 5 years but the flexibility of having a lower monthly payment is nice.

The real question I have is regarding the \~$30k have on hand right now. We plan to pay off the 14k loan but I'm wondering if it makes more sense to invest the remainder instead of pay down the other loan as much as possible before refinancing. 3.2% interest is low and it seems likely the returns would beat that. Thoughts?

To make things a little more complicated I am in the middle of contemplating a career change which may drastically reduce our income for a couple of years. Should I keep this money more liquid as an excess emergency fund if this were the case. 

Let me know if there are other details that sharing would help.",finance
personalfinance,"Im going to graduate with like 50k in debt, and I only now realize how much I overpaid for a degree (IT) how should I go about paying that off?","**Hey, so here's the scoop**, I'm sure this is a very common thing; I'm soon to graduate, in a year hopefully, with an IT degree and some software engineering skills (very light, but something I have learned and hope to learn competently enough to get a job in).

I'm the first person in my family to go to college, and I didn't have anyone who was really advising me correctly before I made the decisions I've made. 

I was just told ad infinitum to go to college by everyone around me, with no real practical guidance besides that.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, I now realize how much I have grossly overpaid for my degree. 

&amp;#x200B;

**My main question is:**

**What sort of payment plan should I go about when I start paying?**

I'm not sure I'll be able to get a really great-paying job without moving, and I don't honestly feel super confident in my programming/SWE skills. So I may have to first take work in a ""lower-end"" IT-type job or an unrelated field while I grind coding challenges.

&amp;#x200B;

If I do manage to make good money at some point, would it be better to be more aggressive with paying off the loans? Should this be something at the top of my priority list until it's dealt with?

&amp;#x200B;

They're all federal loans, no private.

Or do most people literally just take a low payment and accept that unless they do very well career-wise they're saddled with a monthly payment into perpetuity?

CryptoCurrency,Do Your Own Research Checklist,"Here are things that I generally look at when interested in purchasing a coin. 

**Does the coin have a use?** I don’t invest in coins without a use

**Is the coin being used for its use?** There are many coins that have a use that aren’t used. I think a coin that is actually used will be more likely to stay around.

**What chain is the coin on?** I like more respectable chains for long term hold.

**Are there other coins with the same symbol?** This is more common on some exchanges than others.

**Does the coin have liquidity?** Use a site like bogged.finance to check for liquidity, there are other good sites depending on the chain. The amount of liquidity I want depends on the chain and how new the coin is.

**Do the staking returns and ‘promos’ make sense?** I don’t like exchange promos. I don’t like insane interest rates. I look at the marketing budget if these things are high and try to see how many extra coins will be distributed and when it will run out at the current rate.

**What percentage of the coins are distributed?** If there is a low percentage of coins distributed this is a red flag (not 100% a scam, but higher chance). If I cannot find this on my first resource, I search until I find it.

**What are the max number of coins?** (I then calculate what the market cap would be at $0.01/$0.10/$1.00 and see if that is a reasonable market cap for the coin).

**Are the founders and team doxxed?** (Are they really doxxed and do I think that the team members makes sense. If they list 1-3 social media people and they have a minimal social media presence this is a red flag.)

**Social Media** How good is the social media? How many sources are they on? Is it pump and dump style (bad) or more established company style? Do they focus on gaining money with their coin (bad) or the actual product?

**Crypto Events Calendar** I try to see if the coin is on an event calendar like CoinsCalendar or CoinMarketCal. This is more overall information, but some red flags can be found.

**Company Legal Structure** This is a little more detailed, but I want to make sure that the crypto is not an abroad shell company. I want to make sure that they have formed a company and it is registered.

**Smart Contract Code** I check the code with code checking websites. I want to make sure it is not a copy paste.

**White Paper** I read the white paper, the whole damn thing. So many white papers think that you will skip the middle and the junk they include is amazing.

**Token Distribution** I want to make sure that the token distribution is clear and described well.

**How many coins do the founders and whales have?** I prefer a more even distribution of coins.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Looking to buy land and build small houses for family. I have no idea what I'm doing.,"I'm not sure if this is the right place to post, apologies if not! Several members of my extended family are planning to come together with me to buy a large plot of land and build six individual homes on it. Basically a family commune but without the farming or cult stuff :P I've been doing a lot of research but I'm floundering, so I was hoping y'all could help me out, or at least point me in the right direction! I know I'll need to speak to various professionals about these issues for specific answers, but I'm not sure which exactly for several of them.     

- How does a mortgage work when doing new construction? I know a standard loan would have a much higher interest rate than a mortgage so we need to avoid that. Would the purchase of a trailer home or modular home work in the same way as a new construction?     

- Strictly from a financial perspective, would it be better to have everyone on the mortgage, or just the person/people with the best credit? Would this change if we were to get something like a HomeReady or FHA loan?     

- We're thinking of doing a 30 year loan, but paying it off in 15-20. This way the required monthly payment is cheaper so if we are strapped for cash, that's a way to save a bit, but we'll still avoid paying all the extra money that an additional 10-15yrs would entail. Is that how that would work, or am I totally off-base?     

- Roughly how much should I expect to spend on hooking each house up to the utilities if they are already accessible at the property? What if they're not? Will splitting the lines up cause issues?     

- I custom designed a home for myself, but am of course not an architect. How would I go about consulting someone to make sure it's all good and up to code? How much might I expect that to cost?     

- What additional costs or pitfalls should I be aware of?

16. President of Tanzania calls on the central bank to prepare for the adoption of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. I wonder what crypto ecosystem already has experience working with an African government on a big crypto project and has partnered with a mobile company that is already bringing connectivity to rural Tanzania?

17. With exploits like this one being all too common in the legacy smart contract networks, we’re not even going to have sell the Cardano use case for DeFi. The competitor networks have already made the case that something better must be on the way.

20. While renewable energy is certainly a wonderful thing, there may be a problem with your technology when your path to compete on clean energy consumption involves you talking about harnessing the power of a whole series of volcanoes. Maybe just use fewer volcano’s and more proof-of-stake? [https://twitter.com/\_eLaPs\_/status/1404125569093029889](https://twitter.com/_eLaPs_/status/1404125569093029889) [https://twitter.com/gladstein/status/1402718041557725184](https://twitter.com/gladstein/status/1402718041557725184)

22. The bank of England is getting very serious about how it “may wish to limit migration” of money from the legacy system to stablecoins. Wow. Just another example of why it’s such an asset (no pun intended) that Cardano is prepared for regulation. [https://twitter.com/CaitlinLong\_/status/1405712468823842816](https://twitter.com/CaitlinLong_/status/1405712468823842816)

25. It’s a good sign that the top two crypto communities are spending so much time talking negatively about Cardano. You only focus your hatred on that which is most threatening. I’m glad to see we’re the biggest threat on their radar. [https://twitter.com/nic\_\_carter/status/1405194146063736840](https://twitter.com/nic__carter/status/1405194146063736840)

28. It looks like the second biggest ETH stakepool or it's custody provider has lost it’s users private keys to $75MM in ETH. Cardano doesn’t have this problem. We get to keep custody of our crypto because we found a better way than slashing. [https://stakehound.com/blog-post/fireblocks-eth-2-key-management-incident/](https://stakehound.com/blog-post/fireblocks-eth-2-key-management-incident/) [https://twitter.com/JamesSpediacci/status/1407465311180255236](https://twitter.com/JamesSpediacci/status/1407465311180255236)

31. The June Cardano 360 is currently available on Youtube. [https://youtu.be/al5m14299ww](https://youtu.be/al5m14299ww)
32. We saw segments on various newer partner entities like Nervos, Orion Protocol, and Revuto. Nervos is a UTXO proof-of-work blockchain which is building a cross-chain bridge with Cardano so that you can use your ADA on Nervos dApps and vice versa. Interoperability is a big theme for Nervos and they plan to have a working testnet within a month. Orion Protocol is building a terminal that will allow for decentralized non-custodial trading across centralized and decentralized exchanges. They say this would not require you to KYC or even have an account with any of these exchanges. Revuto is an online subscription management service that recently completed a $10MM token sale on Cardano.
33. It was also revealed that Wolfram Labs, COTI, and IOHK have a three-way partnership (a ménage à tech) to build an NFT auction site. The people from Wolfram were talking about very interesting things including live minting during streaming events and automated upload to IPFS. COTI will be building out auction and bidding mechanisms in ADAPay.
34. Professor Aggelos Kiayias gave us an update on research including that Ouroboros Chronos and Hydra papers have both been accepted into conferences/journals. Chronos will provide Cardano with a global concept of time that doesn’t rely on any outside timekeeper. Prof. Kiayias also pointed out that Hydra is distinguishable from other layer two protocols in that the scripting language is identical to that of the base layer in Cardano such that any dApp that can run on Cardano will run on the Hydra L2. This is a huge plus and superior to many other layer two solutions in other ecosystems where the base layer dApps will not run on layer two. Finally, the Mithril paper has been submitted for peer review. It will provide Cardano light wallets with Succinct Non-interactive Arguments of Knowledge that will give us the best of both worlds: no delays for syncing as in full node wallets while still preserving trustlessness.
35. Finally, the Goguen Summit will be in late September. Sign up now at [summit.cardano.org](http://summit.cardano.org/).
36. The Fed is once again STRONGLY signalling to us that they are going to regulate stablecoins. The Fed is also specifically calling out Tether for the first time. You need to be thinking about how stablecoin regulation might affect your favorite Cardano DeFi or other project. [https://twitter.com/CaitlinLong\_/status/1408500265397985282](https://twitter.com/CaitlinLong_/status/1408500265397985282) [https://twitter.com/CaitlinLong\_/status/1408572624125534212](https://twitter.com/CaitlinLong_/status/1408572624125534212)
37. People are starting to realize that the Stakehound private key loss in ETH may attract unwanted regulatory attention to Ethereum 2.0 while this problem could never have occurred in Cardano. Also, only a few days later another ETH stakepool (this time SharedStake...the sixth biggest ETH Stakepool) allegedly experiences a rugpull that some are valuing at over $30MM. This is another problem that could not happen in Cardano staking. It feels like we stepped into the ring, they rang the bell, and ETH just started punching itself in the head. Eventually it’s going to KO itself.

39. John O’Connor of IOHK points out that France still controls the monetary policy of 14 countries in Africa. There is definitely a built in market on the continent for a project that delivers monetary sovereignty to the people.

52. Robert Kornacki of dcSpark releases an article on why every Cardano dApp will use NFTs. The article contains some very interesting discussion on smart contracts in the EUTXO context including language instructing that “UTXOs have smart contracts attached to them and not the other way around” and “\[...\]the simplest way to think about it is that when a UTXO is created it has the option to have a smart contract attached to it.” [https://medium.com/dcspark/every-eutxo-dapp-will-use-nfts-and-heres-why-fd87e6a8c9a6](https://medium.com/dcspark/every-eutxo-dapp-will-use-nfts-and-heres-why-fd87e6a8c9a6)

71. Very interesting timing with a) Grayscale Buying $50MM ETCG, b) Grayscale adding ADA, and c) Charles joining the ETC Cooperative board given that two of the members of the ETC Cooperative board seem to come from Grayscale and DCG.

98. Notable news for upcoming Cardano DeFi projects. There may be slightly less competition in the “get a return on your crypto assets” game very soon. The New Jersey AG’s office has delivered a cease and desist letter to BlockFi. The AG’s press release cited BlockFi’s interest bearing deposit accounts as unregistered securities and also mentioned the lack of FDIC or SPIC insurance for it’s depositors. This leaves some lingering questions for Cardano DeFi projects that might be planning to accept deposits or other transfers of value and offering a return of sorts. You could argue that these projects are decentralized where BlockFi was not. But, the AG’s press release seems to cite decentralization as one of the risks of DeFi projects. Also, as a practical matter, there is a question whether decentralization will be a good shield from regulators since many of these projects have companies and real humans with faces and names behind them unlike a truly anonymous founder such as Satoshi Nakamoto.

**Summary (by me)**: Abkhazia banned cryptomining due to putting more demand on their power grid than that they could handle. However, they realized that it was not something that can truly be banned so now they are in talks with the Russian Federation to ensure that they have a reliable cross-country power grid that can handle the demand, as well as providing clear conditions (buildings) for the mining operations.

**Personal opinion:** I am fascinated that the crypto industry is pushing more countries to hook up their power networks. However, I hope that this will also create demand for more sustainable energy and that it won't just lead to a ton of extra coal power plants but for that we will have to wait and see.",cryptocurrency

CryptoCurrency,The difference between APR and APY,"A lot of people here are staking their crypto, so I assume most of you have encountered these terms before, but a lot of people don't really understand the difference between the two. As such I thought I would explain the difference as simply as possible.


**APR = Annual Percentage Rate**


This is the amount you can approximately expect the initial amount of money to get in interest over one year. For example, if you staked $1000 worth of ETH and got an APR of 6%, you would expect to have about $1,060 by the end of the year:

$1000 x (1.06) = $1060 

However, this is assuming that you only get one payment at the end of the year of $60 for a year's worth of interest, and we all know that by staking crypto, you get payments more often than that. Some get interest payments every week, or even every day. Now let's assume you receive interest payments daily. The amount of interest you get every day is the APR divided by 365, since there are 365 days in a year. So your daily interest rate is:

6%/365 days = 0.01643836% every day in interest

So after one day, you will have:

$1000 x (1 + 0.06/365) = $1,000.16438

Now, on the second day, it will give you the same 0.01643836% in daily interest, but it won't use the $1000 you put in initially, it will give you interest based on how much you currently have staked, which is now $1,000.16438 after one day. So after you get your interest payment on the second day, you will have:

$1,000.16438 x (1 + 0.06/365) = $1,000.32879

It will then use the number you have after two days to calculate the interest you will receive for the third day. Notice how every day, the amount of money you have is increasing, and as a result the amount of money you receive in interest increases every day. This is called *compound interest*, and that's where APY comes in. 


**APY = Annual Percentage Yield**


This is the amount of interest you receive in a year taking into account compound interest. In other words, this is the how much interest you will receive taking into account you will be getting payments throughout the year. So if you have an APR like we said of 6%, and you receive interest payments daily, your APY is calculated as such:

APY = (1 + 0.06/365)^365 - 1 = 6.18313106779%

So in one year, you're actually getting 6.18313106779% in interest, not just the 6% that the APR said you were getting. So after one year you would have:

$1000 x (1.0618313106779) = $1,061.83


**To Sum Up**


Amount you will have after one year according to APR: 

$1060

Amount you will have after one year according to APY: 

$1,061.83

As you can see the numbers are not the same. APY just gives you a more accurate indicator as to how much you can expect to receive in interest by the end of the year. 


**So which is better: 6% APR or 6% APY?**


If you noticed, the percentage I calculated in APY is higher than the percent APR said you would be getting:

6% APR = 6.18313106779% APY (with daily payments)

So,  if you have the option to choose between 6% APR and 6% APY with the same frequency of payments in a year (in this case daily payments),  always choose 6% APR, since that comes out to be higher than 6% APY. 

Sorry for the length of this post, but I hope it helps some people.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Edit: A couple people seem confused about the last sentence, where I say 6% APR is better than 6% APY. This is because once you convert the 6% APR to APY by taking into account compound interest, that 6% APR **is equivalent to** 6.18313106779% APY (with daily payments). So by choosing 6% APR, you are actually receiving the equivalent of 6.18313106779% APY at the end of the year, which is more than 6% APY. In other words:

6% APR = 6.18313106779% APY &gt; 6% APY

Hope that clears things up.",cryptocurrency
CryptoCurrency,The Future: Digital Cash vs Crytpo,"Everyone knows the future of payments is digital. This can come in a number of different forms.

CryptoCurrency,Analysis of DEX Inflation Via Yield Farming Vs. Token Price,"Inflation is not only an important variable in monetary policy in the economy, but also important in crypto. Inflation is the easiest way to fund development. This forces holders to indirectly pay for development through the loss of value or ownership of the token over time to the protocol.

Inflation is usually referred to via a token release schedule; the researcher actively recalculates it.

# What Is Inflation?

&gt;Inflation in traditional economics refers to the **increase in prices of goods.** Inflation in token economics refers to the **increase in token supply.**

Inflation is the persistent increase in the general price level of goods and services over time and the value loss of a currency. When the general price level rises, **a unit of currency buys fewer goods and services than in the past.** Thus, inflation reflects a decrease in purchasing power per unit of a currency. In the economy, inflation is affected by many factors such as **demand-pull, cost-push, structural changes and import and export, etc.**

In the crypto space, inflation is the issuing of new crypto/tokens into circulation which puts selling pressure on them. In theory, their value should decrease with an increase in supply, if demand is constant. Inflation in the crypto space is mainly affected by **the increase in the supply of circulating tokens**.

# Token Issuance Model

The only impact on inflation is the issuance of tokens into circulation. Token inflation is used to bootstrap growth or to start a community. In this section we are going to find the answer to this question: which issuance models have been used so far in crypto space?

CryptoCurrency,Global Regulations of Cryptocurrencies 2021 - Part 1 North and South America and Europe,"##NORTH AMERICA

###United States
Cryptocurrencies are not considered as a legal tender, but exchanges are legal and the rules for the same vary from state to state. Cryptocurrencies are treated as property for U.S. federal tax purposes. The SEC in 2018, mentioned that the board considers cryptocurrencies to be securities and will apply securities laws comprehensively for digital wallets and exchanges.

The regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies is evolving despite overlap and differences in viewpoints between agencies. Although the SEC is widely seen as the most powerful regulator, Treasury’s FinCEN, the Federal Reserve Board, and the CFTC have issued their own differing interpretations and guidance. The SEC often views cryptos as securities, the CFTC calls bitcoin a commodity, and Treasury calls it a currency. The IRS defines cryptocurrencies as “a digital representation of value that functions as a medium of exchange, a unit of account, and/or a store of value” and has issued tax guidance accordingly.

Despite the muddied regulatory framework, the United States is seen as home to the largest number of crypto investors, exchanges, trading platforms, crypto mining firms and investment funds.

###Canada 
Canada has been an early adopter and is seen as quite “crypto-friendly” with several approvals of bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). 

Cryptocurrency is not a legal tender but the exchanges are legal and they have to register with the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC). In January 2018, Bank of Canada characterized them ‘technically’ as securities. Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) and the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada (IIROC) have issued guidance requiring crypto trading platforms and dealers in Canada to register with the local provincial regulators. Firms dealing with cryptos are considered money service businesses (MSBs) and must also register with FINTRAC. The requirements also apply to foreign-based firms if they have Canadian customers.

###Mexico
In March 2018, the Fintech law defined cryptocurrencies as the representation of the electronically registered value used by the general public as a means of payment for all types of legal transactions made only by electronic means. Mexico has also enacted a law that states that financial institutions dealing with cryptocurrencies should report transactions if the amount exceeds a certain limit. This rule is to comply with anti-money laundering laws.

###Bermuda
There is no specific legislation which governs the crypto industry in Bermuda. In 2017, the government launched a task force to advance the regulatory environment and develop Bermuda as a destination for utility tokens, tokenized securities, cryptocurrencies, and coin offerings. The task force was assigned to create a cryptocurrency association with a defined code of conduct and rules of operation. The Bermuda-based token issuers must join and comply with the code of conduct of the Bermuda Crypto Association, which includes measures to ensure enhanced business transparency, KYC, and AML.

##SOUTH AMERICA

###Brazil
Cryptocurrencies in Brazil are largely unregulated. Legislators have, however, begun to propose a series of regulations that might fill the void if enacted. The Brazilian Securities and Exchange Commission, or CVM has approved two crypto ETFs. The Brazilian government has declared that bitcoin is an asset and therefore is subject to capital gains taxes. Brazil has said that existing AML laws extend to virtual currencies in a few contexts. The Special Department of Federal Revenue of Brazil has published a document on cryptocurrency taxes in the country.

###Bolivia 
The Bolivian government banned the use of cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin in 2014, in the belief that it would facilitate tax evasion and monetary instability. “It is illegal to use any kind of currency that is not issued and controlled by a government or an authorized entity,” Bolivia’s central bank (BCB) said and declared it a “Pyramid scheme”.

###Costa Rica 
Cryptocurrencies are legal but the government is hostile and is not supported by central bank or state. AML laws apply.

###Chile
The Chilean government has committed to develop a regulatory and oversight framework for cryptocurrencies and the growing number of cryptocurrency exchanges in the country. In the absence of a legal framework, the Central Bank and the Financial Market Commission has said that existing regulations are applicable to cryptocurrencies.

###Colombia 
In Colombia there is no specific legislation regulating the use of cryptocurrencies. The Banco de la República, the country’s monetary, exchange and credit authority, and the Superintendencia Financiera de Colombia (SFC), the government agency responsible for overseeing financial regulation and market systems, released statements on cryptos warning they are not legal tender or valid investments for supervised entities, and firms are not authorized to advise or manage them. Though has stated that companies can legally purchase cryptos, however such “intangible assets” are unregulated. The country’s tax authority, Directorate of National Taxes and Customs (DIAN) said “virtual currencies are not money for legal purposes. However, in the context of mining activity, insofar as they are received in exchange for services and/or commissions, they correspond to income and, in any case, to goods that can be valued and generate income for those who obtain them as from be part of your patrimony and take effect in tax matters.”

###Uruguay
There is no specific legislation on cryptocurrencies in Uruguay. The Uruguayan Chamber of FinTech has, however, announced the formation of a cryptocurrency committee to analyze what future regulations might look like. The country is widely viewed as bitcoin and blockchain- friendly with no regulations specifically banning or permitting the use of cryptocurrencies.

###Venezuela
Prior to 2018, law enforcement arrested and seized assets of bitcoin miners but has now declared cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin legal. The Superintendency of Crypto-assets and Related Activities of Venezuela (SUPCACVEN) is the governmental agency in charge of regulations, control, and protection of crypto-assets.
The government of Venezuela has also created its own cryptocurrency called the Petro, which is backed by the value of Venezuelan oil.

###El Salvador 
El Salvador has certainly led the way for crypto adoption in Latin America. Only time will tell how its Bitcoin experiment will play out in the long run but it could serve as an example for countries looking to solidify their position in the crypto and blockchain economy. 

El Salvador isn’t just the first country to have made Bitcoin a part of everyday life, it has also subsidized Bitcoin mining efforts using renewable energy. If more countries make resources available for building blockchain infrastructure, this would be beneficial for crypto not only in Latin America, but worldwide.

###Mexico 
Mexico currently has a growing contingent of legislators who would like to see a more crypto-friendly legal framework. The country is also home to one of the largest crypto exchanges in the region, Bitso. Banco Azteca, one of the largest banks in the region, has also hinted at accepting Bitcoin in future. Crypto could greatly help the Mexican economy and provide a means for the unbanked to secure a form of financial autonomy. 

###Panama 
Panama is a strong contender to become the next country to fully endorse Bitcoin. Panamanian congressman Gabriel Silva has argued that “Panama cannot be left behind,” claiming that if the country wants to be “a true technology and entrepreneurship hub,” it needs to support cryptocurrencies.

###Paraguay 
Paraguay is seeking to attract international business and investment by passing legislation that will position it as one of the most crypto-friendly countries in the region. Additionally, the country has an abundance of electricity and renewable energy to help power Bitcoin mining efforts. 

###Venezuela 
Venezuela isn’t necessarily friendly toward decentralized cryptocurrencies, yet its economic circumstances are forcing many citizens to conduct business using Bitcoin. Venezuela’s government has already launched its own centralized digital currency, the Petro. However, most Venezuelans would prefer to hold decentralized currencies like Bitcoin. Remittances are also a big part of life for many Venezuelans and crypto can help avoid the associated fees for many families. 

The country legalized crypto mining in the fall of 2020 but with a caveat: miners must operate as part of a national digital mining pool. A growing number of people and businesses in Venezuela are accepting Bitcoin due to high inflation and a strained economy. 
  
###Ecuador 
Although Ecuador doesn’t expressly forbid crypto trading like Bolivia, the country is adamant about barring Bitcoin as legal tender for goods and services. The government has also repeatedly warned citizens that cryptocurrencies are highly speculative and are not a safe investment. 

##EUROPE

###Austria
The Financial Market Authority (FMA) has warned investors that cryptocurrencies are risky and that the FMA does not supervise or regulate them “Bitcoins are a virtual currency and are not subject to supervision by the Financial Market Authority. For some bitcoin-based business models, it may, however, be necessary to hold a license issued by the Financial Market Authority.” Virtual currencies are defined by the European Central Bank (ECB) as “a digital representation of value, not issued by a central bank, credit institution or e-money institution, which, in some circumstances, can be used as an alternative to money”.

###Russia
Mining is legal as it is viewed as an entrepreneurial activity. The activity will fall under taxation if the energy consumption limits set by the government are exceeded by the miner for three months consecutively. Recently, Russian lawmakers proposed a law that criminalizes buying bitcoin with cash. The offenders will have to face 7 years of imprisonment. In 2020, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed into a law that regulates digital financial asset transactions. Under the law which took effect on January 1, 2021, digital currencies are recognized as a payment means and investment. However, the digital currency cannot be used to pay for any goods and services. Previously digital currencies were banned. Russian banks and exchanges can become exchange operators of digital financial assets if they register with the Bank of Russia.

The Central Bank of Russia has also unveiled plans to develop a digital central bank currency, the Digital Ruble.

###Germany
The German Finance Ministry has treated Cryptocurrency as a ‘unit of account’ and stated that it can be used for trading in the country. It comes under the tax regulations and purchases made with it should additionally pay VAT as with euro transactions. Cryptocurrency stands as private money and the banks are allowed to sell and store them. The German government was one of the first countries to provide legal certainty to financial institutions allowing them to hold crypto-assets. Regulations stipulate that citizens and legal entities can buy or trade crypto-assets as long as it is done through licensed exchanges and custodians. Firms must be licensed with the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin). (AMLD5)

###Greece
The Hellenic Capital Market Commission views cryptocurrencies as portfolio assets and not currency. It requires providers of digital wallets, custody services, and exchange services between cryptos and fiat currencies to be registered.
Taxation for mining is considered income from commercial enterprises and the profits that will arise after deducting the operating expenses are taxed according to the
general provisions and the applicable tax rates. Holders of cryptocurrencies are taxed at a rate of 15% as income from capital gains. (AMLD5)

 
###United Kingdom
Cryptocurrency exchanges are legal if they are registered with the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (HMRC) has issued a brief on the tax treatment of cryptocurrencies, stating that their “unique identity” means they can’t be compared to conventional investments or payments, and their “taxability” depends on the activities and parties involved. Gains or losses on cryptocurrencies are, however, subject to capital gains tax. 

The UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), HM Treasury, and the Bank of England make up the country’s Crypto-assets Taskforce. The FCA has created regulations to cover know your customer (KYC), AML and CFT tailored for crypto-assets. It has also created regulations to cover virtual asset service providers (VASPs) but has been careful to not stifle innovation. Crypto exchanges must register with the FCA unless they have applied for an e-money license. Cryptocurrencies are not considered legal tender and taxes are levied based on activities. The FCA has banned the trading of cryptocurrency derivatives.

The UK published a call for evidence on digital assets in April 2021. The request seeks input from stakeholders ahead of publication of a consultation paper on digital assets which will make proposals for new laws.

###France
The cryptocurrency exchange should be registered with Autorité des Marchés Financiers (AMF). AMF is the regulator of the crypto industry in France. Article 26 of the PACTE Bill is designed to regulate initial coin offerings (“ICOs”), also called initial token offerings.  In April 2019, the French National Assembly adopted the Plan d’Action pour la Croissance et la Transformation de Enterprises (PACTE – Action Plan for Business Growth and Transformation) that will establish a framework for digital asset services providers. France’s Financial Market Authority (AMF) has adopted new rules and regulations for cryptocurrency service providers and ICOs, related to the (PACTE).

The French Ministry of Finance plans to propose new AML/ CFT rules related to digital assets. The new rules would impose new requirements on crypto exchanges and would prohibit anonymous accounts. The new regulations would better harmonize the French AML framework with Financial Action Task Force (FATF) principles and respond to new risks associated with digital assets.
 
###Italy
The cryptocurrency exchange should be registered with the Ministry of Finance. The taxation status is still in ambiguity and a clear set of laws are yet to be implemented. The revenue department has classified Bitcoin as a foreign currency and the profit through foreign currency trading is taxable as per the law. 

Italy joined the European Blockchain Partnership (EBP) along with 22 other countries in April 2018. The EBP was established to enable member states to work together with the European Commission on blockchain technology.

###Netherlands
The central bank of Netherlands known as De Nederlandsche Bank, DNB has been studying the opportunities and scope of blockchain and cryptocurrencies. In January 2018, they issued a statement stating that, ‘cryptocurrency does not currently fulfill the role of money.’ The Netherlands supports European Union’s Fifth Anti-Money Laundering Directive (5AMLD) that brings cryptocurrency- fiat currencies. Exchanges under the EU’s anti-money laundering legislation. Cryptocurrencies held by individuals are subjected to taxation under the clause of savings and investments.
 
###Turkey
Although not “illegal” in Turkey, authorities have demanded user information from crypto trading platforms. Turkey’s Central Bank has banned the use of cryptocurrencies, and other such digital assets based on distributed ledger technology cannot be used, directly or indirectly, to pay for goods and services. The central bank has said crypto-assets are “neither subject to any regulation and supervision mechanisms nor a central regulatory authority”.

###Switzerland
Cryptocurrencies are legal and are accepted as payment in some contexts. The exchanges are legal and must obtain a license from the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA). Exchanges are regulated by the Swiss Federal Tax Administration (SFTA). Cryptocurrencies are treated as assets and must be declared in annual income tax returns. In 2019, it was officially announced that the Swiss government is considering legislation that would encourage innovation in blockchain technology.
 
###Estonia
Cryptocurrencies are not considered as a legal tender. The exchanges are legal and must register with the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU). The regulatory framework includes strict reporting and KYC rules. Estonia is more crypto-friendly when compared to other EU member nations. The government regards cryptocurrencies as the ‘value represented in digital form’ and is treated as digital assets that fall under tax provisions. In January 2020, the government announced that virtual currency service providers will be treated the same as financial institutions under the Estonian Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Prevention Act.
 
###Luxembourg
Cryptocurrency exchanges are legal and must be registered with Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier (CSSF). In August 2018, authorities issued advice on the tax treatment of cryptocurrencies which, in a business context, depends on the type of transaction involved. In early 2019, lawmakers passed legislation that gave transactions performed using blockchain technology the same legal status as those done using traditional methods.
 
###Malta
Cryptocurrency exchanges are legal and must be registered under the Virtual Financial Assets Act (VFA). The country has a very positive approach to cryptocurrencies and they are recognized by the government as a medium of exchange, a unit of account, or a store of value. In 2018, the Maltese government introduced legislation to define a new regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies and address AML/CFT concerns. The Malta Digital Innovation Authority (MDIA) was also established which will be the government authority responsible for creating crypto policy, collaborating with other nations and organizations, and enforcing ethical standards for the use of crypto and blockchain technology.
 
###Denmark
The Danish Financial Supervisory Authority (FSA) is the main supervisory authority in Denmark. Cryptocurrency regulation is, however, influenced by EU law. An amendment in January 2020 to the Danish Act on Measures to Prevent Money Laundering and Financing of Terrorism defines a virtual currency as “a digital representation of value that is not issued or guaranteed by a central bank or a public authority, is not necessarily attached to a legally established currency and does not possess a legal status of currency or money, but is accepted by natural or legal persons as a means of exchange and which can be transferred, stored and traded electronically”.

The Danish central bank, the Nationalbanken, is working on developing a digital currency, the “e-krone.”

###Finland
In May 2019, Finland’s Financial Supervisory Authority (FSA) began regulating virtual currency exchange providers, wallets, and issuers of virtual currencies. Registration is required to ensure compliance with statutory requirements surrounding reliability of the provider, protection of client money, segregation of assets, marketing, and compliance with AML/CFT regulations.
The FSA has warned consumers of the risky, volatile and speculative nature of the investments. Finland has joined the European Blockchain Partnership and agreed to the AMLD5
 
###Gibraltar
Cryptocurrency exchanges are legal and must be registered with the Gibraltar Financial Services Commission (GFSC). The exchanges are mandatorily required to follow the principles of the DLT framework, which include a strong focus on the detection and disclosure of money laundering and terrorist financing. Further, they are subjected to pay a 10% corporate income tax.
 
###Slovenia
Slovenia treats cryptocurrencies as virtual currencies, meaning that they are neither financial instruments nor monetary assets under the Slovenian law on payment services and systems. The country updated its anti-money laundering law by explicitly referring to cryptocurrencies. The law defines all crypto-exchanges and brokers engaged in trade with cryptocurrencies as financial institutions for anti-money laundering purposes. Thus, such entities have to follow the transparency rules and compliance procedures applicable to financial institutions. The income obtained by individuals in the form of cryptocurrencies is subject to personal income tax.

###Spain
Spain was a notable early hot spot for cryptocurrencies among EU members, with merchants accepting payments and bitcoin kiosks in the streets. Despite no formal legal status, virtual currencies in Spain are taxable as income and under VAT. In 2021 the Spanish Securities and Exchange Commission, the Comision Nacional del Mercado de Valores (CNMV) and the Bank of Spain issued a joint statement warning of the risks and volatility. The joint statement also highlighted that, from a legal standpoint, cryptocurrencies are not a means of payment and are not backed by a central bank or other customer protection mechanisms or authority.
The Royal Decree Law 5/2021 included a provision giving the CNMV power to regulate advertising related to cryptocurrencies.

###Portugal
Despite issuing warnings about the risks related to cryptos, Portugal is widely seen as the most crypto-friendly country in Europe. The legal status of cryptocurrency in Portugal was officially clarified in a statement by the Portuguese tax authorities and was subsequently reaffirmed by the Journal de Negocios. Portugal does, however, follow EU regulation as has agreed to the AMLD5 

The country’s non-habitual tax regime (NHR) has attracted many crypto traders as it allows for exemptions and reductions in tax for a 10-year period for individuals of high cultural or economic worth. “An exchange of cryptocurrency for ‘real’ currency constitutes an on-demand, VAT-free exercise of services,” the Portuguese tax authorities have said.

###Georgia
In 2017, the National Bank of Georgia announced that cryptocurrency is not a legal tender and is not regulated by any law. The bank also urged people to be careful in dealing with cryptocurrencies and be aware of the potential risks involved before investing in it. The traders are not subjected to pay income tax for the same. 
 
###Belarus
In March 2018, the Presidential Decree on the development of the digital economy came into effect. This provision permits the buying, selling, exchanging, and mining cryptocurrency. The tax and currency regulations are extended only to legal entities operating from High Technologies Park, which is a special economic zone. The income generated through mining and trading cryptocurrencies is tax-free until 2023.
 
###Liechtenstein
In May 2019, the government reported that it passed a motion to implement a new law on the ‘Blockchain Act’. The Blockchain Act allows every possible asset, including real estate, bonds &amp; securities, to be tokenized, digitalized, and listed on a cryptocurrency exchange. The same year in the month of October, the legislature voted unanimously to approve the ‘Token and Trustworthy Technology Service Providers Act.’ With this law, Liechtenstein became the first country to comprehensively regulate the token economy.

###Bulgaria 
Cryptocurrencies are legal and treated as financial assets, and income from selling them is taxed accordingly.  However, firms providing services for cryptocurrencies such as exchanges and digital wallets are required to register with the National Revenue Agency and declare activities, as gains on transactions are taxable and treated as income. Bulgarian regulators have issued various standard warnings to the public and potential investors about risks associated with digital assets and ICOs. As a member of the EU, European Supervisory Authorities (EBA, EIOPA and ESMA) regulations and guidance apply.

###Czech Republic 
The Czech Government has moved to clamp down on illegal bitcoin use while moving to regulate it as a currency including taxing its transactions. Virtual exchanges must identify customers and is under EU regulatory frameworks. 

###Belgium
The Belgian Financial Services and Markets Authority and the National Bank of Belgium have published guidance and warnings to the public regarding scams and concerning investor protection. Belgium has, however, fostered a strong fintech community involved in digital assets and blockchain. Gains on cryptocurrencies are taxable by the Special Tax Inspectorate (STI) as “miscellaneous income”.

###Jersey
The territory of Guernsey within the British Isles is known as a Crown Dependency but is not part of the United Kingdom, rather a self-governing possession of the British Crown. In 2016 amendments to the Proceeds in Crime Law categorize virtual currency as a form of currency. Financial services business such as exchanges are subject to Jersey’s AML requirements and must comply with the island’s laws, regulations, policies and procedures related to AML and CTF.

Virtual currency exchanges are a supervised business and are required to register with, and fall under the supervision of, the Jersey Financial Services Commission (JFSC).

###Latvia
Latvia’s Financial and Capital Market Commission has warned investors that cryptocurrencies “operated in an infrastructure that is currently characterized by lower regulation than in the financial and capital markets.” In the past several years Latvia has launched an effort to improve its AML regulations. In 2019 it expanded the role of the Financial and Capital Market Commission to cover AML/ CTF and impose beneficial ownership requirements on local limited companies, foundations, unions, and other enterprises. The Latvian Finance Ministry imposes a 20% tax on capital gains from cryptocurrencies. Latvia signed a declaration creating the European Blockchain Partnership.

###Lithuania

Also known as virtual currencies, cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin is non-regulated digital money that can be used as means of payment, and this money is issued and guaranteed by a non-central bank. Lithuania requires crypto firms to register with the country’s Center of Registers. Registrants must adopt comprehensive KYC and AML procedures and are expected to inform the Financial Crime Investigation Service (FCIS) about large transfers.

In a June 2020 report from the EU, Lithuania has made progress towards eliminating gaps in its regulation and supervision of cryptocurrency and claims to have gone beyond requirements in the fifth EU Anti-Money Laundering Directive (AMLD 5). Lithuania State Tax Inspectorate considers cryptos as “property” and asses a 15% rate on the gains.

###The Netherlands

personalfinance,"How to minimize tax impact (and other considerations) from selling rental property(ies). US, FL/GA And why am I getting soaked for capital gains?","* Bought a home in 2009 for $300,000
* Lived in the house until 2015.
* Rented it to tenants until 2021.
* Sold in 2021 for $285,000.
* Tax accountant (a real CPA, not HR Block) says we're going to have a $12,000 tax liability on capital gains.  
  
I understand at the 5-year-old level that property depreciates, which I think reduces the cost basis. But I wouldn't think depreciation would take my cost basis from $300K to $225K in six years.  
  
Other background that I don't know if it matters:  
The rent payment for all 6 years did not cover the mortgage (PITI) payment, not to mention the management fees (we had a local property management company). As a result, we paid no federal or state income tax on income from the property.  
Our household income is approx $250K, no dependents, and no other capital gains.  
We have another rental property with a very similar situation (my son lived in it with his wife for two years, rented since 2016.
We're not in a position to purchase another rental property to ""roll over"" the gains.",finance
personalfinance,Can my mortgage provider force me to keep a bank account with them,"I recently bought a house and have a mortgage through Lakeland bank. After the closing I was informed that I needed to create a bank account with them or else my interest rate goes up by .25%. I’ve never heard of this at any other bank (I have another house which has a mortgage with Fulton which didn’t force this). Is this allowed? 

The reason I ask is because I wanted all my accounts to be under one umbrella (Jpm) to make my life easy. 

Thanks!",finance
personalfinance,What do you think of using margin as first line of defense emergency fund?,"Both my husband and I are self employed and go through long periods of high fluctuations of salary. We have one year of emergency savings. I could get this up to two but with such a low yield interest rate right now I feel it’s just losing value for no reason. So my other idea is to use our margin maybe a “lower” percentage do it doesn’t get called in a bad market like up to 20 percent and use it as my first line of defense. 

Thoughts? 

So essentially if I need it, I would borrow on margin first. I would then keep my one year cash in case of margin calls and to possibly buy myself up to 2plus years in emergency funds depending on market conditions.",finance
personalfinance,Is using TIPS in a laddered emergency fund a good idea?,"Right now I've got my emergency fund up to 6 months of expenses. I know the traditional advice is to have it all just as cash, but I wasn't too happy with that since interest rates are so low and inflation is running a bit high at the moment. I was thinking of putting 3 months of the fund into [Vanguard's VTAPX fund](https://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/profile/vtapx), which contains short-term TIPS. My understanding is that the backing bonds have the principal guaranteed and its increases are tied to inflation, which makes it a very low-risk hedge against inflation. Even in a deflationary environment, the principal is preserved.

I think the worst risk here is if an emergency crops up in the very near future that requires my entire fund and a price fluctuation causes a decrease in the principal, but even then historical fluctuations have been so low that I don't think it would matter that much.

Does this plan make sense? What am I missing? Thanks!",finance
Bitcoin,Bitcoin Is Not a Fiat Currency Competitor but Rather a Revolution in Your Very Relationship With Money,"The Bitcoin revolution continues to progress. Block after block, Bitcoin continues to move forward while staying true to its fundamentals. It cannot be otherwise, because Bitcoin's monetary policy is programmatic. There is no room for chance or human arbitrariness with Bitcoin.

That's why Bitcoin is so special. It gives incredible guarantees to its users.

In a world as uncertain as ours, this is priceless. More and more people are realizing this. As a result, people are coming to buy Bitcoin to take advantage of its monetary revolution.

### Bitcoin is not a competitor to the U.S. dollar or the euro

As the success of Bitcoin intensifies month after month, economists, central bankers, and journalists begin to denigrate Bitcoin in every way possible. As always, these opponents of Bitcoin use fallacious arguments that have already been proven time and time again.

Rather than attacking Bitcoin out of fear of this major technological disruption, these people should start studying how Bitcoin works. If they took the time to do that, then they would realize that Bitcoin is not a competitor to fiat currencies.

You read well. Bitcoin is not a competitor to the U.S. dollar or the euro.

Rather, the digital currency invented by Satoshi Nakamoto is a revolution in our very relationship with money. It is a major paradigm shift that will change your life forever if you choose to take advantage of the freedom this system offers.

### In the current system, your money is not available at all times

With the current monetary and financial system, you are forced to trust others to secure the fruits of your labour. You earn money that is in the bank. Banks do not even own all the money of their depositors at any given time.

If you want to know more about this, I encourage you to look at what the reserve requirement rate is.

It represents the financial reserves that banks and other financial institutions are required to deposit with the central bank. The reserve requirement rate allows commercial banks to save a portion of their income. It is therefore a safety net.

In the United States, it is the Fed that sets this reserve requirement rate.

At the end of March 2020, to better face the COVID-19 pandemic, the Fed decided to set this reserve requirement rate at zero allowing banks to use more liquidity to lend money to individuals and businesses.

### Bankers and governments can censor you for arbitrary reasons

With a zero reserve requirement rate, if all depositors wanted their money back at the same time, the banks would be unable to meet these demands. They would go bankrupt.

This is a major problem for individuals who cannot have their money available when they want it. In addition to this problem of the availability of the fruits of your labour, banks, and governments also have the power to control and censor your transactions in the current banking system.

A government can decide at any time to freeze your assets for totally arbitrary reasons.

The problems do not stop there. The ability of central banks to print as much fiat money out of thin air as they deem necessary is problematic for the majority of the world's inhabitants. It keeps devaluing the money already in circulation, which deprives you of your right to save the fruits of your labour.

If you save money in the current system, you mechanically lose money because of the decisions of a minority of people who are not representative of the people.

### Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin to change people's relationship to money

These edifying facts led Satoshi Nakamoto to create a different system that belongs to the people:

 *“The root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that's required to make it work. The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust. Banks must be trusted to hold our money and transfer it electronically, but they lend it out in waves of credit bubbles with barely a fraction in reserve. We have to trust them with our privacy, trust them not to let identity thieves drain our accounts. Their massive overhead costs make micropayments impossible.”* 

 Bitcoin was created to change the very relationship of its users to money.

Rather than being subject to the decisions of a minority of people, **Bitcoin puts each individual back in the** **centre** **of the game**. Bitcoin works for you and all its users.

With Bitcoin, you can save your money without fear. **Bitcoin's maximum supply is 21 million units, and that will never change**. No one has any interest in it. This gives you an incredible guarantee: 1 BTC of today will always equal 1 BTC of 21 million in 10, 20, or 50 years.

### Bitcoin is the truth of the people verifiable at any time

Bitcoin's programmatic monetary policy lets you know exactly what will happen in the coming months and years to the supply of Bitcoin. You won't get a nasty surprise when you wake up one morning. That's why more and more people are coming to buy Bitcoin.

Bitcoin is a transparent system that allows all its users to audit their accounts at any time. All you have to do is run your node. **While fiat money is the truth of government, Bitcoin is THE truth**. This may sound presumptuous, but it is since anyone can check it at any time.

So there is nothing hidden with Bitcoin. All users have the right to check that the system is following the rules that were originally defined by Satoshi Nakamoto.

Bitcoin will probably never completely replace the current monetary and financial system. Many people will remain attached to this system that reassures them by leaving them in a comfortable lie. For the others, those who want to discover the unpleasant but liberating truth, Bitcoin will be there.

### Final Thoughts

Bitcoin will become the money of the Internet used by all those who have discovered the truth about the current system and want to take real care of their money future.

The hardest money in the world that gives citizens around the world power over their money. **Once you have the power over your money back**, **you will be able to live your life on your terms**. This is priceless in my eyes.

It's up to you whether you want to discover the inconvenient truth that will allow you to regain control over your money, or stay in a comfortable lie that will leave you under the thumb of a flawed system that will eventually collapse.

EDIT
_____

Thanks to everyone who responded. I have a few questions and follow ups. I think I'll go with Fidelity because they have an app and I just like it better innately, unless anyone has a strong reason for Vanguard.

Initially I thought that once I put money into my company 401k and Roth IRA that I am not allowed to take it out until retirement, I then discussed it with a friend who is investment savvy and he said that I can create another investment that isn't a Roth and am freely to withdraw as long as it's been in there for a year and if the profit isn't &gt;$40k, I am able to withdraw before retirement, is this true?

My concern was, if I dump a good chunk of my current pooled money into investments I'll lose some of it, if the market is ""bad"" and I won't be able to take it out should I want to make a big purchase - like a down payment on house.

So, this is what I am thinking:

* Keep my 3% match in my 401k (should I be maxing this out, if so why, $19,500 is steep)

* Create a Roth IRA with Fidelity and invest in FSKAX or others if there's suggestions?

 * There's a total US market and International, are both good?

 * Create another investment that's not Roth IRA and dump $50k also into FSKAX

* How can I learn how to pick ""individual investments"" that's not a Index Fund? These will be risks though correct? My friend suggested look for companies with large ""Market Cap""

* Keep $10k or so in Checking Account for spending, monthly expenses etc.

* Just want to know if I am understanding this correctly. My medical doesn't have interest and school loans are frozen on interest for now so I am leaving them as is.",finance

Looking at the Nasdaq index options, it says that I can buy a box spread for a min invest of -300k on a large spread, with a max gain and loss both being equal to 11k.

I really like to find jobs on these platforms but some of them just take out so much money, especially when I am based in an area where the income is not very high (I know, you have to pay your taxes, but you don't have to pay 24% to middlemen like Upwork, Fiverr, PayPal).

Where can I earn Bitcoin for my online work without paying so many fees? I do a lot of art, web development, social media, and marketing. Anyone else fed up with these damn fees?

personalfinance,Ally Trifecta? pointless or am I missing unseen oppurtunity?,"First off, thanks for all yalls posts and comments I learn everyday on here. But to get to it..

Next month I will be starting my emergency fund and from reading and searching on here, it seems Ally, AMEX, and Marcus by GS are the top 3 suggested in terms of a HYSA. I am leaning towards Ally because I would have the ability to also move my checking account with them, which from a consolidation standpoint, seems very nice. So they offer the interest checking and the money market account that could both go with the HYSA.

So my question is, Is there a benefit to opening all 3?

I know the savings and money market have a 6 transaction limit. (not sure if those are separate or count together). So for me it seems the interest checking and HYSA would suffice. Unlimited transactions seem nice because I tend to pay my credit cards off daily, which will result in easily more than 6 transactions (residual side affects of dad yelling at the teen version of me about interest rates and to only use cash lol) . Also the ability to move HYSA to checking account for instant access via the debit card would be a nice plus.

At the end of the day if I open all 3 it would be no fees but besides the increased APY on the money market am I missing out on anything?? I may attempt the 3 and see if I can get in a routine of only paying card of once or twice a month.

Edit for additional clarity\*

I plan to open the HYSA and the interest checking. Am I missing an opportunity outside of the APY by not opening the Money market to use as my checking instead. or is the an advantage to having all 3 that I don't see?",finance

stocks,Is there a reason to not short bonds in low interest rate environments?,"Obviously there's no ""free money hack"" in the markets (other than arbitrages that retail investors can't do). But given that bonds move inversely of interest rates, and interest rates are really low, isn't there asymmetric downside compared to upside? If rates are near 0 then they can only really go up which means shorting bonds should be a pretty decent trade. Is the risk in that bonds can potentially have negative rates? Ignoring transaction costs, cost to borrow etc. is there a reason why I wouldn't want to do this? It seems high probability to me. Thanks!",finance

I appreciate the honesty. And to clarify a bit, my cc debt is more like 70k CAD spread out over 8 accounts. I own enough crypto to zero it out but....I haven't yet. Interest rates vary the lowest is 9.99% and the highest is 19.99%

personalfinance,Seeking advice on whether to sell my house to fix my current financial situation.,"As the title says, looking for opinions and advice on whether we should sell our house to pay off debts.
Currently owe 270k on our mortgage, could sell now for about $425k and net ~125k after fees.
We owe about $50k between defaulted student loans, high interest personal loan, and minimal cc debt. 
We have only been in the house 16 months so we would be obligated to pay capital gains taxes on the sale which would be 15% if I understand correctly, of the total before fees so about $23k. 
Our current interest rate, refinanced in March to remove PMI, is 3.7% due to less than stellar credit.
My concern is after taxes and fees we would have about $50k give or take to pit down on a new house, which is fine for what we are looking for, but do you guys think it makes sense to do this? 
Would my credit score and rating go up significantly and in what timeframe (currently 680 Experian and 620-630 Credit Karma) to be able to purchase a new home at a better interest rate in the future? We would prefer not to rent for very long in the interim but I don’t want to settle for the first mortgage offer at the same or higher interest rate out of convenience. 
The payments for all debt combined is about $1100/mo. Mortgage is $1500/mo, all other bills / utilities are about $1400/mo. We take home about $4300/mo, so there isn’t a ton of room to throw more money at the debt every month.

Or does it make more sense to do the Ramsey method and strip our budget to the bare minimum and just pay everything we can at the debt and stay in the house? 

Thanks in advance for any replies!!!",finance

personalfinance,Question about repo'd vehicle,"I recently got my chapter 7 full discharge which is great news. I opted to keep the vehicle. However, after coming back from out of town for a week I saw that it had been repossessed. I think I was 4 months behind. The purchase was not a good move - I traded in a fairly new car that was valued much higher just to get my monthly payment down, so in essence this car was worth about 13k but I owed 21k. I know, stupid decision.

So in a panic I called GM Financial to see what I could do to get it back. Unfortunately the reinstatement department was off on a saturday and told me to try back Monday. I did ask the CSR what my options are, and she said that they will want to work with me, and may allow me to get the car back with a payment plan. I don't know how true this is as I've never had a car repo'd before. So, panicking, I started looking at a plan B. I called around a few dealerships that specialize in bad credit and got approved for 21k, max payment $510, with 7.75 APR (terrible rate). I could be back driving by Monday.

My question(s) are should I just not try to get the car back since I'm so upside down on it, and go with a used car with this high interest rate? The car that got repo'd has 71,000 miles on it and I still owe 21k. With getting another car I won't be upside down and probably plan on spending around 10-12k for it, with lower miles than my 70k car. Any advice would be much appreciated. Thank you.",finance

Schwab has a pledged asset line program that has low interest rates too).

Fund 5 voting is up and we’d love your support for our little project that we’re piecing together. 

We’re doing direct ADA payments from user to store owner with no third party provider. 

Will be released as an open source project and supported by a team of WordPress developers to help improve and support users integrating the plugin on their sites. 

With over 5,000,000 active WooCommerce active sites accepting payments for goods and services around the world, I would see a small 1% active installations of the plugin as a win. 

We’ve build the initial plugin and will release it this week for everyone to have a play gathering feedback, testing and open it up for collaboration. 

We’d love 💕 your vote 🗳 and support for the project. It will spawn other solutions for other payment gateways. 

We’ve taken inspiration from other previously built plugins for Shopify ADA payments and previous fund work on accepting and triggering events on acceptance to payment to a wallet. 

We’ve been building plugins and extensions for WordPress and Joomla for the last 10 years and manage sites from small businesses all the way to Federal Government sites and corporations such as Channel 9, Fairfax Media, Pacific Hunter, Rockpool Dining Group, High Court of Australia and many more. 

Look for the project under dApps and Integrations.

32. We saw segments on various newer partner entities like Nervos, Orion Protocol, and Revuto. Nervos is a UTXO proof-of-work blockchain which is building a cross-chain bridge with Cardano so that you can use your ADA on Nervos dApps and vice versa. Interoperability is a big theme for Nervos and they plan to have a working testnet within a month. Orion Protocol is building a terminal that will allow for decentralized non-custodial trading across centralized and decentralized exchanges. They say this would not require you to KYC or even have an account with any of these exchanges. Revuto is an online subscription management service that recently completed a $10MM token sale on Cardano.
33. It was also revealed that Wolfram Labs, COTI, and IOHK have a three-way partnership (a ménage à tech) to build an NFT auction site. The people from Wolfram were talking about very interesting things including live minting during streaming events and automated upload to IPFS. COTI will be building out auction and bidding mechanisms in ADAPay.
34. Professor Aggelos Kiayias gave us an update on research including that Ouroboros Chronos and Hydra papers have both been accepted into conferences/journals. Chronos will provide Cardano with a global concept of time that doesn’t rely on any outside timekeeper. Prof. Kiayias also pointed out that Hydra is distinguishable from other layer two protocols in that the scripting language is identical to that of the base layer in Cardano such that any dApp that can run on Cardano will run on the Hydra L2. This is a huge plus and superior to many other layer two solutions in other ecosystems where the base layer dApps will not run on layer two. Finally, the Mithril paper has been submitted for peer review. It will provide Cardano light wallets with Succinct Non-interactive Arguments of Knowledge that will give us the best of both worlds: no delays for syncing as in full node wallets while still preserving trustlessness.

37. People are starting to realize that the Stakehound private key loss in ETH may attract unwanted regulatory attention to Ethereum 2.0 while this problem could never have occurred in Cardano. Also, only a few days later another ETH stakepool (this time SharedStake...the sixth biggest ETH Stakepool) allegedly experiences a rugpull that some are valuing at over $30MM. This is another problem that could not happen in Cardano staking. It feels like we stepped into the ring, they rang the bell, and ETH just started punching itself in the head.

Very interesting timing with a) Grayscale Buying $50MM ETCG, b) Grayscale adding ADA, and c) Charles joining the ETC Cooperative board given that two of the members of the ETC Cooperative board seem to come from Grayscale and DCG.

In news that could have significant repercussions for many stablecoin reliant Cardano DeFi projects, Fed Chair Jerome Powell gave some hard signals that they will regulate stablecoins in House Committee testimony. He revealed that the Fed will issue its long-awated paper on stablecoins, CBDCs, and other digital assets in September. Powell also went as far as to say ""You wouldn't need stable coins you wouldn't need cryptocurrencies if you had a digital US currency, I think that's one of the stronger arguments in its favor.""

The El Faro article reporting meetings between Cardano, Whizgrid of Cyprus, and the brothers of President Bukele of El Salvador definitely contain some extremely interesting details related to a possible Salvadorean national stablecoin by the end of the year and a possible digitization and blockchain storage of a wide range of government related documents next year.

98. Notable news for upcoming Cardano DeFi projects. There may be slightly less competition in the “get a return on your crypto assets” game very soon. The New Jersey AG’s office has delivered a cease and desist letter to BlockFi. The AG’s press release cited BlockFi’s interest bearing deposit accounts as unregistered securities and also mentioned the lack of FDIC or SPIC insurance for it’s depositors. This leaves some lingering questions for Cardano DeFi projects that might be planning to accept deposits or other transfers of value and offering a return of sorts. You could argue that these projects are decentralized where BlockFi was not. But, the AG’s press release seems to cite decentralization as one of the risks of DeFi projects. Also, as a practical matter, there is a question whether decentralization will be a good shield from regulators since many of these projects have companies and real humans with faces and names behind them unlike a truly anonymous founder such as Satoshi Nakamoto.

100. Cardano didn’t come up in the Cathie Wood, Jack Dorsey, and Elon Musk panel discussion at “The B Word” event.

personalfinance,Is Fidelity's SPAXX a scam?,"Hi everyone,

Due to the uncertainty in the future, I decided to not invest in funds for now, and I have around 10,0000 in fidelity as cash.

However, i noticed that fidelity put those money in SPAXX, and it has a crazy high expense ratio (0.46%)

My question is - is this a scam? Should i move my money elsewhere given that the interest rate is like 0.01%

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks in advance!",finance

CryptoCurrency,"Moons: more than just wealth, more than us","I love that moons give people who wouldn't otherwise have means to wealth a road to access an income for themselves.  Our third world friends can benefit substantially from doing not much else other than interacting with the community. This is a good thing. Redistributing wealth is something that cryptocurrency is all about, and to see that in action warms my heart. 

We're all god. We're all one. Seeing you all make money interacting with me and others makes me so happy. 

Crypto is greater than us, it's about giving people access to wealth in a way that they've never had, without a bank breathing down their neck or the loan shark charging jacked up interest rates. We're all cosmic love. 

Remember what crypto is supposed to be, especially once Elon and Jeff Bezos try to cash in down the line. This is for us; not just a means for the rich to get richer. Don't let crypto becomes the next real estate, just a way for rich people to screw us over. 

Be love and may your coins all moon.

CryptoCurrency,Best Crypto Interest Rates 25 Jul 2021,[removed],cryptocurrency
CryptoCurrency,Crypto Lending Platforms,"I still struggle to comprehend people who intend to hold their coins long-term, but still, hold their coins on exchanges, only waiting for their coins to appreciate . There are numerous CeFi and DeFi lending platforms that can help you get yield and interest on your tokens when you hold them. And today I'll be listing their interest rates for you to help you make an informed decision on where you want to put your tokens to work!

I personally have some tokens in celsius, nexo and Kucoin (KCS). As well as Cake Defi as my form of passive income

There's a shit ton of applications and other staking websites I didn't list.

Do feel free to add and comment on others you recommend!

PM me for Celsius and Cake Defi referrals

**DeFi**

Demand for borrowing in the DeFi world comes as a result of either margin trading on decentralized exchanges or from borrowing on DeFi applications.Due to the majority of DeFi applications being on the Ethereum network, borrowing and lending consists mainly of Ethereum, ERC-20 tokens, and wrapped Bitcoin, which is an ERC-20 token that is backed 1:1 with Bitcoin. The business model of the platforms can differ slightly.

||AAVE|DDEX|Cream|Fulcrum|Compound|dYdX|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|BTC|0.06%|0%|0.37%|0%|0.53%|0%|
|ETH|1.02%|0.39%|2.23%|0.32%|0.27%|0.08%|
|USDT|2.14%|6.74%|4.32%|5.94%|1.94%|0%|
|USDC|2.13%|6.88%|3.44%|2.65%|1.87%|1.64%|
|DAI|2.4%|0.19%|2.38%|6.29%|2.48%|1.27%|

&amp;#x200B;

**CeFi**

In addition to DeFi lending there are also many centralized crypto lending companies. Because loan origination happens in a centralized fashion with these companies, the interest rates are typically more stable as the lending entity sets the rate rather than pure market forces. Interest rates on centralized lending platforms are usually higher than other platforms, which is appealing to lenders.

Banking,Younger person wanting to start saving,"Hi,

In 21F in the UK. I currently have a current account (no interest) and a savings account (0.01% interest) in which I can take and move money freely.

I was interested in putting away larger sums of money for bigger interest payoffs, but I'm not sure where to start.

I have read a little about compound interest and i am interested. My bank offers a fixed-term account where I can deposit an amount (I'm thinking ~£1000) for an interest rate of 0.45% if I dont take it out. The interest would be paid back into the account.

Am I right in thinking this is compound interest? And any advice for somebody young wanting to get into this?",finance

personalfinance,Guaranteed Rate Mortgage v Wells Fargo?,"Just got an offer accepted on our first home. Wells Fargo pre approval gave us a 2.85 interest rate with points. Then our broker recommended we reach out to guaranteed rate, and he is offering us 2.62 with no points and no prepayment penalties. 

How is this possible, can it be legit? I’ve never heard of the company but it’s our first home so that’s understandable since they only do mortgage loans. 

I will certainly float these numbers back past Wells Fargo to see if they can match, but what are peoples thoughts?  Is it safe to go with guaranteed rate if they have the lowest rate?

personalfinance,How does the federal solar ITC work?,"I am about to get a solar array installed on my home for which I was told I would receive almost $6000 in federal tax credits.

 Having looked at the IRS website’s form 5695, the Residential Energy Efficient Property Credit Limit Worksheet, as well as schedule 3 of form 1040. It appeared that this credit would simply look at the tax i am supposed to be liable for… (Referencing for 1040) say $27000 from line 16 and deduct the ITC (~$6000) on line 20 plus any other credits. 

So line 24 would be $27000 - $6000 = $21000. Then looking at line 25D and line 33, assuming total witholding was $28000, line 34 would be $28000 - $21000 = $7000. Which should be the amount i ‘overpaid’ hence that would be my refund on line $35a?

personalfinance,Can you use a mortgage pre-approval from one lender to negotiate with another?,"Hello PF! I am in the offering stage of house hunting, and I came across an interesting situation. I have a pre-approval from an online only mortgage lender that has an interest rate of 2.625% with an APR of 2.766% (which is by far the lowest I've seen) with no points/credits. My realtor strongly urged me to go with local lenders because they tend to look stronger on an offer, especially in the seller's market the world is experiencing now. I got my quote from the local lender and another one close by, and they both come with an interest rate of 2.875%, annualized at 3.08%, also without points/credits. 

My question is can I use the former quote to negotiate with the brick and mortar lender to be more competitive?

For perspective, I am looking at a 30year conventional loan with 5% down (never owned a home before, starting from scratch) and a credit score of 766 (middle score of the 3 bureaus). At this time I can only afford to put down 5% comfortably and still have a cushion with room to partially furnish the house. The price is about $276k.

I understand it looks better to go with a known lender, but an extra 0.3% on the largest loan of my life thus far seems like a high price to pay for an advantage.",finance
solar,Electrical Service Upgrade / V2X / Solar,"not quite sure which subreddit is best to post this in.. but hopefully its ok here.

Im looking to install an EVSE charger and will likely need to upgrade my electrical service.  While Im doing this, Im trying to plan out for how I can eventually support a solar / battery backup solution for my house.  


Right now I have:  
\- 150A circuit breaker panel  
\- Ive been told my service entrance needs to be upgraded, as it was not large enough for 150A  
\- 9.8kw PV system (SolarEdge inverter) fed to panel via taps  
\- All breakers are full, but I have no tandems.  (Only 240v breakers are 30A dryer and 30A heat pump)  


I would like to add a 50A circuit for my EVSE, but could get away with 40A...  Longer term, I would like to use bidrectional charging (V2X) to power some key circuits during extended grid outages, and then charge EV from solar.  I know there is nothing on the market right now that can do this, but [wallbox quasar](https://wallbox.com/en_us/quasar-dc-charger) is supposedly coming this year, and Im hopeful more will follow in the future.  Since it seems like Im going to need a significant electrical upgrade for an EVSE, I'm trying to do it with V2X charging in mind.

Any advice on how to proceed?  What sort of wiring should I run to EV charging location? Im wondering if it would be worth installing a smart panel like [Span](https://www.span.io/smart-panel-product) which can handle the grid disconnect and let you choose the backup circuits.",energy

Medical transportation and logistics has been huge with covid but will soon be back to normal and they cant maintain the growth, with a PE of 66 im scared plus so much revenue is based on government contracts  I'm avoiding.

WalMart: WMT

Not going to outperform, never going away. Would buy at discount, wont buy open market.

Dick's:  DKS

their financials seem really good. I dont know how but they are crushing it. The ones local to me dont seem to do much business. But revenue, profits, doing great.

* $28k in company 401k, set to 11% contributions w/ some company matching
* Around $56k in bank, split between checking and savings accounts
* Have approx $7k in bonds from grandparents
* Credit score somewhere around ~750
* Live in a fairly HCOL area of Orange County, in SoCal
* Unsure of monthly spending, but I make more than I spend currently

At this point should I be looking to maximize my investments? I know I should probably set up an IRA, but other than that I've no idea where to go.

* Should I be cashing in my bonds?
* How much should I be putting in to investments, and how much should I be keeping in the bank?

personalfinance,My wife filed her taxes completely wrong and I have no idea where we go from here.,"My wife and I married in Feb. Of 2020. We jumped into the marriage and neither of us had/have any clue what marriage means come tax time. I wanted to consult a tax attorney for this reason, as well given the fact I need an IP (identity protection) PIN from the IRS before I can file and we never received this PIN.

We were hard on money, and we're told briefly by a vague IRS agent that for me to file without my PIN would delay our taxes several months. So my wife went ahead and filed, unbeknownst to me, on her own as head of household. Also should be noted our first and only daughter was born in November of 2020, and my wife claimed out daughter on her returns. 

My wife, for some reason, listed $25k of MY unemployment (I was on unemployment from April of 2020 thru the remainder of the year), as well as the $10k unemployment tax credit. I just noticed she did this, and when pointed out, she realized her mistake. 

She filed her taxes electronically through TurboTax in early may, and TurboTax said her returns (fed and state) were accepted. Up until a few days ago, we were able to check the refund stats on the IRS website, ehich said they were being processed. TurboTax originally said she was getting back around $2400. She checked her status in TurboTax a few days ago and this amount had changed (increased slightly) without notice. Since we noticed this amount change, the IRS tool has not let us check the status (it keeps saying the entered information is incorrect). 

So, I have a few questions:

1. Being that my wife and I are still married and together, is her filing Head of Household a big mistake? Should we file jointly and tackle my IP pin issue together?

2. What is going to happen with her claiming my unemployment and associated tax credit on her return? It's sure to get rejected, right?

3. What should we do now? Do we file an amended return? Wait for confirmation of rejection, and then refile electronically? 

4. Unrelated to our tax return nightmare I guess, but will we be eligible to receive the new monthly child tax credit that started in July? Or does our/her 2020 return need to be accepted before we can begin receiving this? 

5. What the hell do we do now, lol. I'm lost.

personalfinance,Excess Student Loans Sitting in Savings Account (USA),"Hello,

I enrolled in graduate school last fall, and I'll be graduating this winter. I decided to live on my own for this program and I've been able to afford my rent/utilities/life, but I haven't had much leftover for savings. 

I've taken out federal loans for this graduate program and I've maxed out how much I've taken out every semester, approx. 10k. Half of that 10k has gone to paying tuition, and the other half has gone to my savings account. 

I've been maxing out my loans every semester and sending the remainder to a spare savings account in case I run into any emergencies and can't afford it with my current income. However, that has not happened yet, and (fingers crossed), won't happen by the time I graduate. 

So when I graduate this winter, I'll have approx. 8-9k in student loans that I'll need to pay off. I'll also have approx 15k from the student loans sitting in my bank account that I have not touched.   

Would the wisest thing to do as soon as I graduate and find a more stable/better paying job, to just dump that 15k back into the student loans, and just continue pecking away at the rest of my loans?

Or how long should I be holding onto that 15k, how do I figure that out? 

I'm scared of not having that safety net, and I haven't been able to build up one made of my own income just yet.",finance

cardano,"Cardano Rumor Rundown July 26, 2021","Hey Everyone!

Let's go...

Newly covered today: 

1. Reports are coming in that Amazon plans to integrate Bitcoin, Cardano, ETH, &amp; BCH in the very near future. This has apparently been a work in progress for several years.  [https://www.cityam.com/amazon-definitely-lining-up-bitcoin-payments-and-token-confirms-insider/](https://www.cityam.com/amazon-definitely-lining-up-bitcoin-payments-and-token-confirms-insider/)
2. Adam Dean brings you open source code to accept ADA in your Woo Commerce store! [https://twitter.com/adamKDean/status/1419495005983371264](https://twitter.com/adamKDean/status/1419495005983371264)

Previously Covered but still interesting:

1. Vitalik is saying it’s highly unlikely we see ETH 2.0 before late 2022. I’m guessing that means mid 2023 which will be after two years of Cardano slaughtering the entire ETH user base. Things are looking so bad that Vitalik says he doesn’t even like using the ETH 2.0 label anymore since he knows the changes will be more incremental. This is what early capitulation sounds like guys. [https://cointelegraph.com/news/even-vitalik-buterin-is-surprised-at-just-how-long-eth2-is-taking](https://cointelegraph.com/news/even-vitalik-buterin-is-surprised-at-just-how-long-eth2-is-taking)
2. Cardano-Nervos cross-chain bridge to be built. This would be at least the second cross-chain bridge after the Cardano-AGI bridge. [https://www.coindesk.com/cardano-nervos-force-bridge-network-first](https://www.coindesk.com/cardano-nervos-force-bridge-network-first)

4. Binance has 63 stakepools charging 6%. Please stop paying so much for the right to stake your ADA. You don’t have to pay that much. You have a huge number of better options. You are literally giving away your ADA rewards to a large corporation. It’s easy: just download the Yoroi Chrome extension, send your ADA there, and pick from the 2k+ available stakepools right inside Yoroi.

15. President of Tanzania calls on the central bank to prepare for the adoption of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. I wonder what crypto ecosystem already has experience working with an African government on a big crypto project and has partnered with a mobile company that is already bringing connectivity to rural Tanzania?

16. With exploits like this one being all too common in the legacy smart contract networks, we’re not even going to have sell the Cardano use case for DeFi. The competitor networks have already made the case that something better must be on the way.

19. While renewable energy is certainly a wonderful thing, there may be a problem with your technology when your path to compete on clean energy consumption involves you talking about harnessing the power of a whole series of volcanoes. Maybe just use fewer volcano’s and more proof-of-stake? [https://twitter.com/\_eLaPs\_/status/1404125569093029889](https://twitter.com/_eLaPs_/status/1404125569093029889) [https://twitter.com/gladstein/status/1402718041557725184](https://twitter.com/gladstein/status/1402718041557725184)

21. The bank of England is getting very serious about how it “may wish to limit migration” of money from the legacy system to stablecoins. Wow. Just another example of why it’s such an asset (no pun intended) that Cardano is prepared for regulation.

24. It’s a good sign that the top two crypto communities are spending so much time talking negatively about Cardano. You only focus your hatred on that which is most threatening. I’m glad to see we’re the biggest threat on their radar. [https://twitter.com/nic\_\_carter/status/1405194146063736840](https://twitter.com/nic__carter/status/1405194146063736840)

26. All 345,501 of the people who have watched the Lex Fridman/Charles episode as of writing are realizing that Cardano could be the first project to put voting on the blockchain in a U.S. state. [https://www.atalaprism.io/app](https://www.atalaprism.io/app)
27. It looks like the second biggest ETH stakepool or it's custody provider has lost it’s users private keys to $75MM in ETH. Cardano doesn’t have this problem. We get to keep custody of our crypto because we found a better way than slashing. [https://stakehound.com/blog-post/fireblocks-eth-2-key-management-incident/](https://stakehound.com/blog-post/fireblocks-eth-2-key-management-incident/) [https://twitter.com/JamesSpediacci/status/1407465311180255236](https://twitter.com/JamesSpediacci/status/1407465311180255236)

30. The June Cardano 360 is currently available on Youtube. [https://youtu.be/al5m14299ww](https://youtu.be/al5m14299ww)
31. We saw segments on various newer partner entities like Nervos, Orion Protocol, and Revuto. Nervos is a UTXO proof-of-work blockchain which is building a cross-chain bridge with Cardano so that you can use your ADA on Nervos dApps and vice versa. Interoperability is a big theme for Nervos and they plan to have a working testnet within a month. Orion Protocol is building a terminal that will allow for decentralized non-custodial trading across centralized and decentralized exchanges. They say this would not require you to KYC or even have an account with any of these exchanges. Revuto is an online subscription management service that recently completed a $10MM token sale on Cardano.
32. It was also revealed that Wolfram Labs, COTI, and IOHK have a three-way partnership (a ménage à tech) to build an NFT auction site. The people from Wolfram were talking about very interesting things including live minting during streaming events and automated upload to IPFS. COTI will be building out auction and bidding mechanisms in ADAPay.
33. Professor Aggelos Kiayias gave us an update on research including that Ouroboros Chronos and Hydra papers have both been accepted into conferences/journals. Chronos will provide Cardano with a global concept of time that doesn’t rely on any outside timekeeper. Prof. Kiayias also pointed out that Hydra is distinguishable from other layer two protocols in that the scripting language is identical to that of the base layer in Cardano such that any dApp that can run on Cardano will run on the Hydra L2. This is a huge plus and superior to many other layer two solutions in other ecosystems where the base layer dApps will not run on layer two. Finally, the Mithril paper has been submitted for peer review. It will provide Cardano light wallets with Succinct Non-interactive Arguments of Knowledge that will give us the best of both worlds: no delays for syncing as in full node wallets while still preserving trustlessness.
34. Finally, the Goguen Summit will be in late September. Sign up now at [summit.cardano.org](http://summit.cardano.org/).
35. The Fed is once again STRONGLY signalling to us that they are going to regulate stablecoins. The Fed is also specifically calling out Tether for the first time. You need to be thinking about how stablecoin regulation might affect your favorite Cardano DeFi or other project. [https://twitter.com/CaitlinLong\_/status/1408500265397985282](https://twitter.com/CaitlinLong_/status/1408500265397985282) [https://twitter.com/CaitlinLong\_/status/1408572624125534212](https://twitter.com/CaitlinLong_/status/1408572624125534212)
36. People are starting to realize that the Stakehound private key loss in ETH may attract unwanted regulatory attention to Ethereum 2.0 while this problem could never have occurred in Cardano. Also, only a few days later another ETH stakepool (this time SharedStake...the sixth biggest ETH Stakepool) allegedly experiences a rugpull that some are valuing at over $30MM. This is another problem that could not happen in Cardano staking. It feels like we stepped into the ring, they rang the bell, and ETH just started punching itself in the head. Eventually it’s going to KO itself.

38. John O’Connor of IOHK points out that France still controls the monetary policy of 14 countries in Africa. There is definitely a built in market on the continent for a project that delivers monetary sovereignty to the people.

51. Robert Kornacki of dcSpark releases an article on why every Cardano dApp will use NFTs. The article contains some very interesting discussion on smart contracts in the EUTXO context including language instructing that “UTXOs have smart contracts attached to them and not the other way around” and “\[...\]the simplest way to think about it is that when a UTXO is created it has the option to have a smart contract attached to it.” [https://medium.com/dcspark/every-eutxo-dapp-will-use-nfts-and-heres-why-fd87e6a8c9a6](https://medium.com/dcspark/every-eutxo-dapp-will-use-nfts-and-heres-why-fd87e6a8c9a6)

97. Notable news for upcoming Cardano DeFi projects. There may be slightly less competition in the “get a return on your crypto assets” game very soon. The New Jersey AG’s office has delivered a cease and desist letter to BlockFi. The AG’s press release cited BlockFi’s interest bearing deposit accounts as unregistered securities and also mentioned the lack of FDIC or SPIC insurance for it’s depositors. This leaves some lingering questions for Cardano DeFi projects that might be planning to accept deposits or other transfers of value and offering a return of sorts. You could argue that these projects are decentralized where BlockFi was not. But, the AG’s press release seems to cite decentralization as one of the risks of DeFi projects. Also, as a practical matter, there is a question whether decentralization will be a good shield from regulators since many of these projects have companies and real humans with faces and names behind them unlike a truly anonymous founder such as Satoshi Nakamoto.

personalfinance,Low interest rate and higher house prices Vs the opposite.,"Hello everyone! First time posting here so please bare with me as i try to get some clarity on this topic. Long story short, my brother bought a townhouse (Lets say unit #2) pre-pandemic (NOV 2019) using a VA for $335,000 with an interest rate of 3.875%. Fast forward to 2021, My wife and I are 10 days away from closing on the townhouse unit next to theirs (unit #2) also using a VA loan for $440,000 with an interest rate or 2.62%. Part of me feels like we are overpaying for this house since it was $105,000 cheaper 18-months ago but at the same time I feel like we got a good deal because of the low interest rate and the fact that the VA appraised the house at $440,000. Now don’t get me wrong, we love the house and it checks all our boxes. Im just curious to know what holds more value long term; lower interest rate and higher house prices OR higher interest rate and lower house prices.",finance

CryptoCurrency,Bank of England’s ‘Britcoin’ will drive the price of Bitcoin higher,"Britcoin, the Bank of England’s reported digital currency, rather than overtake Bitcoin, will push the cryptocurrency’s price higher, affirms the CEO of one of the world’s largest independent financial advisory, asset manager and fintech organsitions.

The comments from Nigel Green, CEO and founder of deVere Group, come after it was reported that the UK central bank is planning to launch a direct digital equivalent – dubbed ‘Britcoin’ - to physical money.

Mr Green says: “Revealing just how worried they are about the ongoing epic rise and influence of Bitcoin, and other cryptocurrencies, the Bank of England is reportedly set to establish its own digital currency - which they have previously routinely dismissed.

“If the Bank and government officials believe Britcoin will supersede Bitcoin, they are mistaken.  In fact, it will have the opposite effect.”

He continues: “It can be expected that Britcoin will push Bitcoin prices higher for three key reasons.

“First, in what will be a masterclass in the law of unintended consequences, by jumping on the bandwagon, central banks are validating the concept of Bitcoin and its inherent values of being digital, global, borderless, quicker and more cost-effective than traditional money.

“By adding further legitimacy to the market, it’s likely that innovation and development will increase, the crypto ecosystem will become even more robust, and the pace of mass adoption will be accelerated.

“Second, whilst Britcoin will have many of the plusses of Bitcoin, it will still be controlled and manipulated by the Bank of England, meaning they can adjust supply and therefore its value. With Bitcoin, there is no single authority and a progressively limited supply.

“Furthermore, in the increasingly digitalised and globalised economy, why would businesses, such as Amazon for example, in the longer-term favour a currency that is digital but not borderless in the same way as cryptocurrencies are?”

“Third, there’s a growing mistrust of the traditional bank system by the younger, ‘digital-native’ generations who are becoming the beneficiaries of the largest transfer of wealth in history as baby boomers pass on their assets.

“They’ve been influenced by the enormous surge in tech as they came into adulthood - which came around the same time as the global financial crash that hit in 2008.

“Britcoin will be controlled by a handful of people from the Bank who have conversations and make decisions behind closed doors.

“Bitcoin is controlled by no one and discussions are held out in the open and decisions are transparent and community-based. Which one do you think is the future of money?”

The UK is not the only country said to be working on plans for digital currencies. China hopes to become the first major central bank to issue a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC). The European Central Bank is exploring the launch within the next five years of a digital euro. The U.S. Federal Reserve has said it will not rush any digital dollar. This year will, however, be critical in getting the ball rolling, its chairman Jerome Powell has recently said.

The deVere CEO concludes: “The Bank of England’s reported move to set-up Britcoin highlights that digital currencies are the inevitable future of money.”",cryptocurrency

investing,Emerging markets - bit fed up with this lot.,"I'm a long-term passive buy-and-hold type of guy, and for many years I've held a small overweight in emerging markets (specifically Vanguard EM - (VFEM)).

I've never really lost faith as such in any broad-based index tracker, but I don't know, it just seems to perpetually underperform. Since 2012, VWRL is up 172% and VFEM only 59%.

My basic reasoning at the outset for having a slight overweight was that it would be these economies powering the long term future. Instead, it feels like they just continually suffer the worst combinations of natural disasters and government corruption pilfering profits.

So, I'm curious to gather views, do you still feel emerging markets are worth paying any attention to as a broad group for the long term 'boring' investor? 

Or are they only for those who want to be more active and select specific countries at specific times?

Or just dump entirely as a bad job?",finance
CryptoCurrency,"Crypto and the great depression, help me believe","so bear with me while I conduct this hypothetical analysis that is coming from someone who has an extremely limited knowledge of economics and finance.
Why do we expect cryptocurrency such as BTC, ETH, and the whole other plethora of coins to increase in value to ATH like what happened in 2017-2018?
Given the current circumstances, and recent events, I can clearly see that there is a major economical depression heading our way, and very soon. So if inflation results in a global catastrophy like what happened before, why would crypto increase in value?
How can BTC for example maintain its position? 
the only thing preventing me from investing a lot of my hard earnings is that the truth of the matter is that crypto only has value because ""some"" people believe it does, and this could change instantly, hence the fluctuations. Also, it is one thing to enjoy and appreciate the bullish runs we are seeing now, but let us say in the long term, after all us small fish have invested all our money in crypto and have fed the whales...do you think any goverment ( especially USA) would allow a cryptocurrency to replace its fiat?
I fear that the news about big companies like amazon thinking about accepting crypto is just a well planned whale feeding move, although I might be clearly wrong and seeing it from a different angle.

CryptoCurrency,"When pissed off at one bank, most people switch to a different bank now... Guess what will happen when they know how to DeFi?","If you have a bank account you know how much banks suck

- tons of paperwork
- high fees for international transfers
- in most cases, they won't let you withdraw a large sum urgently
- they are a part of the system. One word, and your funds are frozen, even until proven guilty or as political persecution
- a bank can go tits up just as easy
- zero privacy: they keep track of how you spend your money, and when shit hits the fan, your history will be used against you
- they introduce restrictions saying what you can and cannot spend your money on
- ridiculous interest rates

CryptoCurrency,"Using a ""wash sale"" can seriously reduce your taxes in a down market (U.S. only)","In the U.S. crypto is considered property, not a security. As such, it is not subject to the ""wash sale"" rule. This means you can sell a crypto asset and buy it right back within seconds/minutes to ""harvest"" a loss for use against taxes.

If crypto was considered a security like stocks, you couldn't do this as securities are subject to the wash sale rule. Under this rule, you'd have to wait a month before buying it back and claiming the loss.

**Use this if...**

* You have any crypto asset that is currently trading at a loss
* If you don't mind resetting the purchase date. In other words, resetting the 1 year clock on profits being taxed at capital gains rate vs. income rate.

Here is an example of when you might use this. You bought 1 ETH in May at $3,800. It's at $2,300 now. You also believe you won't need to divest (for profit) within 12 months. You sell it now and buy it back right now. Your paper loss becomes $1,500. This can be a tax write-off for 2021 on your federal taxes. It is not just a write-off against your crypto profits. It can offset your normal income taxes too (i.e. W2 earnings).

CryptoCurrency,A Real World Example of DYOR,"I recently posted a [Do Your Own Research Checklist](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/oqie88/do_your_own_research_checklist/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3).

I am going to walk you through my research on **Uno Re,** a coin I just researched. This post will sort of ramble, but you will see my process of doing research. The order that I list things is the order that I did them. This is not a shill for the coin that I am using. I was researching Uno Re and just made a post out of it. I had no idea what the results would be before I started.

**Does the coin have a use?** Uno Re is a reinsurance token. I am very bullish on the crypto insurance segment and think that it huge growth potential. Uno Re is the only crypto that I have discovered that is attempting to do reinsurance, that is insuring insurers. Their clients will likely be exchanges and other companies that offer insurance. **10/10**

**Is the coin being used for its use?** They list many partners on their website, including one smaller UK based non-crypto online car insurance company. They also list several “reputable” (meaning I have heard of them) crypto partnerships. *I note that their website is very fancy and slick looking. A lot of the information seems to consumer and token holder related, even though the focus of the company is companies.* ***7/10***

*I now google “Uno Crypto” with hope for a link to coinmarketcap*

**Are there other coins with the same symbol?** I see on my google results that Unobtanium is the dominate crypto with same symbol. Many people have heard of Unobtanium and Uno Re is not trying to confuse itself with Unobtanium in my opinion. This is a negative, but not a red flag in my book. **5/10**

**What chain is the coin on?** ERC-20, *I like this, but in the back of my head I think FEES for a small investment*. **10/10**

**Exchanges?** I look and see that it is on Kucoin and Uniswap. I love that it is on a real, non obscure exchange. That makes investing a small amount a lot cheaper in my book. Most coins that I research are not on a “real” exchange. *I also take a moment to look at the trading volume and it looks acceptable* **8/10**

**Number of Coins?** I se that the max coin number is **380,539,316,** but it is not showing a distributed amount. I then go to cryptorank which lists some additional information usually, if their SEO was better I would have gone to it first. Circulating supply **6,980,159**. *This can be a massive problem, this could not be a massive problem.* ***Red Flag***\*. I will investigate this as a do more research.\* **1/10**

*I then go to the IDO tab, this is not on my list, but I like the resource that crypto rank provides in this manner. I see an IDO of $0.12 for 200k/1,666,667 tokens. I see a private sale of 41,239,316 tokens at $0.06 with a 6-12 month lockup. I then scroll and see the distribution. I want to know the vesting/lockup of all the tokens. Since it listed it for the private sale, I think it is available, which is a good thing, my guess is in the white paper. I like the $0.06 private sale number. I don’t think with the vesting/unlocking they are going to tank the market below this level initially. I then click on the IDO Medium links and get error 410. WTF my brain says, why is Uno Re’s Medium account under violation for breaking Medium rules? I then realize that they have the address backwards and Uno Re does have a non-suspended, active Medium.*

*I now go to the Uno Re website*

**Are the founders and team doxxed?** Yes, I don’t do a lot of back research on them.

**White Paper?** They have an extensive white paper. It looks good, their processes make sense. They included some technicals that I wanted included and touched on some detail points that if they were just BS I didn’t think they would include (they all left out some potential details, but to include all details would take forever). *I spend extra time looking at the distribution of the tokens. All of the vesting schedules are listed, but we don’t really know when the begin. The clear release of the coins is not listed. I think that most would start in 4/21 at the earliest. 120 million of the coins are being kept in reserve for a black swan event, if they were released this would have a big negative on the price. This then puts 260MM (I’m old, MM=million) coins available, 7MM active, 42MM sold and will start to vest in a couple of months. The team’s tokens are locked for 2 years and the advisors are vested for 12 months, this is good.* **8/10, not including the coin supply issue, Coin supply issue 3/10**

*I try to find a crypto events calendar and fail (this is not a red flag and is used as more information, many cryptos aren’t listed on those sites)*

**Social Media?** They have over 50k telegram subscribers. They have a very ample twitter presence. They are running a Kucoin and Uniform promo with rather aggressive interest rates for staking. *Again, they seem to be focused on consumer awareness for their token, even though their clients are companies. They will need consumers for the back end of the system, to support the clients, so it somewhat makes sense, but still seems like a lot of effort.* ***5/10***

**Do the staking returns and ‘promos’ make sense?** *I investigate this a little more. These rewards are coming out of the Community, Incentive, and Rewards bucket and they are to drive initial adoption of the token. It is not exactly the method that I would take, but all of the pools are set time period pools and not ongoing* **5/10**

*I then research things a little bit more, looking for more info on the distribution schedule and find a Medium article written by Uno Re saying that the private sale 42MM will be unlocked August 27. This is during the staking periods, but the cost was $0.06 so there is real incentive to make it not drop below that number. I also look at the max staking caps and realize that they are decent and there might be some pumping going on with all of the staked coins if there is buying pressure, before the investor coins are released. I also discovered a graph of when all the coins were going to be released which helped explain/understand the 8MM vs 380MM red flag*\*\*\*.\*\*\* *They claim to have 2-3 years of operational expenses*

**Conclusion**

That touched on just about every point I had in the list, some I did not explicitly list, but where discovered while doing the above steps. This obviously is not a shill for Uno Re and I have not included how I would treat the coin. I approach all of my analysis where I want the coin to succeed so I get a baseline to compare them.",cryptocurrency

CryptoCurrency,Comparing Fiat and Crypto is a mistake,"So I see a lot of posts stating that USD has decreased in value over the past x years while Bitcoin has only gone up in value, and therefore USD is trash and we should just use crypto.

Now I am all for team crypto, especially as I started in Feb and I have some fine bags, but this comparison is a mistake. The term cash is trash has been around a lot longer than bitcoin, its well known its a depreciating asset. 

Its desirable for any national currency to actually have a sensible amount of inflation built in, this is to encourage people to go out and use money, either to buy stuff or invest in businesses to keep the economy going. If people could sit on there USD for 2 years and buy twice as much, why would anybody take the risk of investing, or spend money on things they don't need.

Fiat is also controllable by central banks, and countries can use monetary policy to try to give the economy a boost. If you intentionally devalue your currency you can boost your exports and help your economy out. You can also do stuff like quantitive easing to ""print"" more money, although the current practice of trying to print our way out of the covid crash is going to end badly IMO, you can paper over a small crack, but not a massive hole in the wall.

A good example of where this went wrong is in the Eurozone in 2009, countries in the EU using the euro were all bound by the same monetary policy. The rich countries didn't want to devalue because they were doing fine, the less well off countries in the south were totally stuck, and ended up with austerity, bad economies and high unemployment. Its not hard to see how this would also happen if countries flipped over to crypto.

So in summary

* Fiat is meant to be inflationary - its bad for the economy if its deflationary
* Using fiat as an investment is a bad idea
* Governments will never give up the control having there own fiat and central bank brings",cryptocurrency

defi,Took a loan out on my crypto and am having difficulty deciding what to do.,"So I took a loan out using the Celsius network for half the value of my btc with an interest rate of 8.95% APR for 6 months.

personalfinance,"How to calculate if it's worth ""buying"" extra years in my pension plan?","My pension plan calculates off your highest 5 years, averaged. It pays out 50% at 20 years of service, and an additional 2.5% for every year after that, up to 30 years for 75%. You could take the pension as a fixed amount that will never change, or as a lower option that will increase by 3% per year. I personally intend to do the 3% increase option. You also have the option to pay a lump sum into the pension fund to buy additional years of service.

For simplicity sake, let’s assume retiring in Jul 2021, with an average income of $60,000 / year, at age 39. 
This would be exactly 240 months of service, which puts me at 50% retirement. This would be:
$2500 / month fixed amount for life, or **$1742 / month with a 3% increase per year.**

I would have the option to purchase 5 extra years before I retire. I could buy up to 5 additional years of service for $19,274.00 each. Each additional year of service on my retirement adds 2.5%. So I could **spend $96,370 on buying 5 years,** and retire with 300 months of service, which would put me at 62.5%.
Based on my average income, which has remained unchanged in this calculation, I would get : 
$3125 / month fixed amount for life, or **$2177 / month with a 3% increase per year.**

This represents an increase of: 
$625 / month fixed amount for life, or **$435 / month with a 3% increase per year.** 

By my math with that 3% increase per year, it would take 15 years before I’ve recouped my original investment of $96,370. [See spreadsheet on how I came up with this number]( https://imgur.com/ugWf1Rk)

So how do I calculate this question: Is it worth spending $96,370 that will take me 15 years just to break even on, and from then on will be giving me an extra $8k~ per year, increasing by 3% a year until I die? Or would it more beneficial to do something else with that money? And the more likely question, because I don’t have $96k sitting around in the bank, is this: Is it worth taking equity out of my house, and at what interest rate, to take this deal? At what point does the cost I incur by coming up with the money to buy years outweigh the benefit I eventually get by buying years?",finance

Since I received no callback from GS yesterday, I called again today and was finally transferred to someone who let me know that because I submitted this complaint, it's been escalated higher. I expressed my frustrations around lack of communication, lack of receiving any evidence and just overall how this is being handled, and she graciously offered to call me back every day until this is resolved. I take that with a grain of salt, but good to know the CFPB complaint actually did something.**

A few weeks ago, I posted [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/AppleCard/comments/oftodx/goldman_sachs_is_saying_that_i_spent_over_900_at/) where I explain that Goldman Sachs is holding me responsible for a $930 charge that was made at an Apple store with Apple Pay, that I did not make. The three devices registered to Apple Pay were on my person in the woods in PA camping. Not near an Apple Store.

Up until now, I've never experienced LESS professional service from a major company, and this has been a complete nightmare.

The timeline thus far:

* May 30th - Transaction occurs (about) $930 at an Apple Store using Apple Pay
* June 1st - I report this transaction as fraud via the iMessage chat line. My account is credited.
* July 7 -  I receive an email saying the transaction was not resolved in my favor because ""I failed to provide additional information"". I call and explain that A. I was never contacted, and B. I can't provide information for a transaction I didn't make. The specialist looks into the history and realizes that I am correct. I was never contacted, and this is an error. They re-credit, and re-open the dispute.
* July 7 (yes, same day) - I receive an email saying the transaction was not resolved in my favor because ""the merchant already provided credit"". I call and explain the credit that was issued was by GS, and therefore not the merchant. They say sorry, we messed up and re-open the dispute &amp; credit.
* July 12 - I receive an email that once again, it was not resolved in my favor because ""the merchant provided sufficient evidence"". I ask for the evidence and to re-open the dispute. They cannot re open the dispute but instead open an investigation. My account is credited. They say they will send me the evidence via email shortly, and that an investigator will call me that week.
* July 19 -  No email is received, so I call back again to request the evidence. They say ""we don't send that via email"" and say it's currently in the mail. I wait. No contact with anyone.
* July 26 (today) - No contact,  no evidence via email or mail. I call to find out the status, and get transferred 6 times. Finally talk to someone who says the dispute is closed and they may never have actually let me know, but still sees a case open. He says he needs to transfer me to the **advocacy** department to finalize everything.I get transferred and speak to ""the highest possible manager"", who lets me know that as of right now, I could still see that charge on my card. At this point, I'm fed up and ask what I can do from here. She says she'll call me back with more info shortly, and to see if they can email me the evidence. I ask to be escalated further and she says she's basically the top person and there is nobody further. I clearly have my doubts that she'll actually reach back out to me, and she would not give me her direct line.

At this point, I don't know what to do. If the charge doesn't come back, I'll be extremely happy. But I just frankly CANNOT and WILL NOT pay $935 that I didn't actually spend - Goldman Sachs has been incredibly unprofessional with false promises - between the promise of contact &amp; getting me the evidence that's being used against me.

Where I stand: Right now, the charge isn't on the card. Depending on who I talk to on the phone, some specialists say it's over and the charge won't come back, and that there's no longer any pending disputes. Some say I should expect it on my next billing cycle and that there is a pending case still open.

If I need to keep asking them to rectify the damn case until I die to keep the money off my count, I will, I just refuse to pay close to $1000 that clearly went into someone else's pocket. I want to close this card and be forever done with it but don't want to risk something going to collections and potentially harming my excellent credit score. The incompetency on their part is astonishing.

ethereum,Digging into how will EIP-1559 affect MEV,"It's no secret that many mining pools haven't been fans of **EIP-1559**, primarily the fee burning aspect to it. But how will EIP-1559 affect **MEV**, another large source of revenue for miners? Our very own [Kristof Gazso](https://twitter.com/kristofgazso)  from **Nethermind** &amp; **Flashbot**'s [Alejo Salles](https://twitter.com/fiiiu_) explored this in a recent paper they co-wrote together.

So, how do they make up for that loss of revenue? We explored two potential ways: mandatory base fee, these transactions that are stuffed onto blocks are no longer possible. One of the changes that will occur is that miner revenues will fall as a result of this change (part of why they opposed the change). Luckily, a simplistic analysis indicates that the majority of hash power (98%) will stay with ETH, despite EIP-1559.

So, how do they make up for that lost of revenue? We explored two potential ways:

* extracting more MEV
* artificially limiting block sizes

They might lean more into extracting more MEV.

One of these effects is miners stuffing blocks with bundles versus normal transactions, especially since these MEV bundles are generally more profitable than normal transactions. The caveat for this attack is that each bundle needs to be more profitable than the normal transaction, and as a result, we shouldn't expect blocks filled with only bundles.Next, miners could coordinate to keep the block sizes to the point where the basefee is 0, forcing users to pay higher priority fees to miners, undermining the benefits of 1559.

Because of the high uptake of MEV-geth (85% of Ethereum's hash rate), could this allow miners to collude passively? It would require all the miners to collude with no miner being selfish (among other assumptions) and is highly unlikely.

Flashbots team is clearly against of introducing such changes but how about miners changing the code? It's no secret that many mining pools haven't been fans of EIP-1559, primarily the fee-burning aspect to it. But how will EIP-1559 affect MEV, another large source of revenue for miners?

Make sure to check out the MEV and EIP-1559 paper: [https://hackmd.io/@flashbots/MEV-1559](https://hackmd.io/@flashbots/MEV-1559), which goes into more detail!

CryptoCurrency,"The Hemp Blockchain, Inc. Chooses Algorand as Its Blockchain Platform","SALT LAKE CITY -- The Hemp Blockchain, Inc., the company building advanced cloud-based solutions to accelerate the growth of the industrial hemp industry, today announced the selection of Algorand as its blockchain platform to support a range of supply chain management and marketplace solutions purpose-built for the industrial hemp industry. The Hemp Blockchain™ seeks to “leapfrog” existing solutions in an agriculture sector with significant growth prospects that is strategically important for multiple reasons, including agricultural sustainability, carbon sequestration and the rapidly increasing need for carbon offset credits.

Algorand Inc. built the world’s first open source, permissionless, pure proof-of-stake blockchain protocol for the next generation of financial products. This blockchain, the Algorand protocol, is the brainchild of Turing Award-winning cryptographer Silvio Micali. Algorand is a leader in proof-of-stake consensus mechanisms used to validate transactions on blockchain networks. Among the advantages of proof-of-stake over proof-of-work, the other major blockchain consensus mechanism, are its scalability and energy efficiency, as it does not utilize competing high resource consuming “miners” to validate transactions. As a result, Algorand is a natural choice for companies such as The Hemp Blockchain dedicated to helping to achieve a net-zero carbon future.

Industrial hemp is a rapidly growing industry driven by a separate crop from its biological relatives that produce THC-based cannabis products as it contains less than 0.3% THC by dry weight. Industrial hemp can be processed into over 50,000 uses, including fuels, plastics, graphene, solvents, building materials, foods, and medicines, and is also a powerful tool in the global effort to combat climate change because an acre of hemp can potentially sequester as much or more carbon as an acre of rainforest.

Currently, the industrial hemp supply chain is in a state of disarray. It is characterized by opacity, fragmentation, lack of reliable payment systems, the inability to verify “real” buyers and sellers, and the inability to reliably and consistently verify seed genetics for product provenance and quality according to federal and state regulatory requirements. Owing to its relative immaturity, the industrial hemp industry is underserved by a supply-chain solution targeting its needs, creating favorable conditions for market entry and long-term success of a modern, industry-focused solution that is blockchain-native. Furthermore, by introducing a streamlined carbon offset credit marketplace that includes a reliable token to mediate commerce, The Hemp Blockchain will offer value well beyond that of traditional approaches.

“We are partnering with world-class technology firms and domain experts to help build and support our platform while giving us the ability to scale and operate globally,” said Dan Higbee, President and CEO of The Hemp Blockchain, Inc. “Technology serves its highest purpose when it materially improves the lives of people. The Hemp Blockchain will provide a trusted digital infrastructure that benefits not only those that grow and process hemp, but also consumers of its vast array of end products, and perhaps most importantly, the planet as a whole by accelerating carbon sequestration. Industrial Hemp farmers can literally grow Carbon credits from the earth, for the earth…™ with The Hemp Blockchain and The Carbon Protocol™.”

“We are excited about the continued expansion of the community building on Algorand and welcome The Hemp Blockchain to the Algorand ecosystem. We have been focused since the beginning on creating the most advanced technology that will allow organizations at the forefront of technology adoption, like The Hemp Blockchain™, to build and deploy new blockchain-based applications that will remove friction from legacy business models,” said David Markley, Director Business Solutions at Algorand.

About Algorand
Algorand is building the technology to power the Future of Finance (FutureFi), the convergence of traditional and decentralized models into a unified system that is inclusive, frictionless, and secure. Founded by Turing Award-winning cryptographer Silvio Micali, Algorand developed a blockchain infrastructure that offers the interoperability and capacity to handle the volume of transactions needed for defi, financial institutions and governments to smoothly transition into FutureFi. The technology of choice for more than 500 global organizations, Algorand is enabling the simple creation of next generation financial products, protocols and exchange of value.

hardware,"I have a Framework DIY Edition, AMA","Here's some pics of it and a timelapse of assembly: https://www.reddit.com/r/framework/comments/orrctp/unboxing_pictures_and_a_timelapse_of_my_sister/

Why did I buy one: 


Honestly I'm not a huge right to repair fanatic(I watched some Louis Rossman videos and I honestly was kinda bored with his shtick🤣)  but I am a big DIY'er; I've been building my own computers for a long time!

What impressed me the most from when they out of stealth was the level of polish that the whole project had...I could  tell from the pictures that they had on their website and their IG that they were not a fly by night operation; they had a real product that they fully intended to bring to production(given the pictures of the ODM factory making the pre production units) and they had the staff(especially with the supply chain skills!)  necessary to make that a reality. 

As such, given that my Broadwell Alienware 13 was getting pretty long in the tooth, I was more than willing to their passion and dedication  with a preorder especially considering that I was considering replacing it with an XPS 13 

The Preorder experience:


After seeing a post on their IG that they opened their preorders, and after playing F5 bingo I was able to get a preorder for a DIY i7-1165G7, an AX210 wifi card , 4 USB C , 1 USB A, 1 HDMI 2.0 expansion cards and a power adapter for shipment in ""late july"". I ordered a WD SN850 500gb, 32gb of DDR4-3200  and a copy of windows separately.  

They kept me updated throughout the wait from May to July with multiple emails and posts on their blog but I have to say I was ecstatic when they posted  on their IG in early July that they were doing a production run and that everything was on schedule! 

They sent 2 more emails after that, one to confirm that all the information on file was correct, and one a week later (as  they promised!) notifying me that they had charged  my card because my order was on the way! 

Around that time I got the charge email they posted an IG story showing the first unit going to a customer, and I got a Fedex shipment nofication!

Even pre covid, I can't remember the last time a hardware startup was this good at the delivery stage of their product, so I was pretty happy to see everything go so well. 


First impressions: 


There are plenty of other press outlets that have done better photoshoots of the laptop than I did so I will leave you with my impressions: 
- For benchmarks: My DIY edition is configured pretty similarly to the unit that [NotebookCheck](https://www.notebookcheck.net/Framework-Laptop-13-5-Review-If-Microsoft-Made-A-Repairable-Surface-Laptop-This-Would-Be-It.551850.0.html)  got, except I have 2 sticks of the same RAM and the 500GB model of the same SSD 
- NotebookCheck's comment about the fan getting loud at load is true, and surprised me at first, but at least it doesn't stay at that speed for very long 
- The box is very nice looking! 
- There's a [webpage](https://knowledgebase.frame.work/en_us/how-do-i-download-drivers-for-my-framework-laptop-SyHOJGwCu) with the drivers that W10 21H1 doesn't have in the image, I spent too much time waiting for Snappy Driver Installer to download a bunch of drivers 🤣 
- In general I agree with Monica Chin's (the Verge) review; the camera is great(on par with the no name 1080p webcams if not better, but not as good as a Logitech C920), the keyboard is good(although I prefer my Logitech MX Keys in terms of membrane keyboards), there's a similar amount of flex as the more repairable options (I had a EliteBook 830 G7 from work for a couple of months, [the 840 is similar](https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/HP+EliteBook+840+G6+Repairability+Assessment/124318) ) in the segment but the laptop itself doesn't have any exceptional quantitative  qualities and that you're buying it in hope that the company stays around. 


Final thoughts: 


In one sense, the Framework having  average specs is a victory as Nirav Patel stated that he wanted the laptop to be modular and repairable without sacrificing on battery life and performance.

It's refreshing to have preordered a hardware startup's product and it meets their promises for the product and is delivered on time, and while I am hopeful that they'll stay around for the long term, at worst I'll have a very repairable computer that I'll be able to use for a long time!

Bitcoin,My mom sold all her Bitcoin,"I(27M) got my mother(65F) into Bitcoin in Q3 of 2020. After some time in crypto, and esp the covid dip I figured it was time to share Bitcoin with my very traditional and financially conservative, immigrant parents. 

I set up my mother up with the BTC in cashapp( I started her off really simplistic to avoid mishaps and confusion) and I shared the gameplan with my her it was simple. We were going to buy and hold with an emphasis on DCA. In times of price horizontal development (like what we’ve been seeing for the past 2 months) we would be aggressive with with out DCA-ing. 

Frankly, my dad(57M)has never understood nor has ever cared to understand the world of finance and investing. He was always in her ear with negative comments and opinions. We had an opportunity to have a big win out of the 2008 housing crisis and he shot that plan down too. 

My mom is enjoying retirement while my dad has served his time in the union and keeps pushing retirement back because all he knows is work. They have money in the bank so any money btc was making could have simply just stayed there til we felt it was time to lock in some gains.

This past Saturday(7/24) all the comments and nagging had pushed my mom over the edge. In order to get him to finally shut up, she sold all the BTC he had accumulated this past year. I don’t think she will ever get back into the Bitcoin.

She called me this morning raving about btc hitting 40k off the amazing catalyst and how she’s shouldn’t have listened to my dad. I was frustrated all weekend after she told me what she had done and honestly didn’t want to talk to her about Bitcoin anymore.

I feel frustrated. Not really sure how I should feel to be honest. A bit fed up with my dad and his outdated perspectives. 

Anyone else experience this? Do I just let it be and keep focused on my journey?",cryptocurrency
stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Monday, July 26, 2021","**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, July 26, 2021**

The stock market carried on its momentum from last week, with all three major indexes (S&amp;P 500 (SPY), Nasdaq (QQQ), and Dow Jones (DIA)) powering to new record highs despite last Monday’s steep decline, a sign that market participants remain eager and able to buy up any dips in the broader market. It seems market participants continue to weigh a variety of factors, including but not limited to: (1) faster-than-expected pace of economic recovery, (2) surging corporate earnings, (3) potential inflationary pressures, (4) labor market imbalances, and (5) concerns surrounding the coronavirus Delta variant. Basically, the market is balancing between expectations for rapid economic expansion moving forward and concerns surrounding inflation and the Delta variant.

Over the last several weeks, market participants have been gauging the likelihood that the spread of highly contagious coronavirus Delta-variant could begin to pressure the ongoing economic recovery in the US. Last week, concerns came to a head after several local counties in the US, including Los Angeles, re-implemented the mask mandate in order to try and curb the spread.  In the US, despite roughly 50% of the population being vaccinated, in the past two weeks, infections across the country have roughly doubled, with new cases jumping from 13,200 on July 4 to 51,939 on July 25, according to data compiled by John Hopkins University. 

However, it is important to understand that the rising infections are broadly concentrated in areas with higher vaccine hesitancy. According to data from the CDC, 97% of people who have died or been hospitalized with COVID-19 since the vaccine became widely available are unvaccinated. Dr Rochelle Walensky, Director of CDC said of the rising cases, “There is a clear message that is coming through. This is becoming a pandemic of the unvaccinated. Our biggest concern is we are going to continue to see preventable cases, hospitalizations, and sadly deaths among the unvaccinated.” Sadly, despite the widespread availability of the vaccine in the US, hesitancy in certain places remains very high.

David Kostin, US Equity Strategist at Goldman Sachs said, “We \[Goldman Sachs\] think the Delta variant should pose a minimal risk to the US equity market. From an economic perspective, widespread vaccinations and strategies focused on containment suggest limited medical and economic downside even if infections continue to rise. From a flows perspective, robust household cash balances and corporate buyback authorizations should continue to support inflows for equities, increasing the likelihood that market participants perceive a pullback as a buying opportunity”

Later this week, investors will hear from Federal Reserve officials over the path forward for monetary policy, which will likely be informed by the increased concerns over the Delta variant and peaking economic growth rates. Analysts are predicting that the downside risks still present in the economy will continue to overshadow potential worries over inflation, which means members of the Fed are very unlikely to make any changes in the upcoming meeting. What I am most interested in from these meetings is hearing about a potential timeline to begin tapering quantitative easing (QE). I expect the Fed will make some kind of announcement regarding this before the year ends. The real test for equities is coming in 2023, when the interest rate is expected to begin rising.

Q2 earnings season is shaping up to be another record-breaking quarter, with corporate earnings continuing to be super-charged by higher than expected demand from savings-laden consumers. So far, 24% of the companies in the SPY have reported, and of these, 88% have so far topped analyst estimates, according to FactSet. 

**Highlights**

* As I was writing the recap, Tesla beat earning estimates, recording revenue of $11.96 billion, better than the $11.3 billion expected and up from $6.04 billion a year earlier. 
* Shares of Chinese stocks remain under heavy pressure, with investors spooked by the latest actions of the Chinese government. This comes after the CCP hammered ride-hailing company Didi, whose stock is more than 40% below IPO price after the CCP threatened to slap them with a record fine and pull the stock from US listing. Moreover, the CCP is forcing private-education companies into becoming nonprofits in an effort to lower the cost of education. 
* This week a lot of mega-cap tech stocks are reporting earnings, with Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Facebook (FB), and Microsoft (MSFT) set to report this week. 
* Bank of America (BAC) has announced that it will be increasing its dividend on the 24th of September to US$0.21. This takes the annual payment to 2.0% of the current stock price, which is about average for the industry. 
* **\*\*Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing price\*\***
* Amazon (AMZN) target raised by Credit Suisse from $4000 to $4850 at Outperform. Stock currently around $3695
* Celanese (CE) with two target raises. Stock currently around $154
   * Wells Fargo from $183 to $186 at Overweight

Should I wait until September, put down extra money (5k), and then refinance, or just refinance ASAP? Not familiar with earnest but heard some good things about them.

personalfinance,Relative holding our mortgage,"My wife and I are in the process of building a house. Yes, the timing is terrible, but we started this process a long time ago and we're forging forward. Her uncle has offered to lend us the money when the construction loan is converted to a traditional mortgage. On the surface, this seems like an amazing opportunity for us and is extremely generous of him. Obviously there are some huge advantages in terms of the interest rate since he said he'll use the lowest rate allowed by law. We plan on getting it drafted by an attorney and making it as cut and dry as possible. Are there any other advantages I'm not thinking or or any red flags I need to be aware of? One of my concerns is what will happen to the mortgage when he passes away. He's 70 and doesn't have any kids of his own. My wife is the executer of his estate, so when he passes what is going to happen to this mortgage? This is likely the largest purchase I will ever make in my life so I'm pretty nervous as I've always heard that you shouldn't mix family and business.",finance
personalfinance,Student Loans: Any cons that I am missing with the federal extended repayment plan?,"With the federal student loan forbearance period set to end in September, I am trying to figure out my best plan for paying back my loans.  One thing I have been consider is switching from the 10-yr standard level repayment plan to the 25-yr extended repayment plan. This would drop my minimum monthly payment from $780 to under $500. I have been paying about $1,000 a month on these loans, and plan on paying near that much if I switched plans. The reason for wanting to switch is to eventually step down payments (below $780) to have more money to put towards other savings goals, such as a house. I know one big con for the extended plan is the larger amount of interest to pay over the life of the loan, but I have figured that with my lump sum payment I plan on making once forbearance ends + diligently maintaining a $100 payment monthly (initially), the amount of interest that will be paid over the life of the loan will be manageable. 

My issue right now is seeing my current minimum payment at $780 and knowing that I have to pay that much each month over the life of the loans. Whereas if I switched to the extended plan, then I could still make my large, above minimum payment, but could step down my minimum payments as more of the loan is paid off. Am I missing anything here with the federal loan extended repayment plan?",finance

personalfinance,Student loan Interest Rates,"As I’m nearing the end of my student loan payments (yay!) I decided to try and figure out how much I paid in interest relative to the principal amount borrowed. I was very surprised to learn I paid a little over 10% of the principal in interest and I’m scratching my head a little on this. 

The back story: 
I borrowed $45,127.12 to consolidate my loans and obtain a lower rate. That rate was 3.95% fixed. My first payment of $840/mo started on Feb 6, 2017. I’ve paid $840/mo every month since then. This would be 54 payments completed so date (July 2021). I have $4,329.84 left on the remaining 5-6 months so there will still be a little more interest I’m sure but I want to make sure my math checks out based off these numbers… 

To date I have paid $45,360 ($840 x 54) + 4,329.84 (still to be paid) = $49,689.84 

This would mean I paid $4,562.72 ($49,689.84 - 45,127.12)(assuming no more interest from here on out). So 4,562.72/45,127.12 = .1011 or 10.11%. 

Did I do all this math correctly? Obviously 10.11% is a lot more than 3.95% and I’m thinking this is because the loan interest rate is APR meaning it’s 3.95% on any remaining balance per year? That’s the only thing I can think of. 

This is highly deceiving in my opinion. I can only imagine what an 8% loan spread out over 10 yrs for example would look like in ACTUAL interest payments/percentage rate of principal. I think consumer protections should use APR AND total rate over life of loan to give someone a truer picture of how much it really costs to borrow that money. 

Please let me know if there are any flaws in my logic or process here. Thoughts on interest rates and how they’re presented are also welcomed! Thanks for listening!",finance
personalfinance,What to do with down payment cash?,"Hello all,

My fiancé (26f) and I (26m) have been looking for a house since January. We are moving states to be closer to home and have been living with her parents in the meantime. She is able to work remotely @ her previous role indefinitely (not that it matters, but the company is 50% remote employees so there is no risk of them taking that away from her.) I just took a job that pays double what I was making out of state. Because of this, we have went from very little in the bank to $50k in savings. Our current monthly income has us looking in the $400k range for homes so we have 10% down and some left over to fill the house with furniture as we are coming from a one bedroom apartment. We are also effectively debt free, no student loans. The only debt either of us currently carries is my monthly car payments which is at a 0% interest rate to a relatively small balance on a 0% intro APR credit card for the ring that I bought. We also have a combined $40k in retirement savings through various accounts across work and personal contributions. Additionally, we make about $1k a month from a side gig that we started in November.

With the financial background out of the way, my question is, should we be putting some of that down payment money in something that could earn us more than the 0.5% APY that our savings account pays? Considering we could need the cash in a month, are there any safe suggestions that we could take advantage of? 

Any thoughts are greatly welcome.",finance

personalfinance,Should I remove a family member from my cars title or just keep them on it?,"A family member co-signed on a car with me.  I didn't need them too but with them co-signing I was able to help them build *their* credit and it also got me a better interest rate on the loan.

Fast forward to the present and now the car is paid off.  I recently received the title in the mail.  On the title it says that the owner is 'Me or Them' and not 'Me and Them'.

The family member and I are on fantastic terms.  There is no ill-intent or hostility between us at all.  The family member is completely okay with being removed from the title as they are in acknowledgment that the vehicle does not belong to them.

Is there a reason why I should or shouldn't remove them from the title?  If they get into financial trouble down the road (car pun), and for example acquire a lean against them, could my vehicle be caught up in their debts?

personalfinance,Financial Plan for Part-Time MBA?,"I'm trying to think through my finances for a part-time MBA.

I'm currently making a salary of 160k a year in tech. I have a net worth of around \~300k.

I am thinking of doing a part-time MBA which would cost 150k over 3 years. I am aiming to switch up my job to a higher paying one (200k-250k) sometime during the program. I'm currently in the target role and when I look on [levels.fyi](https://levels.fyi) this seems like a reasonable salary range to aim for next. Besides the job/salary aspect, I'm also hoping to attend for other life/social/academic reasons.

My financial plan is to pay for part of the MBA out of pocket while I attend. My rent is 2600/month. I would contribute maybe 1500-2000/month to MBA costs, in order to reduce my loans. For example, I would aim to pay 18k to 24k per year (54k to 72k total), and bring down my total loans from 150k to 78k to 96k by the end.

Questions:

1. Does this seem financially feasible? I feel nervous about taking on loans even though I have a plan that seems feasible? 
2. Does it seem better to pay for part of the MBA as I go to reduce loans?
3. Is it better to get federal or private loans? Federal would be the Direct Unsubsidized Loan and the Graduate Plus Loan.
4. Should I continue contributing to my 401k while I go or prioritize paying for school as I go?

Thanks for the help in advance.",finance

CryptoCurrency,"The Post-Pandemic's Upcoming Economic Fallout On Fiat, And How Will Benefit Cryptocurrencies: A Case Study On USD","# ABTRACT 

The Pandemic has put many countries, including the United States, into economic turmoil. To stay afloat the rapids of the stacking debt from COVID-19, healthcare and reduced GDP productivity, many of these countries have resorted to heavy money-printing. However, due to the Pandemic's stay-at-home and reduced economical 'exchange' profile, cash isn't flowing around fast enough. This loss in monetary velocity nullifies and backs up the ongoing inflations' effect, and just like a dam filling up with water, it will burst very, very soon. The resulting aftermath of pent up inflation will severely damage both fiat value and trust. Although speculative, crypto among other assets will be quick to lap up the demand. 

**ELI5 ABTRACT**

The Pandemic forced Fed to print crazy amounts of money. Since Pandemic also reduced money exchange rate, this reduced 'monetary velocity' is holding back a huge inflation wave. The aftermath will cause fiat to go down, and the resulting power gap could benefit assets like crypto. 

# ECONOMIC REASONING

**Significant Money Printing**

Between February and December of 2020, nearly 35% of all US dollars in existence were printed. (Choros, 2020) (Fig. 1). 

&amp;#x200B;

[Fig. 1, a graph tracking the circulating dollars printed by the US Feds. Notice the massive spike in printing as the Pandemic rolled around in early 2020 \(Source: FRED Economic Data, 2021b, as cited in Choros, 2020\).](https://preview.redd.it/lchuferqgod71.png?width=1158&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4ebb8b58fabaff52db42a86e0644322519c18156)

**Low Monetary Velocity**

Since the Pandemic had started, stay-at-home orders combined with the lack of foreign money exchange (i.e. tourism) and lack of purchasing due to COVID-19 has caused a dramatic reduction in US money velocity, which is the speed at which money exchanges hands. Shown in Fig. 2, the velocity has dipped quite a bit, which 'localizes' the effects of the increased inflation caused by 2020's economic impact. If less hands exchange the newly printed dollars, the less widespread the overall effect will be. This is why *for now*, consumer goods' prices for example haven't jumped 35%, although there is still minor impact. 

&amp;#x200B;

[Fig. 2, a graph tracking the monetary velocity of the US dollar \(Source: FRED Economic Data, 2021a\). ](https://preview.redd.it/7rebms6wiod71.png?width=1163&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=719b47c5037dfe9349b796e9e5c8dabab5444e2f)

However, as vaccinations go up and COVID-19 cases go down, more and more businesses are eager to open their doors, and well as shoppers and tourists ready to travel around and purchase things. This will release the dam previously holding back the aforementioned 35%+ cash printed inflation in *2020 alone*, because as more hands circulate the money, will inflation have the chance to distribute over the wider population. 

# THE AFTERMATH

We cannot predict how bad the effects will be, but only estimate the damages. Both trust and value in fiat will diminish substantially, providing more room and popularity needed to grow cryptocurrencies for example, as an industry. I'll give it up to your imagination to what this would mean for your portfolio. 

Of course, especially small businesses and those unfortunate on the socioeconomic scale will suffer the most, and there isn't much we can do to stop it, sadly. 

The feds aren't working diligently on a matter that involves global economy. There have since been only *considerations* put into this problem. To quote Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, ""inflation, though elevated, will likely be moderate"". Compare that to the numbers I just showed you, c'mon, really? 

# TO CONCLUDE

This is something serious to consider as you invest in both cryptocurrencies and other assets like real estate and stocks. Please do your due diligence before considering any financial moves, especially under this situational umbrella. Inflation is usually something to consider in market trends, but under especially unique circumstances, should it be regarded with the upmost care. 

Cheers to that bombshell! :)

3. The regulatory purge of stablecoins is getting into full swing now with Bloomberg running a piece on a DOJ criminal probe of the Tether founders.  Of particular note for the Cardano ecosystem is that the first attack surface for regulators is the relationship of the stablecoin with legacy banking institutions. This is something that Cardano ecosystem stablecoin, Djed, may already fix with its own crypto backed reserve system.

6. President of Tanzania calls on the central bank to prepare for the adoption of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. I wonder what crypto ecosystem already has experience working with an African government on a big crypto project and has partnered with a mobile company that is already bringing connectivity to rural Tanzania?

18. It looks like the second biggest ETH stakepool or it's custody provider has lost it’s users private keys to $75MM in ETH. Cardano doesn’t have this problem. We get to keep custody of our crypto because we found a better way than slashing.

20. COTI (a project with very close ties to Cardano) is coming to Ledger. [https://medium.com/cotinetwork/coti-native-is-coming-to-ledger-c56b04df1253](https://medium.com/cotinetwork/coti-native-is-coming-to-ledger-c56b04df1253)
21. The June Cardano 360 is currently available on Youtube. [https://youtu.be/al5m14299ww](https://youtu.be/al5m14299ww)
22. We saw segments on various newer partner entities like Nervos, Orion Protocol, and Revuto. Nervos is a UTXO proof-of-work blockchain which is building a cross-chain bridge with Cardano so that you can use your ADA on Nervos dApps and vice versa. Interoperability is a big theme for Nervos and they plan to have a working testnet within a month. Orion Protocol is building a terminal that will allow for decentralized non-custodial trading across centralized and decentralized exchanges. They say this would not require you to KYC or even have an account with any of these exchanges. Revuto is an online subscription management service that recently completed a $10MM token sale on Cardano.
23. It was also revealed that Wolfram Labs, COTI, and IOHK have a three-way partnership (a ménage à tech) to build an NFT auction site. The people from Wolfram were talking about very interesting things including live minting during streaming events and automated upload to IPFS. COTI will be building out auction and bidding mechanisms in ADAPay.
24. Professor Aggelos Kiayias gave us an update on research including that Ouroboros Chronos and Hydra papers have both been accepted into conferences/journals. Chronos will provide Cardano with a global concept of time that doesn’t rely on any outside timekeeper. Prof. Kiayias also pointed out that Hydra is distinguishable from other layer two protocols in that the scripting language is identical to that of the base layer in Cardano such that any dApp that can run on Cardano will run on the Hydra L2. This is a huge plus and superior to many other layer two solutions in other ecosystems where the base layer dApps will not run on layer two. Finally, the Mithril paper has been submitted for peer review. It will provide Cardano light wallets with Succinct Non-interactive Arguments of Knowledge that will give us the best of both worlds: no delays for syncing as in full node wallets while still preserving trustlessness.
25. Finally, the Goguen Summit will be in late September. Sign up now at [summit.cardano.org](http://summit.cardano.org/).
26. The Fed is once again STRONGLY signalling to us that they are going to regulate stablecoins. The Fed is also specifically calling out Tether for the first time. You need to be thinking about how stablecoin regulation might affect your favorite Cardano DeFi or other project. [https://twitter.com/CaitlinLong\_/status/1408500265397985282](https://twitter.com/CaitlinLong_/status/1408500265397985282) [https://twitter.com/CaitlinLong\_/status/1408572624125534212](https://twitter.com/CaitlinLong_/status/1408572624125534212)
27. People are starting to realize that the Stakehound private key loss in ETH may attract unwanted regulatory attention to Ethereum 2.0 while this problem could never have occurred in Cardano. Also, only a few days later another ETH stakepool (this time SharedStake...the sixth biggest ETH Stakepool) allegedly experiences a rugpull that some are valuing at over $30MM. This is another problem that could not happen in Cardano staking. It feels like we stepped into the ring, they rang the bell, and ETH just started punching itself in the head. Eventually it’s going to KO itself.

The El Faro article reporting meetings between Cardano, Whizgrid of Cyprus, and the brothers of President Bukele of El Salvador definitely contain some extremely interesting details related to a possible Salvadorean national stablecoin by the end of the year and a possible digitization and blockchain storage of a wide range of government related documents next year.

88. Notable news for upcoming Cardano DeFi projects. There may be slightly less competition in the “get a return on your crypto assets” game very soon. The New Jersey AG’s office has delivered a cease and desist letter to BlockFi. The AG’s press release cited BlockFi’s interest bearing deposit accounts as unregistered securities and also mentioned the lack of FDIC or SPIC insurance for it’s depositors. This leaves some lingering questions for Cardano DeFi projects that might be planning to accept deposits or other transfers of value and offering a return of sorts. You could argue that these projects are decentralized where BlockFi was not. But, the AG’s press release seems to cite decentralization as one of the risks of DeFi projects. Also, as a practical matter, there is a question whether decentralization will be a good shield from regulators since many of these projects have companies and real humans with faces and names behind them unlike a truly anonymous founder such as Satoshi Nakamoto.

I graduated highschool and followed an athletic career to a division 1 college without a scholarship. I was eagerly striving to get one so that I didn’t have to rack up debt. Obviously, things didn’t turn out the way I had hoped. Long story short, I ended up about 50k in debt with only an associates degree. 18 year old me fucked up, big time. 

I’m currently 23 have about 40k $ in total with 20k of it being in savings. Around ~1 in checkings. And ~20k more in stocks and crypto currencies. 

I’ve been out of school for about 6 months now and am going to have to start paying my student loans. However, with Sallie Mae, my interest rate is about 11% which is absolutely disgusting. My plan is to pay off around 10k and refinance with a company that will pull me down to about 4% interest and consolidate the 5 different loans I have under Sallie Mae in to one loan. With this company I will be paying ~$500 a month for 15 years; gross. 

I currently make about 3k a month and live at home where I pay $400 a month. I have no other expenses. My goal is to be debt free by 30 and I have worked hard to save up this far. 

Is this the right step? Should I consider something else? Please help relieve my anxiety about this.",finance
CryptoCurrency,"History doesn't always repeat itself, but..","..check out these three graphs:

https://u.cubeupload.com/Wpr/2013.png

Look at the Bitcoin peak in 2013, after which people said crypto is now dead; whales manipulated the price, cashed out, and crypto is now dead forever.

Look at the Bitcoin peak in 2017, making the peak in 2013 look like a peak for ants. The 2013 peak got dwarfed. Lots of media attention around this general crypto peak. After that the price fell, people had high hopes for it to return to ATH but around the end of 2018 many people gave up. Crypto was now officially dead. Whales cashed out and there was no way for crypto to come back to ATH.

Look at the Bitcoin peak in 2017, making the 2013 peak look like a flat line. And also dwarfing the 2017 peak, now making that one look like a peak for ants. 

The price then fell, but look at where we still are! Will history repeat itself? Will the 2021 peak in the future look like a boring flat line?",cryptocurrency

financialindependence,$1mm NW at 29 Software Sales FIRE Journey,"Wanted to share my journey to FIRE and long term plans in case anyone else was curious about options to hit FI fast or FatFIRE without becoming an engineer, lawyer, or going FAANG.  For the majority of my career I’ve worked in software as a service (SaaS) sales.  Jumped around a few times and consistently over performed by working long hours, leveraging my team’s resources to multiply my work, and getting more gray hair than any of my same aged peers. 

Lost my job in December after some management changes, took a sabbatical for 4 months, and started a new one about 4 months ago.  Last gig was mid-market sales and I was driven to be the top rep.  There was a very quarterly driven cadence and I much preferred to work major deals or ones that would feed me in the future.  I succeeded, getting rep of the year in 2019, #1 out of 140 with $6mm in total contract value.  Then I was fired 8 months later for performance. My 2020 numbers slipped with COVID, what have you done for me lately?

The sabbatical put everything into perspective.  Rise and grind is a toxic attitude and taking time away from sales culture made me realize I was addicted to working.  Sales glorifies folks working on their days off, going to ridiculous lengths to close a deal, and spending your money as soon as you get it.  Stories available by request for each.  As the saying goes, a sales manager loves when his reps have a baby, a luxury car payment, and an addiction.  Taking time off then working from home to get away from it made me like myself more as a person.  That said, Sales is absolutely the right career move to get to FIRE as fast as possible without investing years to learn a new skill like coding.  I don’t regret it. 

Now taking a much more laid back approach to work since I realized the stress wasn’t worth it.   New job is Enterprise sales and much more long-term focused.  While the accounts are bigger and the problems more complex, it’s much easier for me to deep dive learn the business of a handful of companies than dozens.  

I can make $400k+ grinding 60+ hours per week including Sundays, riding around in Ubers 7am-8pm for face to face meetings, drinks, and dinners, or I can make $250k-$350k doing it from home starting at 8, cutting out at 5pm (3 on Fridays), going to the gym, and getting a good night sleep.  Competing to be a top performer is stressful.  Chilling out and helping people with the problems they’re explicitly trying to solve is not.  


**Goals**

Retire at 32 so my partner can take an international job which moves around every 2 years and I can get promoted to trophy husband.  I’d like to get to $1.6mm before then, but I’d be ok with doing FIREing at $1.3mm since housing will be taken care of by her gig.  Game plan is to find a fun job to keep me busy 10-20 hours per week, get more serious about a hobby like writing or cooking, or volunteer.  

**My Story**

**2014: Income - $30k.  Assets at EoY - $5k. Spent - Unknown.  Debt - $30k**

Graduated from an instate undergrad in 2013 with $30k of debt. Spent 5 months looking for a job, eventually landed at a branch of a bank opening business bank accounts ,credit cards, etc. Started mid-year at a salary of $45k + Bonus.  Pretty much treading water

**2015: Income - $60k.  Assets at EoY - $10k.  Spent - $36k.  Debt - $20k**

Small raise, left the bank, joined a software company selling data software.  Technical proficiency was a big part of the role and I had a background in statistics from my undergrad, but had to learn the basics of selling over the phone B2B.  Salary of $45k with an on target earnings (OTE) of $76k.  


**2016: Income - $115k  Assets at EoY - $50k.  Spent - $35k.  Debt - $0**

Small raise, but commission really made a big difference.  Used 1 commission check to pay off all of my remaining student debt.  Ended up getting top rep of 120, maxing out my 401k, ESPP, Roth IRA, and getting a few RSUs.  


**2017: Income - $140k.  Assets at EoY - $130k.  Spent - $38k**

New job at a Series A startup with the promise of a $365k OTE and a base of $100k.  Dun goofed, this was not the right spot and I ended up hating it.  After struggling for multiple months I got saddled with the Christian Right Wing vertical where I found a ton of success despite being an LGBT atheist Democrat (political software).  Out of the 16 people I started with in Sales only 7 hadn’t been fired by the CEO or left because they were morally against what the company was doing.  After 2 bosses got fired, the Controller delaying commission checks because “I think you sales people get paid too much,” and having to do deal reviews with an operations director who had no experience selling I knew my time was over here.  Learned not to work at super early stage startups and all the weird rules of back door IRAs.

**2018: Income - $160k.  Assets at EoY - $234k.  Spent - $40.5k**

New job at a best in breed company.  In my first year win a few accolades, speak at our annual kick off conference, and building a solid book of business for next year.  New company offers a mega backdoor 401k, start maxing it out along with the above.  


**2019: Income - $415k.  Assets at EoY - $606k*.  Spent: $42.5k**

Things come together.  Close my first $1mm+ deal, then closed another one 8 months later.  Tons of accolades, talks of big promotions, and lots of prestige.  My partner started grad school so my rent went up significantly.

* I think this number might have pulled forward some of the last few years assets since I did a bunch of consolidation and Mint doesn’t do well with this sort of thing.  


**2020: Income - $340k.  Assets at EoY: $880k.  Spent - $44.5k**

Offered a promotion in January, but turned it down for a variety of personal and professional reasons.  Tax man cometh, owed 35k in April.  Verbally offered a much bigger promotion I planned to accept in July which ultimately a new VP blocked.  That should have been the writing on the wall, but I had a rough half because of COVID and was recently let go.  That evening a C-suite client I’d been working with texted and emailed me asking if I was ok and immediately offered to connect me with his sales leadership if I wanted a job.  


**2021: Income: Tracking for $250k, assets today: $1mm.  Spent - On track for $45.5k**

Received competing offers from 2 companies, one a start up and one a well established player.  Decided I was done with the stress that comes with building a team so took the established player despite it being $15k less.  Negotiated a 4 month sabbatical so I could unwind.  Spent that time hiking, reading (up to 43 books so far this year), practicing my hobbies like chess, handwriting (was chicken scratch), working out, and cooking.  Travelled a little, spent a ton of time with my family, recorded an interview with my mom about her childhood (favorite part), and visited my partner at grad school.  New job is good, though it has it’s bullshit.  Tax Man Cometh again.  Owed the IRS $35k in 2021.  Partner got a job that should lead us to living abroad in a few years when I retire.


**Spending:**

Tended to live on the road for work so got all of my weeknight dining and happy hours (entertainment or peer coaching) taken care of by the company.  Pre-COVID almost all the companies I’ve worked for provided breakfast and lunch.  All the same my partner and I like to do a fancy dinner once a quarter and take out once a week.  We’ve gotten a free vacation from my work 3/6 years which we like to extend.  On the years we don’t we’ve done a reasonably priced vacation of about $1000-$2000/person almost always paid for with points. 


**Lifestyle Inflation:**

I’m a regular at a local watering hole that used to cost $4/beer when I moved here and now charges $12.  Rent has gone up because I used to live with my partner but she’s in grad school.  When I moved here I was paying $750/month, now it’s $2,000/month.  When I first graduated making ~50k/year I lived on about $32k after taxes.  Last year after making 340k I spent $44k.  Now that my partner is back I’ll probably land closer to $35-$40k per year.


Over the last 3 years I purchased 2 luxury watches that set me back a total of $51k.  Had both of them assessed this weekend and was offered a total of $74k.  Selling on the private market they’re worth closer to $93k.  These purchases were excluded from my annual spend metrics since they represent one-off purchases and would completely skew the numbers.  


Overall I could have definitely spent less on food, booze, and toys.  Know I could keep grinding at this and have $10m+ after 20 years, but I think 50 year old me would want the 20 years of freedom more.",finance

personalfinance,How to best invest 10k for the short/mid-term,"Hello fellows,

I have €10k in my possession that I would like to invest the best way possible. Let me explain my current situation. I'm a single person in my mid-30s living in the Netherlands. I have a stable normal monthly income in EURO that let me live modestly without hassle, and I also have some savings for any short-term emergency. Now, the options I've been juggling with in terms of how to invest this money are:

1. Pay back a part of a study debt of ~€40k. The reason I don't do this right away is because the loan itself was given with a very low interest rate, so this is not a burden for me now.
2. Send the 10k to a foreign account I own where I could easily get ~8% yearly in interest. The problem I'm facing is the instability of the financial system of that country, the exchange rates, and the potential struggles with bringing the money back to Europe, we.g. fees to pay. Taking into account all the downsides I could get a ~4% net yearly return.
3. Put this money to cryptocurrencies and go with the ups/downs of their volatility.
4. Put this money in a local savings/investment account and see it erode with bank/intermediary fees with the promise of very low interest returns :/
5. I'd like to invest in my own house/appartment, but honestly, 10K does not help in this overheated housing market.

I'm looking for advice (pros and cons) regarding the money allocation options I've been considering or if someone might have better ideas of how to use that money wisely.

Thanks in advance.",finance

stocks,The Continued Bull Market Hypothesis,"The Delta variant is not a threat:

1. Texas, Florida, Missouri and Arkansas account for 60% of new cases. These states will not shut down. They will let the delta variant run wild. Those governors do not care. It won't affect business, unless businesses voluntarily choose to close. In some cases, it may motivate more people to get the vaccine. The vaccination rate is much higher in the NE, West Coast and in major cities.  The delta variant will have less impact on these areas than it will in rural areas.

2. Vaccinated people who get the variant don't end up going to the hospital or die at the same rates as those without the vaccine. Vaccinated people are getting minor symptoms. Almost all hospitalizations and deaths are coming from unvaccinated.

3. The CDC believes that 4.6 times as many people have had the virus and not tested for it than have tested for it. This means presumably that these people who had the virus and didn't get tested were not sick enough to get tested. JPMorgan thinks that about 70-75% of people have either had the virus or had the vaccine or both. So while it is a little surprising that the Delta variant is picking up steam, it probably will begin to peak much sooner than pervious waves simply because more people have been exposed to the virus than with previous waves.

4. Hospital workers are vaccinated at a higher rate than the public. One of the biggest reasons for the shutdowns was to protect our front line health care workers. This can no longer be used as an excuse.

5. The public will not stand for another round of shutdowns. It's not our fault some people don't want to get vaccinated. 

Fundamentals and valuation:

1. Markets are not good at self correcting based on valuation alone. Markets use data points to determine valuation and most data points coming in now suggest a continued bull market. Strong earnings, favorable monetary policy, continued QE until at least the beginning or middle of 2022, few competing alternative investments, clear evidence of transitory inflation, and a rebounding economy that will not shut down all suggest this bull market will continue to go higher. While there may be some profit taking and rebalancing that could lead to a minor correction of 5-10%, the markets will probably re-inflate to the same or higher levels unless there is new data points that suggest the fundamentals are becoming negative. 

2. We are in an upside down market: any bad news is actually good news. This is because any variant threats actually lower the Fed's desire to begin tapering. The longer the Fed runs its QE program, the higher stocks will go.

3. A major sell-off this close to the last is really unprecedented. There is actually more precedent that stocks will become extremely overvalued than there is precedent that there will be another sell-off this close to the last.

4. Major market sell-offs almost always precede or coincide with a recession. Right now, there is not any evidence to suggest another recession is around the corner. And if there was, the Fed and the democratically controlled government would step up with more QE and another round of fiscal stimulus which would drive equity markets higher.

5. How much higher can the market go? The S&amp;P 500 is trading at a forward PE ratio of about 21.5x. Prior to the pandemic, it was trading at close to 18.7x. It's about 15% higher. I think that is easily justifiable based on the more favorable monetary climate alone. For comparison, the CRB commodities index is about 20-25% higher than pre-pandemic. Historically, investors have been willing to pay as much as 25x forward earnings for the S&amp;P 500. So it's possible the market may test that level in the near future, so that would be a 16% run-up in prices. This compares very favorably to the downside risk, which I believe is probably somewhere near 5-10%, which are historically normal amounts for the market corrections. And remember, timing the market underperforms time in the markets, so most of the time, it's better to hold than sell.",finance

personalfinance,To buy or lease my PHEV,"Before I start, yes I know it doesn't make sense to get a new car (especially now, though I get a non-negotiable employee discount so I'm not really affected) but I'm getting one because I really like the car and my current one has a known transmission issue that's showing up again. 

With interest rates being really low I was comparing leasing vs getting a loan for the car. Being a PHEV I'm eligible for a $6840 tax credit if I buy it. If I lease it the company gets it and applies it as an incentive. For a 3 year lease if I put $0 down my monthly payment will be about $630. For a 5 year loan if I put $6840 down my monthly payment will be about $550 with an interest rate of 1.74%. I'll get most, if not all of that $6840 back when I do my taxes at the beginning of next year depending on how much I'm actually taxed (I make about $88k/year so I think I'll get the entire credit) so it'll almost be like putting $0 down.

I'm wondering if it makes more sense to buy with that down payment rather than lease. Reason I considered leasing is cause there's a chance in 3 years there might be a fully electric vehicle I'll want to replace it with. So does it still make sense to buy with those rates even if there's a chance I want to replace it in 3-4 years? Thanks!",finance

financialindependence,Recently FIRED’d and loving it - a public servant’s tale,"Three months ago, I gladly pulled the trigger and RE’d from a career in public service and environmental conservation at age 50. Not as early as some in this sub but much earlier than I anticipated thanks to the FI I created through spending less than I made/living without extravagence, paying myself first, a fortunate “make your own luck” situation, some dumb luck, and avoiding major financial mistakes (although I would make a few different financial choices if I could do things over - see below).

**EDIT:** I should have mentioned that the pension's COLA provisions are very weak, currently around 1% and mine won't begin for another three years. So, the value of the pension will decrease over time due to the eroding effect of inflation.

**Stats at retirement:**

Personal: Age 50, SINK, white male, Colorado (USA) resident

Career: My work has always been environmental conservation through science, policy, and land management, almost entirely in Colorado since college

Highest annual salary at retirement: About $138K

Annual pension benefit: About $104K

Investments: Mix of traditional 401k/457, Roth 401k/457, Roth IRA, brokerage account, HSA. Total value is approximately $350k invested roughly in total stock market offerings (equities, no bonds).

Assets: House in MCOL-HCOL area worth about $600K with about $172K owed on a recently refinanced 30 year loan at 2.75%.

**Career path:** Started as a field biologist in college (bachelors in biology) and pursued it for the first couple of years post-college at a tiny non-profit. Decided to leave the hard sciences and move into the social sciences so I could better influence how wildlife habitat was managed. Went to grad school and got a masters in natural resources policy in order to make this career change. While I hadn’t envisioned a career in public service (was thinking I’d work for an organization like The Nature Conservancy or perhaps an environmental consulting firm), I lucked into a dream job in state government as a program manager for an environmental issue I was really passionate about. After 6-7 years in this role, I took on some management responsibility for another, larger and related program. At year 10, I moved up into management full-time to oversee all the conservation programs in the department. At year 19, I left state government due to politics (mixed blessing). Within six months, I found a more attractive position in local government at a department head level, up from more of a division manager role at the state. While the work was rewarding and a “Dream Job” on paper, the lack of anything approaching a positive work-life balance and ineffective/unsupportive management from elected officials quickly drove me to reconsider how long I wanted to stay in the position. After assessing my financial situation, I decided that RE was the best option for my health (physical and mental) and the right path to achieve a happier life. So, despite the infrequent question I get from some family and friends, “Yes, I am actually retired and don’t plan to look for paid employment in the future.” However, I won’t rule it out if something comes along that really lights my fire. My “career” moving forward is focused on living life fully, growing as a person, and making up for the last 4.5 years when I worked but didn’t live.

**Financial path:** Graduated from college (1992) with about $12K debt in low interest student loans and began to pay them back at the minimum for two years while working as a field biologist and just scraping by. Put loans in deferment when I went back to grad school (1994). Paid for grad school with student loans and working part-time. Graduated (1996) with a total of about $40K debt in low interest student loans. Quickly landed a job with state gov’t starting at $42K and began aggressively paying the loans back at $1K/month while sharing housing and flipping a home with friends from grad school. Flipping wasn’t very profitable ($17K for 18 months of work - evenings, weekends, and holidays) and, in retrospect, not worth the time deferred from living life (good lesson!).

Purchased my own house in 2000 ($234K) in a Denver neighborhood that has only become more desirable over time. Paid PMI until equity exceeded 20%. Started with a 30 year fixed mortgage at 7% but at some point reduced interest rate and term of loan because I was debt averse. Started investing in 401k in 2000 at age 30. After a few years, I was maxing out the 401k (no employer match) by not increasing my lifestyle with each raise but investing instead. Work didn’t offer a Roth 401k option and I neglected to start my own Roth IRA until sometime in my 40s. Early on, I built a very comfortable emergency fund and cash reserve that gave me peace of mind when unexpected expenses came up. In 2012, completed whole house renovation for $140K which I paid for with cash saved as well as rolling some debt into refinanced mortgage loan.

After 19 years in state service and paying into the state pension (not into SS which means I’ll be lucky to get anything from SS), I could see the writing on the wall with the current political appointee department head. Because you can only buy service credit (time served) in the pension system while you are still employed in that system, and rationally expecting that I’d never be employed in the pension system again, I opted to purchase about 7 years of credit (the maximum allowed with my specific circumstances) by liquidating virtually the entire balance of my 401k (approximately $310K). While it was expensive, it turned out to be one of my best financial decisions because it greatly improved my pension value. Over-simplification: the way my pension is constructed, the value increased incrementally from years 0-20 but after year 20, the value of the pension grew more exponentially. Considering that I was almost 46 at the time that I left state service and the pension system, now had acquired about 27 years of service, and could begin drawing a benefit at age 50 (a benefit that would **not** improve the longer I delayed activating it at age 50), I created a big nest-egg that I would be able to benefit from in only four years time.

In a stroke of incredible good luck, within six months I was hired by a local government that had joined the same pension system (a rarity) and at a 16% pay increase. So, I was not only taking on a role with greater decision-making authority and influence, greater opportunity to grow as a leader, etc., but I was earning a larger paycheck within the same pension system which was improving my pension metrics by adding service credit and increasing my highest average salary. However, after a couple of years, I could see a lot of signs that the working conditions weren’t healthy for me. At 4.5 years, I retired from this job and my career in public service.

**Financial optimization:** If I could do it all over again with the benefit of hind-sight and a more refined understanding of financial management, here are some financial moves I’d make differently in my life:

1. Don’t pay off the low interest student loans at more than the minimum agreed amount. Instead, open retirement accounts and start funding at age 26 with approximately $900/month.
2. Open a Roth IRA immediately and fund first to create more balanced pre/post tax accounts for retirement.
3. Rather than flipping a house to earn extra income, find other ways to earn extra income that don’t require investment of as much life energy and will build your professional skill set.
4. Understand all my investment options at my employer. In my situation, I had both 401k and 457 options that could be utilized simultaneously. Understand the nuances of each (including the generous catch-up provisions of the 457) to maximize investments. I would have invested more and more wisely if I’d taken the time to really understand these options.
5. Don’t sit on such a large cash reserve - put it in the market.
6. Don’t chase lower interest rates by refinancing into shorter-term (10-15 year) fixed mortgage rates, at least at today’s rates. Don’t pay more than agreed; instead invest in the market.

Granted, I don’t think I made any serious financial errors but I think these changes would have improved my current and future financial position more than marginally.

**Long-term financial outlook:** My pension is currently paying me more than I need to live comfortably and enjoy life. However, over time, inflation will severely erode its purchasing power since I aim to live another 40-50 years. Consequently, I will need robust market investments that grow to yield distributions that offset the future effects of inflation. Because the pension delivers a predictable paycheck and underlying base of monthly financial security, my market investments are currently aggressively allocated.

While the long-term security of any public pension is not certain, I generally feel that Colorado has done an OK job of shoring up the pension system and preserving its ability to meet obligations. However, one of the changes recently made reduced the annual inflation adjustment. Consequently, under present rules, present value will not be maintained against inflation. This reinforces the need for investments that supplement pension payouts over time. Pensions may once have been designed to provide entirely for a retiree’s needs (and I certainly am benefiting from older, more generous terms than people currently joining the system as new employees). However, this is not practical to expect, particularly as someone retiring at age 50.

As an American, it goes without saying that the uncertain cost of annual health insurance coverage remains the largest variable for me for the next 15 years. Sigh… However, I’ve generally been blessed with good health and have made my health a top priority now that I’m free from the stress of my last job. Fingers crossed. Note: Unlike many here who can manage their reported income from 401k, brokerage accounts, etc., to take advantage of ACA subsidies, I can’t do that with my pension. It pays a fixed amount that ensures my annual income will far exceed ACA thresholds and I’ll be unable to take advantage of free or low-cost healthcare. I’m not complaining - I’m fortunate to have the income I have. But my monthly healthcare premiums went from a net of \~$10/month for a high deductible, HSA-compatible plan through my last employer to $382/month for a plan through the marketplace.

Lastly, I have a great house in a great neighborhood so I will have a meaningful asset to utilize in the future as I age and my situation changes.

**Philosophical:** A persistent theme that runs throughout many posts in the FIRE community is a resignation to a short-ish life of misery working one’s ass off at an intolerable job in order to amass as large a portfolio in as short a period of time in order to achieve FI and/or RE. Many OPs bemoan the grind and the sense of worthlessness in what they do for a living. At least, that’s how a lot of it comes across to me.

My experience has been a distinct contrast to this paradigm/attitude. I’ve been able to pursue my environmental conservation values through my career for about 30 years. And, I’ve been able to FIRE at a reasonable age (sure, it’s not 35 or 40). At the risk of offending some redditors, I assert that you don’t have to take a job or pursue a career in which you find little/no meaning, be a slave to earning as large an income as possible, or sacrifice your life in the short term in order to FIRE. It’s possible to pursue your passions, make a difference in the world, and find meaning and value in your day job. I’m proud of my work trying to make the world a better place and was able to FIRE at 50. If not for the poor management and lack of real support from my elected officials at my last job, I’d still be there for another 5 years or so before retiring. It wouldn’t have been financially necessary but it certainly would have sweetened my financial situation. However, I’m grateful that my life path and choices (and some luck) led to being FI by 50 (or earlier if needed) so I could leave what was becoming an increasingly toxic work situation. And, it was certainly nice to know I had my FU money when things started to get really frustrating at work.

**Appreciation and giving back:** I’ve been a lurker on r/financialindendence and related FIRE subreddits. On occasion, I’ve posted a couple of questions in the last couple of years to help refine my understanding of the mathematics of my situation. More importantly, it’s really helped me prepare mentally for a successful retirement by reading the non-mathmatical/mechanical FIRE posts - the ones about how to answer questions from friends/family, develop a healthy structure once the work day structure disappears, etc. I want to express my appreciation to those who’ve provided helpful information and advice both to posts and on DMs. I’m looking forward to providing what support I can in return and am also working in my own community of friends to support and advise friends who are interested in FIRE or just good personal finance. I also encourage some of the young people in my life to learn the basics (like the power of compounding interest) so they understand what they have to get right (the big rocks) in order to do well. In the future, I’m interested in volunteering through a structured program to provide financial counseling and I’d be interested in hearing from anyone who’s doing this in their community.

**WayTLDR:** Fire’d at 50 from a career in public service at local and state government levels. Although I didn’t anticipate RE at age 50, attaining FI allowed me to leave my last position which was growing intolerable due to no work-life balance and poor management from elected officials. Now focused on me: regaining my health and fitness, decompressing, reconnecting with friends and family, pursuing my own life. The best I can describe my current situation is that it feels natural!

I’m happy to answer questions and have been looking forward to hearing GFY aimed squarely at me!",finance

stocks,The Continued Bull Market Hypothesis,"The Delta variant is not a threat:

1. Texas, Florida, Missouri and Arkansas account for 60% of new cases. These states will not shut down. They will let the delta variant run wild. Those governors do not care. It won't affect business, unless businesses voluntarily choose to close. In some cases, it may motivate more people to get the vaccine. The vaccination rate is much higher in the NE, West Coast and in major cities.  The delta variant will have less impact on these areas than it will in rural areas.

2. Vaccinated people who get the variant don't end up going to the hospital or die at the same rates as those without the vaccine. Vaccinated people are getting minor symptoms. Almost all hospitalizations and deaths are coming from unvaccinated.

3. The CDC believes that 4.6 times as many people have had the virus and not tested for it than have tested for it. This means presumably that these people who had the virus and didn't get tested were not sick enough to get tested. JPMorgan thinks that about 70-75% of people have either had the virus or had the vaccine or both. So while it is a little surprising that the Delta variant is picking up steam, it probably will begin to peak much sooner than pervious waves simply because more people have been exposed to the virus than with previous waves.

4. Hospital workers are vaccinated at a higher rate than the public. One of the biggest reasons for the shutdowns was to protect our front line health care workers. This can no longer be used as an excuse.

5. The public will not stand for another round of shutdowns. It's not our fault some people don't want to get vaccinated. 

Fundamentals and valuation:

1. Markets are not good at self correcting based on valuation alone. Markets use data points to determine valuation and most data points coming in now suggest a continued bull market. Strong earnings, favorable monetary policy, continued QE until at least the beginning or middle of 2022, few competing alternative investments, clear evidence of transitory inflation, and a rebounding economy that will not shut down all suggest this bull market will continue to go higher. While there may be some profit taking and rebalancing that could lead to a minor correction of 5-10%, the markets will probably re-inflate to the same or higher levels unless there is new data points that suggest the fundamentals are becoming negative. 

2. We are in an upside down market: any bad news is actually good news. This is because any variant threats actually lower the Fed's desire to begin tapering. The longer the Fed runs its QE program, the higher stocks will go.

3. A major sell-off this close to the last is really unprecedented. There is actually more precedent that stocks will become extremely overvalued than there is precedent that there will be another sell-off this close to the last.

4. Major market sell-offs almost always precede or coincide with a recession. Right now, there is not any evidence to suggest another recession is around the corner. And if there was, the Fed and the democratically controlled government would step up with more QE and another round of fiscal stimulus which would drive equity markets higher.

5. How much higher can the market go? The S&amp;P 500 is trading at a forward PE ratio of about 21.5x. Prior to the pandemic, it was trading at close to 18.7x. It's about 15% higher. I think that is easily justifiable based on the more favorable monetary climate alone. For comparison, the CRB commodities index is about 20-25% higher than pre-pandemic. Historically, investors have been willing to pay as much as 25x forward earnings for the S&amp;P 500. So it's possible the market may test that level in the near future, so that would be a 16% run-up in prices. This compares very favorably to the downside risk, which I believe is probably somewhere near 5-10%, which are historically normal amounts for the market corrections. And remember, timing the market underperforms time in the markets, so most of the time, it's better to hold than sell.",finance
personalfinance,"Need to sell one of two cars, how to decide which to sell?","Hi all,

My wife and I are moving to a VHCOL area. We have decided to sell one of our two cars because of parking limitations along with great public transportation in this area. The cars are similar in regard to age, mileage, type, etc. but each of us prefers our own car slightly over the other. Our discussion on the topic has yet to end in a consensus so we wanted some outside perspective.

The Carmax appraisal (where we plan to sell) is very close to kbb value for the Kia, we are assuming it will also be similar for the Toyota, but they won’t provide an appraisal for it online since they don’t have enough data for that model.

Here are the cars:

**1) 2019 Kia Rio, 31k miles**

\- Bought used for $11k

\- $4.1k on loan remaining, $100 per month payments

\- Kbb value: $14890

\- Would need to register car in state we are moving to

**2) 2020 Toyota corolla, 29k miles**

\- Bought new for $17k

\- $10.9k on loan remaining, $350 per month payments

\- Kbb value: $17636

\- Car is already registered in state we are moving to

Interest rates are similar on both loans (\~5%). Both cars are in great condition, perfect marks on inspections, no accidents, and clean. We got insurance quotes for both scenarios and it's only a matter of $10 difference in the 6-month premium.

Thanks!

CryptoCurrency,Tracker Tool - Central Bank Digital Currency,"This is an interesting tool that tracks CBDCs.

What exactly is a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC)? A CBDC is virtual money backed and issued by a central bank. As cryptocurrencies and stablecoins have become more popular, the world’s central banks have realized that they need to provide an alternative—or let the future of money pass them by.

81 countries (representing over 90 percent of global GDP) are now exploring a CBDC. In our original report published in May 2020, only 35 countries were considering a CBDC.

Of the countries with the 4 largest central banks (the US Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank, the Bank of Japan, and the Bank of England), the United States is furthest behind.

I feel the US isn’t taking this as serious as we should be and will look back at this time as a major failure…

EDIT: I understand that this is against what we all want for crypto currency but it would be foolish to not think this is the direction we are heading.  Governments are not going to give up this power willingly.  The US is on track to lose some of this power it has enjoyed since world war 2.

Luckily I locked in with a builder before lumber and houses really went crazy so the same model house I just got is selling for $50,000 more today then when I singed my contract.

The new house was about $150,000 more then I bought my last house my last one but because of the great interest rates, making more at my current job, and profit from selling my old house much higher then I bought it for my payments only went up by about $150 a month because I put down 25% down this time versus 5% when I bought my first house.

The first 5% down payment for the new house I took a loan against my 401k so I could get the build started and stay in my old house a little longer. Today I paid back to loan to my 401K so that's now taken care of.

After adding the other 20% down to the house, and paying back the 401k loan. I also paid off 2 car loans for my wife and I, my student loans, and all CC debt that my family had so now other then the new mortgage we are debt free. I am left with a decent size emergency fund after all of that as well.

I am currently putting 5% into my 401K at work (which is to get the maximum match), I am also planning to start a Roth IRA for both my Wife and I and trying to max them out. Also going to start some plans for my kids college funds.

I have been working at a federal position for almost 3 years as SQL programmer/data analyst. I've gotten a 'raise' last September, but it doesn't kick in until this upcoming September (not retroactive either). I brought up how i want to do more/different from my current position around May. And my boss was really receptive and even talked about how he was planning on giving me a promotion. Then, the during the midyear review (maybe a month after), he didn't even bring it up which was a bit frustrating. So, I've been looking around for a new opportunity.

I found applied for a few different positions, and I got an offer that pays 25K more, but it's a start up company. The last funding was Series D in Feb. 2020 for 100M, which I think is ok? I do like the position they are offering me, but I do hear a lot of push back from friends about it. I'm not sure if going into a start up is a correct move for me, especially with a baby.

In summer 2020, I left Federal service after several years for a private opportunity. At the time, I filed out the form to withdraw my FERS pension. I opted to roll over my contributions (post-tax) to my existing Roth IRA account and to roll over my earned interest (tax-deferred) to a traditional IRA that I created to accept the rollover. Vanguard is the custodian for both accounts.

In January 2021, I contributed $6,000 to the Vanguard traditional IRA and backdoor-ed it to my Roth account as I will go over the Roth contribution limit.

I recently received a letter from the Office of Personnel Management that they have authorized the refund of my retirement contributions (\~$20k) and interest ($1.5k). I'll be honest, I'd kind of forgotten that I had made this request and rolled over the interest to the Traditional IRA when I did the backdoor Roth in January.

Looking to avoid the pro-rata rule hell for the rest of the time the backdoor Roth is allowed, what is my best play with the $1.5k that's going in to my Traditional IRA? Ask Vanguard to recharacterize it as a Roth contribution and pay 25% tax on it next spring? Is that even an option? Am I overthinking this and should I just let it sit in the Traditional account (invested, of course), which prior to the refund had a $0 balance? Any other implications or concerns that I've overlooked?",finance

But, most people even people on this sub are still married to fiat currency, even though they say they are not.

With that said the lady at the bank (boomer) needed a reason for the loan, i.e. what was i doing with it and I told her ""buying bitcoin"". She seemed interested, like maybe she had heard people talking about it before and she started asking me questions about it. some basic questions about what is it? etc... so I answered her questions and she gave me the loan. Seemed like a nice lady but this is again proof people that we are still very early into the adoption of bitcoin. People at banks barely know what the hell it is. At the end I basically told her I don't trust the feds printing my hard earned money into infinity, and she agreed.

But then in the mid 2010’s a miracle happened - new math was anonymously put forward that let us do exactly this.  The Cryptonote Protocol and Mimblewimble (yes yes, moon math too) have given us powerful new tools to establish decentralized money that’s also fundamentally private.  This (along with defi) is the next generation of cryptocurrency tech.  
  
**It doesn’t matter what the oligarch dinosaurs think**.  We’re not here to beg them for permission to have freedom.  **Privacy is our fundamental human right**.  And those corrupt fucks have shown again and again they can’t be trusted to take that right away.  
  
So stop cowering to their tyranny, and stop thinking of crypto as an “*uwu pweeesze may i mistress yellen??* O.O” endeavor.  Crypto is here to disrupt and perhaps even destroy the corrupt perpetual war machine that is fiat, and even if *you* use it’s immense power for something else - the true face of this technology is far more majestic than most can comprehend.  
   
Embrace it.  And embrace your fundamental right to privacy as a sovereign intelligence on this Earth.  Finally, for the first time in centuries we have the freedom of money once more.  Of course the oligarchs aren’t happy about that.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,FedLoan Servicing and Granite State Management &amp; Resources will no longer be managing student loans,"I guess this isn't exactly ""new"" news since FedLoan announced this early July, but it's the first I've heard of it. Basically FedLoan Servicing and Granite State Management &amp; Resources are not renewing their contracts and their customers will be switched to a new loan servicer. They haven't announced who that will be or when the switch will happen but here are a few tips for anyone whose loans are currently held with those companies:

1. Make sure your contact information with your current loan servicer is correct and update it if it's not.
2. Get a record of your previous payments, especially any loans that are officially marked as paid off. Transitioning millions of borrowers is bound to end up with some errors and you want to be able to prove your case if it happens to you.
3. Be extra cautious of any mail, emails, or phone calls regarding your loans. Get all your information directly from your current loan servicer, the department of education's official website ([https://studentaid.gov/announcements-events/loan-servicer-updates](https://studentaid.gov/announcements-events/loan-servicer-updates)), or your new loan servicer once it's verified they have your loans now.
4. If you use autopay (or used autopay before the moratorium) you'll probably have to set that back up with your new account. Make sure you do this before your first payment with your new servicer is due!

Also important to note they state on the department of education's website that:

""This change will not impact the existing terms, conditions, interest rates, loan discharge or forgiveness programs, or available repayment plans on the loans. It also will not change the temporary payment suspension and 0% interest benefits borrowers are currently receiving due to the coronavirus emergency.""",finance

stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Tuesday, July 27, 2021","**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, July 27, 2021**

Stocks declined following a record-setting session yesterday as concerns over the coronavirus delta came to a head, with the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reversing their indoor mask policy, recommending that fully vaccinated people begin wearing masks indoors again in areas with high coronavirus transmission and in K-12 schools. Dr. Rochelle Walensky, Director of the CDC said, “In areas with substantial and high transmission, CDC recommends fully vaccinated people wear masks in public, indoor settings to help prevent the spread of the delta variant, and protect others. This includes schools”. As I have said before and will explain further below, while the surge in cases is unfortunate, it is important to note that the surge is largely concentrated in areas with high vaccine hesitancy. In my humble opinion, as it usually does, the market is overreacting to the news, personally I remain bullish moving forward, though one always has to acknowledge the risks present in the market.

In other news, Chinese stocks kept plummeting as the regulatory crackdown by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) intensified. For context, Alibaba (BABA) is down 10% this week, roughly 50% from its previous all-time high and is trading at roughly the same price as in March 2020. In the US, eyes are on earnings, with mega-caps Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), and Apple (AAPL) all reporting. Chip-maker AMD is also reporting. Combined, these companies have a market cap greater than $6.5 trillion.

In the US, despite roughly 50% of the population being vaccinated, in the past two weeks, infections across the country have roughly doubled, with new cases jumping from 13,200 on July 4 to 51,939 on July 25, according to data compiled by John Hopkins University. 

However, it is important to understand that the rising infections are broadly concentrated in areas with higher vaccine hesitancy. According to data from the CDC, 97% of people who have died or been hospitalized with COVID-19 since the vaccine became widely available are unvaccinated. Dr Rochelle Walensky, Director of CDC said of the rising cases, “There is a clear message that is coming through. This is becoming a pandemic of the unvaccinated. Our biggest concern is we are going to continue to see preventable cases, hospitalizations, and sadly deaths among the unvaccinated.” Sadly, despite the widespread availability of the vaccine in the US, hesitancy in certain places remains very high.

David Kostin, US Equity Strategist at Goldman Sachs said, “We \[Goldman Sachs\] think the Delta variant should pose a minimal risk to the US equity market. From an economic perspective, widespread vaccinations and strategies focused on containment suggest limited medical and economic downside even if infections continue to rise. From a flows perspective, robust household cash balances and corporate buyback authorizations should continue to support inflows for equities, increasing the likelihood that market participants perceive a pullback as a buying opportunity”. I agree, given the transmission is largely concentrated in certain areas, I do not expect the re-introduction of lockdown measures that could hamper the current pace of recovery. Of course, that's just my opinion.

Now onto earnings, Microsoft beat earnings estimates but it seems market participants were hoping for a larger beat of the estimates, with the stock falling 3% after-hours. Here are the numbers. 

* **Revenue:** $46.15 billion versus $44.25 billion expected
* **Earnings per share:** $2.17 versus $1.92 expected
* **Productivity and Business Processes:** $14.69 billion versus $13.9 billion expected
* **Intelligent Cloud:** $17.38 billion versus $16.4 billion expected
* **More Personal Computing:** $14.09 billion versus $13.8 billion expected

Importantly, Microsoft saw revenues from Azure, its cloud computing platform, rise 51% year-on-year. In total, revenues were up 21% compared to the same quarter last year, great growth for the second largest publicly traded company. 

Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) smashed earnings estimates and the stock jumped roughly 2.5% before cooling down somewhat. Here are the numbers

* **Earnings per share (EPS):** $27.26 vs $19.34 per share
* **Revenue:** $61.88 billion vs $56.16 billion
* **YouTube advertising revenue:** $7.00 billion vs $6.37 billion expected
* **Google Cloud revenue:** $4.63 billion vs $4.40 billion expected, 
* **Traffic acquisition costs (TAC):** $10.93 billion vs $9.74 billion expected

Importantly, Alphabet saw Google ad revenue ballooned to $50.44 billion, a roughly 69% increase year-on-year. Just to put into context how massive Alphabet is, revenue from Youtube was $7 billion, an 83% increase year-on-year and roughly the entire revenue of Netflix ($7.34 billion). 

Apple (AAPL), the largest company in the world, absolutely demolished earnings with some of the most impressive earnings beats I’ve seen. The stock reaction is largely muted. Here are the numbers

* **EPS**: $1.30 vs. $1.01 estimated 
* **Revenue**: $81.41 billion vs. $73.30 billion estimated, up 36% year-over-year 
* **iPhone revenue**: $39.57 billion vs. $34.01 billion estimated, up 49.78% year-over-year 
* **Services revenue**: $17.48 billion vs. $16.33 billion estimated, up 33% year-over-year 
* **Other Products revenue**: $8.76 billion vs. $7.80 billion estimated, up 40% year-over-year 
* **Mac revenue**:$8.24 billion vs. $8.07 billion estimated, up 16% year-over-year 
* **iPad revenue**: $7.37 billion vs. $7.15 billion estimated, up 12% year-over-year 
* **Gross margin**: 43.3% vs. 41.9% estimated 

Apple also had a strong quarter in its Greater China region, which includes Taiwan and Hong Kong in addition to the mainland. Apple reported $14.76 billion in sales in the region, up 58% year-on-year/. Sales in America were up nearly 33% year-over-year to $39.57 billion. 

In other news, later this week, investors will hear from Federal Reserve officials over the path forward for monetary policy, which will likely be informed by the increased concerns over the Delta variant and peaking economic growth rates. Analysts are predicting that the downside risks still present in the economy will continue to overshadow potential worries over inflation, which means members of the Fed are very unlikely to make any changes in the upcoming meeting. What I am most interested in from these meetings is hearing about a potential timeline to begin tapering quantitative easing (QE). I expect the Fed will make some kind of announcement regarding this before the year ends. The real test for equities is coming in 2023, when the interest rate is expected to begin rising.

business,Why are Uber drivers not classified as employees?,"The IRS.gov website states:

btc,Let's talk about Bridges!,"Good news everyone! As SmartBCH mainnet launch nears,  it is a good moment to talk about blockchain bridges, how they work and what we can do with them. As you know in order for BCH to be moved from the base layer into SmartBCH, a bridge is needed. In order for both base layer and side-chain components to ""talk"" to each other, a group of servers is used. These servers are called federators, and they are run by independent parties so that we can be certain that the movement of value is always secure.

If a BCH coin needs to be moved into SmartBCH, the user will send it to a specific wallet address, the coin is then locked into that address; this follows a call by federators to a contract on the SmartBCH side that will then mint a coin and send it to the destination SmartBCH wallet. A similar process occurs if a user wants to send BCH from SmartBCH back to the base layer, in this case, the coins on SmartBCH are simply destroyed, and then the coins on the base layer are unlocked and sent to the corresponding wallet.

It is important to have in mind the possibility of a chain reorganization and is for this reason that several block confirmations need to be done before coins get to their wallets. There was a recent discussion by the community on the possibility of reducing block times (while keeping total block reward unchanged) to 1 minute. Such improvement will GREATLY benefit the movement of value between the base and side-chain layers, as time will be reduced and improve the UX. It is my hope that the community would consider this option.

So those are the very basics of how value is moved between the Bitcoin Cash base layer and Smart Bitcoin Cash layer. Now let's explore further possibilities. Just as we are able to bridge Bitcoin Cash to Smart Bitcoin Cash, we can also bridge Smart Bitcoin Cash to Ethereum, This creates a lot of new use cases for our ecosystem.

First, let's review how a bridge between Smart Bitcoin Cash and Ethereum would work. Just as with the Bitcoin to Smart Bitcoin cash system, the bridge to Ethereum makes use of Federator servers. These federator servers watch over certain contracts on Ethereum, once a coin, token, NFT come into the bridge contract, the federators are in charge of validating the transfer by then voting on the SmartBCH side on the minting of the same coins, tokens or NFTs. The process is very safe, as the people that run the federators validating the transfer are all independent parties. In other words, any action that the contracts make need to be signed by multiple independent members. An example would be [Bitcoin.com](https://Bitcoin.com) , SmartBCH dev team and our team having to sign for every single contract interaction. Not a single party can take action without the other signatures. The contracts are audited so that this is always enforced. No token can be created or moved without multiple independent signatures.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[Bitcoin Cash - Smart Bitcoin Cash - Ethereum](https://preview.redd.it/1lzvgk6erud71.png?width=1893&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=15ddab70721b5c17d7585c28135adb228d970488)

But why do we want a bridge with Ethereum? I personally believe that all Blockchains with a future would end up interconnecting to each other. Think about it like the early days of university servers being interconnected to form the internet.  Just as this allowed to create the worldwide web, the connection of blockchains would allow for value and digital property to freely flow across the most efficient blockchains. A true internet of value.

Once the bridge to Ethereum is ready, we would then be able to move ETH into SmartBCH, then a decentralized exchange would have BCH/ETH pairs, all completely decentralized, with very small fees and completely secure!  Any token or NFT on Ethereum becomes available, DAI could be moved, so a pair like BCH/DAI becomes available. Just as we can move tokens from Ethereum to SmartBCH, we can also move SmartBCH tokens/coins and NFTs. So we can easily move BCH into Ethereum, and then make the best of Ethereums DEFI tools and network effect! Another example would be FlexUSD being sent into Ethereum to then create a trading pair on Uniswap ver3 wBCH/FlexUSD! Want to move your NFT to a game based on the  SmartBCH platform, it can be done in seconds! As SmartBCH and Ethereum blocks times are short,  transfers will take just a couple of seconds. Where we going there are no exchanges, is all decentralized, services, DAOS, identities, NFTs. All running on multiple independent blockchains, that are also interconnected.

Last, we are in the process of testing our bridge and will be making it available not much later after the SmarBCH mainnet is launched. We will be doing a flipstarter, the funds will allow us to focus our efforts into this project, pay for security audits and generate a revenue stream to maintain the project long-term. We really hope you consider supporting us! Thank you!

Ripple,What digital currency accomplishes for central banks.,"It is really just a shift of power away from your personal autonomy and toward banks. If inflation runs hot, CBs can raise fees on all of your transactions to suck some heat out of the system, reducing money supply and reducing your willingness to move your money while keeping the banks’ income constant or improving. They are, after all, central planners who have long believed they can manage the economy better than a free market (which we haven’t seen in a very long time).

Digital currency increases bank profitability by having less transaction friction. At the same time, it offers you greater convenience, but at the cost of less autonomy because it gives the banks more ways to trap you into paying fees if you want to move your own money or just want to store your own money. You can’t take it outside of their management and their possession.

With CBDCs, central banks can manipulate your choices more directly. They can also monitor all that is happening in the economy down to the most finite transactions. Even if they don’t track who spent the money, they would have the potential to know what every cent was spent on and where it was spent.

Realistically, central banks don’t want negative interest rates any more than you do if they can be avoided. Negative interest rates have proven all over the world to be damaging to banks and perilous for economies to navigate. So, you can strike that off your list as a primary reason central banks want digital currencies. (In our Patron Posts we’ve seen central bankers telling each other that negative interest rates aren’t the best reason for going to CBDCs.)

Central banksters would prefer to successfully manage the economy without having to go to negative interest to stimulate the economy. As pointed out in one Patron Post, going negative has resulted in some banks in some nations paying people to take out mortgages — not something banks inherently like to do.

The way that worked was that the mortgage holder had to make regular payments, but the bank wrote down the principle each month by more than the payment. It’s insane, and even banks know that it is not the business model they prefer. Central banks essentially forced it by creating money in reserve accounts and then penalizing banks if they held on to it.

Banks have struggled a lot to figure out how to work in a negative-interest environment when their models have been built for centuries around making money off positive interest. They’d rather not.

Beware that banks don’t fully think of the money they manage as your money. At the higher CB level, they consider all money as being their money since they created all of it out of loans they entrusted into your hands to put to specified uses, such as to buy a house or a car or inventory (“flooring”) for your auto dealership. They think less of themselves as stewards of your money than you as a steward of theirs. That high-minded central-bank attitude filters down through the system to varying degrees.

After that first collateralized loan where the purchase was specified, however, the newly created money migrates into generalized use anywhere people want to spend it. Banks would like to control what you can do with it at all stages to some extent as well as have a clearer understanding of how much if flowing where in the economy.

One example of something banks might like to control: if they create lots of new money, and you just pay off loans, that doesn’t help them because they were making interest on those loans, and now they’re not. All they did was create money for you to use to take away one of their income streams. If, for example, they create money by loaning it to the government at low interest, and the government gives it to you as a stimulus check, and then you pay off part of your highest interest loan with it, that doesn’t help the banks.

That is largely what happened with the “stimulus” checks:

“This ‘new threat’ to the U.S. economy flies in the face of conventional wisdom“:“Americans are slashing their spending, hoarding cash and shrinking their credit card debt as they fear their jobs could disappear during the coronavirus pandemic.“That is the lead in a CNN Business story this week about how U.S. consumers have been navigating one of the greatest financial curveballs the world has ever seen. MarketWatch It seems prudent, considering the climate, but how irresponsible of you not to think of serving the economic interests of the nation (and its banks) foremost in your personal financial plans.

Credit-card debt dropped by its biggest percentage in more than three decades, while savings jumped to levels not seen since the Reagan era. We can’t have that! You are taking too much responsibility into your own hands. Or, as banks would put it, you are just hording cash (which is fine when they do it, but not when you do as they don’t make money when you pay off loans, instead of taking out more).

That is good, right? Not necessarily…. “Although caution is a logical response to that uncertainty, hunkering down also poses a risk to the recovery in an economy dominated by consumer spending.’",cryptocurrency

CryptoCurrency,I believe the full-blown bullmarket will accompany the roll-out of major corporations' cryptocurrencies,"The following is my own personal articulated opinion, and should not be considered as anything beyond that.

I have been following this market for about 4 years now. Was never interested in micro-movements and almost never tried to day-trade. I have always been a big picture kind of guy and this has given me substantial gains. 

I am rather surprised by the short-sightedness of most retail investors, and I want to delve a little bit into the politics around this market...

With an upcoming bullmarket (yes I believe it is coming), I cannot see how major corporations can afford to miss out on said bullmarket - especially the mania phase of the bullmarket - without having their own horses in the race. 
I just cannot logically see that happening. It would be absurd of them to not get their lion's share of the cake.

I know most of us here believe that cryptocurrencies are our way to freedom from the classical (somewhat authoritarian) financial systems and bank dependence; BUT, I don't think the reality is as flowery as we think it is. I don't think that major banks and corporations are just going to watch as we in broad daylight escape their grip and achieve our financial freedom as well as our autonomy and privacy/anonymity, and go on to live in LaLa land and sing happy songs. 
Life is not a fairytale. 

This specific market cycle is a major domino in the adoption of cryptocurrency... 
Just as any average person among us with our humble resources WOULD not miss this wave and this opportunity, these major corporations with their geniuses and their trillions and their titanic influence WILL not miss it either. 

Now call it whatever you want, but I feel like Elon Musk forcibly came into the space, artificially pumped it, and then artificially delayed the bullmarket for aforementioned reasons. 

And ever since his bullshit started, the whole space has felt a lot less organic, and I have honestly lost interest and joy in following the news. (Thank you Elon for sucking all the magic out of this space 🙂)

Yes, I believe Elon musk has and does exert this kind of power over this space. 
And I understand that Elon is not the only player, but he is major PUBLIC player who has publically trolled us and rubbed in our noses the fact the he CAN manipulate anything in this space; from worthless coins to the alpha don dada of cryptocurrencies - Bitcoin.

Now, what corporations am I talking about?

stocks,Ray Dalio Principles of Navigating Big Debt Crises Summary Part 1,"# **Ray Dalio**

# **Principles of Navigating Big Debt Crises**

-	Policy makers have 4 levers to pull when dealing with debt
  - Austerity
  - Debt defaults/Restructurings
  - Central Bank printing money &amp;quot;QE&amp;quot;
  - Transfers of money and credit
-	The first 2 are deflationary and the latter 2 are inflationary. Which levers the policy makers pull determine who benefits and who suffers. This process is painful for everyone
-	**Template of a debt crisis**
-	Typically occur because debt and debt service costs rise faster than the incomes needed to service that debt
  - Usually, a central bank can alleviate typical debt crises by lowering interest rates, but severe crises occur when that is no longer possible. IE - 0% interest rates
  - Classically, a lot of short-term debt cycles leads to a long-term debt cycle.
-	Long term debt cycles are just bigger versions of short-term debt cycles
-	During the upswing, credit is freely available and people are willing to take on more risk
-	Credit is cut during a crisis. Asset prices fall, debtors have trouble servicing debt, investors get scared and cautious which leads to liquidity problems
-	Deflationary Depressions – typically occur in countries where most of the debt is financed by the local currency
-	Inflationary Depressions – typically occur in countries where most of the debt is financed by foreign currency
-	Positive effects of debt cycles come first; negative come later
-	Typically, the worst debt bubbles are not accompanied by high and rising inflation, but by asset price inflation financed by debt growth
  - This is because policymakers make the mistake of accommodating debt growth because they are focused on inflation and/or growth, not on debt growth itself, the asset inflations they are producing, and whether or not debts will be able to be serviced
-	It is the tightening of monetary policy that usually pops a bubble
-	No specific event or shock caused the stock market bubble to burst in 1929
-	During a severe economic downturn, protectionist/populist policies begin to rise and outrage over the governments role in &amp;quot;bailing out&amp;quot; financial institutions
-	Once policymakers shift their attention to increasing financial regulation and oversight, that typically signals the of the big debt cycle
-	It is typically the case that the first tightening or policy does not hurt stocks and the economy
-	By 1937, all currencies had all devalued a lot against Gold, but not so much against each other
-	Gold bullion is the only asset that has no counterparty risk

# **Classic Deflationary Debt Cycle**

-	Early – Debt is not growing faster than incomes. Debt is financing activities that produce growth. Known as &amp;quot;Goldilocks&amp;quot; period
-	Bubble – Debt is rising faster than incomes and this produces strong asset returns and growth. This process is generally self-reinforcing because it allows people to borrow more. This can go on for decades. These are short term cycles but lots of them adding up can lead to a long-term debt cycle
  - Usually start from Bull markets. Lower interest rates drive asset prices higher, which leads to economic growth and the ability to take on more debt
  - Lending standards are reduced as people and business lever up
  - Lenders and speculators make lots of fast/easy money which reinforces the bubble
  - As a bubble nears the top of the cycle, the economy is the most vulnerable, but people are feeling the wealthiest and the most bullish
  - The Boom encourages new speculators into the market further driving up prices
  - Humans by nature tend to move in crowds and weight recent experiences more heavily. This causes people to extrapolate too much from the recent past in both up and down markets
  - Central banks usually target inflation or inflation/growth and don&amp;#39;t target the management of bubbles, the debt growth they enable can go on to finance the creation of bubbles. And the bursting of bubbles can cause severe economic pain
  - Don&amp;#39;t only look at one metric to serve as an indicator of a debt crisis
  - Monetary policy, in many cases, helps inflate the bubble rather than constrain it
    - How to Spot a Bubble
      - Prices are high relative to traditional measures
      - Broad bullish sentiment
      - Purchases are financed by high leverage
      - New buyers enter the market
      - Buyers make very forward purchases to speculate or protect themselves from future price gains
      - Stimulative monetary policy reinflates the bubble and tight monetary policy contributes to its popping
-	The Top – prices have been driven by a lot of leveraged buying and the market gets fully long, leveraged, and overpriced, it becomes rip for reversal
  - Most often occurs when the central bank starts to tighten and interest rates rise for whatever reason
  - This causes a debt service squeeze and hurts asset prices. Which reduces the amount of money lenders are willing to lend out as they become cautious
  - Investors move from risk assets to less risky assets slowing down growth
  - A negative &amp;quot;wealth effect&amp;quot; occurs when one&amp;#39;s wealth declines, which leads to less lending and spending. This is due to both negative psychology and financial condition
  - Yield curve is usually flat or inverted
    - People are incentivized to move into cash just before the crash which itself slows down lending
  - Unemployment is low
  - The more leverage that exists and the higher the prices, the less tightening it takes to prick the bubble and the bigger the bust that follows
    - Immediate post bubble period
    - People mistakenly judge the decline to be a buying opportunity and find &amp;quot;cheap&amp;quot; stocks failing to see that earning are likely to decline much more. They extrapolate too much from the recent past
    - Wealth falls first and incomes fall later, creditworthiness worsens, which constricts lending activity, this hurt spending and lowers investments and makes borrowing more difficult
    - As asset prices fall, the lenders tighten lending standards which hurts spending and investment
    - This causes people to sell investments to raise cash which causes more driving down of prices and is a self-reinforcing cycle
-	The &amp;quot;Depression&amp;quot;
  - In a normal recession, cutting interest rates can stimulate the economy. But in a depression, rates can&amp;#39;t be cut because they are already at 0%
  - The central banks have to go to alternative ways to stimulate the economy. IE – &amp;quot;QE&amp;quot; or printing money or stimulus
  - Declines of 50% of people&amp;#39;s assets are common
  - As the depression begins, defaults and restructurings hit the various people. Especially leveraged ones (Banks)
  - Runs on banks are common
  - At this stage of the cycle, debt defaults and austerity dominate which are deflationary
  - People financial condition worsens, which makes lenders more reluctant to loan money. Which slows down the economy
  - Usually, institutions and policymakers have learned from the past, but not every depression is the same as before and this catches them off guard. It doesn&amp;#39;t tend to play out like the last one that they are defending against
  - If the central bank prints money to alleviate the credit shortage, it can cause inflation if not careful
  - A big part of this deleveraging process is that people discover that much of what they thought they of as wealth was simply other people promises to give them money. And now those promises are not being kept and that wealth isn&amp;#39;t real
  - Fear cascades through the system, and these fears feed on themselves and lead to a scramble for cash that results in a shortage (investors sell assets)
  - The depression phase is dominated by deflationary forces of debt reduction
  - The investor class experiences a tremendous loss of &amp;quot;real&amp;quot; wealth, and as a result, they become extremely defensive, they seek safety in liquid investments like bonds, gold or cash
  - The 4 options policymakers have for dealing with the depression
    - They are typically slow to react initially because they don&amp;#39;t want to bail out the people who got themselves into problems
    - Austerity – Usually the most obvious thing to do. But it doesn&amp;#39;t bring the debt and income into balance. Government revenues fall and demands for government services rise which cause deficits to rise and subsequent rise in taxes. All this is bad
    - &amp;quot;QE&amp;quot; or Printing Money – The moves come in progressively larger doses as more modest initial attempts to rectify the imbalances fail. However, those early efforts typically produce bear market rallies
    - Debt defaults/Restructurings – You have to clean out the bad debt so the flow of money can continue to return to prosperity.
    - Redistribute the Wealth – Wealth gaps increase during bubbles and they become glaring during the hard times. Political populism tends to take hold after this time period. Taxes on the rich become common talking points. Central bank purchases of assets disproportionally help the rich
    - Stocks usually fall 50%
    - Currency devaluation will usually be 50% against gold
    - Deficits widen to 6% of GDP
    - Economic activity falls about 10%
    - Unemployment is 10-15%
    - Aggressive stimulation usually occurs about 2-3 years into a depression
-	The &amp;quot;Beautiful Deleveraging&amp;quot;
  - Happens when the policymakers move the 4 levers in a balanced way
  - Printing money during this phase doesn&amp;#39;t necessarily cause inflation. It won&amp;#39;t if its offsets falling credit and the deflationary forces. If income is growing faster than debt, you will be ok. However, if debt is growing faster than income, you can have a problem.
  - But central bankers can abuse the stimulative policy&amp;#39;s and cause a &amp;quot;ugly inflationary deleveraging&amp;quot; IE – Weimer Germany in the 1920&amp;#39;s
  - Printing money and debt monetization/government guarantees are inevitable in depressions in which interest rate cuts won&amp;#39;t work (IE – Already at 0%)
  - All the deleveraging eventually led to big waves of money creation, fiscal deficits, and currency devaluations (against gold, commodities, and stocks)
  - In the end, policy makers always print money because it is the easiest
    - Austerity causes more pain than benefit
    - Big restructuring wipes out too much wealth too fast
    - Redistributing of sufficient size doesn&amp;#39;t happen without a revolution
-	Pushing on a string phase
  - Late in the cycle, the policy makers have to be careful because their stimulative policies effects have diminished.
  - Economy usually enters a low growth and low return of assets
  - The danger of this phase is that too much money printing and subsequent devaluation can cause a &amp;quot;ugly inflationary deleveraging&amp;quot; to occur
    - Monetary Policy 1
      - Usually try to lower interest rates first. If that doesn&amp;#39;t work, they go to 2
    - Monetary Policy 2
      - &amp;quot;QE&amp;quot; or printing money and buying financial assets. But over time, QE&amp;#39;s ability to stimulate the market is reduced as asset prices are high and risk premiums are low. IE – investors don&amp;#39;t want to buy expensive assets that are projected to have low returns. Investors move into cash for protection which makes further QE less and less effective
      - Sometimes at this phase, policy makers monetize debt in even larger quantities in an attempt to compensate for QE reduced effectiveness. This may provide a short-term boost but there is a real risk that prolonged monetization will lead people to question the currency&amp;#39;s suitability as a store of value. This can cause investors to rush to safe havens like Gold
      - At some point, low interest rates and low premiums on risk assets from monetary policy 2 don&amp;#39;t work anymore and policy makers look to Monetary Policy 3 to stimulate the economy
    - Monetary Policy 3 – Where the US is at in 2020
      - Puts money directly into the hands of spenders instead of investors/savers and incentivizes them to spend it
      - Government provides direct or indirect stimulus payments in many different forms
-	Normalization
  - System gets back to normal. But this usually takes 5-10 years and economic activity is slow during this time frame. And it takes investors a very long time to get comfortable taking the risk of holding equities again

# **Inflationary Depression**

-	Reserve currency countries that don&amp;#39;t have significant foreign currency debt can have inflationary depressions, they usually emerge more slowly and later in the process, after sustained and repeated overuse of stimulus to reverse a deflationary deleveraging.
-	If a reserve-currency country permits much higher inflation in order to keep growth stronger by printing lots of money, it can further undermine demand for the currency, erode its reserve currency status (IE make investors view it less as a store of wealth) and turn its deleveraging into an inflationary one",finance
stocks,Ray Dalio Principles of Navigating Big Debt Crises Summary Part 2,"# **Classic Inflationary Debt Cycle**

-	Countries with the worst debt problems, a lot of debt denominated in a foreign currency, and a high dependence on foreign capital typically have severe currency weakness. This currency weakness is what causes inflations when there is a depression
-	Inflationary Depression can happen to any country but are most likely if
  - Don&amp;#39;t have reserve currency
  - Have low foreign exchange reserves
  - Have large foreign debt
  - Have large and increasing budget and/or deficit
  - Have negative real interest rates
  - History of high inflation
-	5 Stages of debt cycle. Follow the deflationary cycle until the depression stage
  - Early – Low debt levels. Productive Investments. Attraction of foreign capital due to investment returns. Usually enter into a foreign exchange market to sell their currency for the incoming foreign currency to prevent it from rising and keep their exports attractive.
  - Bubble – Good asset returns, strong capital inflows, and strong economic conditions create a self-reinforcing cycle. But debts are rising faster than incomes. Asset prices are bid up and increasingly financed by debt. Country becomes the &amp;quot;hot&amp;quot; place to invest and investors who were never involved want in which sets the country up for a reversal. Country becomes reliant on debt and foreign capital rather than productivity for gains. Stocks might average 20% per year for several years during this phase
  - Top – Bubble bursts. The inflows of capital which caused the bubble are reversed. Asset prices fall, interest rates rise and banks fail. Could come from some type of shock like a reduction in oil prices. Worry increases on the part of both asset/currency holders and policymakers who are trying to support the currency. Investors worry about their ability to get their money out which causes them to get it out while they still can
    - Central bankers first make bold statements about defending the currency
    - Central banks then try to defend their currencies but these rarely work
      - Spending down reserves
      - Raising rates
    - Last line of defense before they give up is to install capital controls which never works
  - Depression – Policy makers stop fighting and let the currency decline. A gradual and persistent currency decline causes the market to expect continued future currency depreciation which isn&amp;#39;t good. Most countries do a one-off devaluation so it catches the market off guard. Policy makers usually say they will continue to defend the currency right up until they don&amp;#39;t. After policy makers let the currency go, people push to get their money out of the currency.
    - Usually, 30% decline in the currency
    - 50% fall in equities in local currency and even worse in foreign currency
  - Normalization – Supply demand balance return. Typically takes investors a few years to return (2-3). But the price of domestic goods and labor fell with the currency making it an attractive investment for foreign investors, which helps growth

# **Hyperinflation**

-	If countries continue to prop up growth rather than bring spending in line with income. And this is done repeatedly over the years, a hyperinflation episode can result
-	Inflation psychology sets in with the public. Currency declines inspire additional flight, which causes a feedback loop
-	People totally lose faith in the currency as a store of value
-	How to invest during a hyperinflation episode – Short the currency, get your money out of the country, buy commodities (Gold), and invest in commodity industries (Gold, Oil, etc)",finance
personalfinance,Cash out refinance question - does it make sense for me?,"I am wondering if a cash-out refinance makes sense. Here is my situation:

* I am 5 years into a mortgage. I have  $228,00 remaining on the $257,000 loan. My monthly payments are $1,900 (I have PMI insurance). My interest rate is 4.250. Our home has gone up roughly $200,000 in value. 
* I have $10k in high-interest credit card debt. 
* I have a $10k first-time homeowner loan that I need to payoff before refinancing. 
* I have $10k of home improvements that need to be made (sewer issue). 

I am considering doing a cash-out refinance for $30,000. I would use this money to immediately pay for the things listed above. The loan would be 30 years at 3.5% with $4k in closing costs. I would pay the closing costs immediately. My monthly payment would fall to $1,650. 

Additionally, we will probably sell our house within the next 2 years. 

I suspect refinancing may not be wise long term, but I need the $10k for the sewer issue (I am reluctant to dip into my small amount of emergency funds). In addition, we only have the 1 credit card and I would love to eliminate it. So, while it may not be the wisest long term decision, is it a disastrous decision?",finance

If the China-commercial paper connection pans out, it is a house of cards ready to collapse. If you are smart, you will get away while you still can.","You have been hearing Tether FUD for years, and I have been following the events closely. However, things have heated up to critical mass beyond anything the market has seen before. Here's the recent timeline.

1. (March 2021)New York Attorney General settled a case against Tether &amp;amp; Bitfinex for ""losing"" $850 million of customer funds and misrepresenting their 1 to 1 financial backing. [https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/the-new-york-attorney-general-s-office-9385268/](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/the-new-york-attorney-general-s-office-9385268/)
2. May 2021 - under pressure, Tether reveals the majority of its currency reserves are not cash, but rather in the form of unknown ""commercial paper"". They do not reveal the counterparties to this paper. [https://www.coindesk.com/tether-first-reserve-composition-report-usdt](https://www.coindesk.com/tether-first-reserve-composition-report-usdt)
3. June 2021 - The FED called Tether a threat to the stability of US financial markets, expects future regulations. [https://www.coindesk.com/us-fed-official-calls-tether-a-challenge-to-financial-stability](https://www.coindesk.com/us-fed-official-calls-tether-a-challenge-to-financial-stability)
4. July 2021 - The DOJ has taken up an investigation against Tether executives for possible Bank Fraud. This appears to be new case, investigating years old allegations that Tether execs concealed their connection to various bank deposits. ([https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/26/doj-reportedly-probes-crypto-company-tether-for-possible-bank-fraud.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/26/doj-reportedly-probes-crypto-company-tether-for-possible-bank-fraud.html)).
5. July 27th 2021 - Elizabeth Warren writes a letter to US Sec Treasury Janet Yellen, urging immediate regulation against cryptocurrency, particularly focusing on stablecoins like Tether.
6. July 27th 2021 - Bloomberg reports that federal regulators are investigating into Tether's financial reserves, focusing on the issued commercial
paper. [https://cointelegraph.com/news/regulators-scrutinizing-tether-s-commercial-paper-reserves-comptroller-of-the-currency](https://cointelegraph.com/news/regulators-scrutinizing-tether-s-commercial-paper-reserves-comptroller-of-the-currency)

Meanwhile, China financial markets are in freefall with a wave of regulations from the CCP. Those regulations extend to over-leveraged property development companies who have been issuing $billions of dollars in commercial paper in exchange for liquidity. China's new regulation was that those developers begin disclosing the commercial paper debt every month. [https://www.reuters.com/business/china-order-developers-disclose-commercial-paper-debt-every-month-sources-2021-07-16/](https://www.reuters.com/business/china-order-developers-disclose-commercial-paper-debt-every-month-sources-2021-07-16/)

About the same time the regulatory crackdowns began, Tether stopped printing. The market cap remains flat. [https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tether/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tether/)

Tether execs have not as of yet disclosed the source of their commercial paper, nor have they denied that it is foreign debt.

Tether has also long since been discovered to be a centerpiece for Chinese money laundering operations. [https://www.coindesk.com/tether-usdt-russia-china-importers](https://www.coindesk.com/tether-usdt-russia-china-importers?ref=hackernoon.com#attachment_412074) . Chinese investors (or criminals) buy Tether through OTC markets and shell corps. Then they move the money overseas to reinvest in foreign real estate markets. This is not ""conspiracy"", this is proven fact.

All of the pieces add up, and it is too hard to ignore. Tether is a powder keg. 

There is a very real chance that Tether is at the center of an offshore shadow-banking industry. And if that pans out, regulators are poised to bust the doors wide open.

There is also a very real chance that Tether's commercial paper is in the form of extremely high risk chinese-debt, that cannot be easily redeemed for USD, and is in fact at risk of seizure from the Chinese government.

If that happens, Tether WILL come unpegged, and you will be left holding the bag if you're holding any of it. Tether is the backbone to a huge majority of exchange-traded liquidity, as well as fuel for the DEFI market. If that balloon bursts, it is going to trigger the mother of all shakeups for the Crypto markets.

Is this FUD? Yes it is. But I am happy to hear and discuss any counterarguments. My 2C. If you're smart you'll run as far away from Tether as you can get.",cryptocurrency

[https://stakehound.com/blog-post/fireblocks-eth-2-key-management-incident/](https://stakehound.com/blog-post/fireblocks-eth-2-key-management-incident/) [https://twitter.com/JamesSpediacci/status/1407465311180255236](https://twitter.com/JamesSpediacci/status/1407465311180255236)

20. COTI (a project with very close ties to Cardano) is coming to Ledger. [https://medium.com/cotinetwork/coti-native-is-coming-to-ledger-c56b04df1253](https://medium.com/cotinetwork/coti-native-is-coming-to-ledger-c56b04df1253)
21. The June Cardano 360 is currently available on Youtube. [https://youtu.be/al5m14299ww](https://youtu.be/al5m14299ww)
22. We saw segments on various newer partner entities like Nervos, Orion Protocol, and Revuto. Nervos is a UTXO proof-of-work blockchain which is building a cross-chain bridge with Cardano so that you can use your ADA on Nervos dApps and vice versa. Interoperability is a big theme for Nervos and they plan to have a working testnet within a month. Orion Protocol is building a terminal that will allow for decentralized non-custodial trading across centralized and decentralized exchanges. They say this would not require you to KYC or even have an account with any of these exchanges. Revuto is an online subscription management service that recently completed a $10MM token sale on Cardano.
23. It was also revealed that Wolfram Labs, COTI, and IOHK have a three-way partnership (a ménage à tech) to build an NFT auction site. The people from Wolfram were talking about very interesting things including live minting during streaming events and automated upload to IPFS. COTI will be building out auction and bidding mechanisms in ADAPay.
24. Professor Aggelos Kiayias gave us an update on research including that Ouroboros Chronos and Hydra papers have both been accepted into conferences/journals. Chronos will provide Cardano with a global concept of time that doesn’t rely on any outside timekeeper. Prof. Kiayias also pointed out that Hydra is distinguishable from other layer two protocols in that the scripting language is identical to that of the base layer in Cardano such that any dApp that can run on Cardano will run on the Hydra L2. This is a huge plus and superior to many other layer two solutions in other ecosystems where the base layer dApps will not run on layer two. Finally, the Mithril paper has been submitted for peer review. It will provide Cardano light wallets with Succinct Non-interactive Arguments of Knowledge that will give us the best of both worlds: no delays for syncing as in full node wallets while still preserving trustlessness.
25. Finally, the Goguen Summit will be in late September. Sign up now at [summit.cardano.org](http://summit.cardano.org/).
26. The Fed is once again STRONGLY signalling to us that they are going to regulate stablecoins. The Fed is also specifically calling out Tether for the first time. You need to be thinking about how stablecoin regulation might affect your favorite Cardano DeFi or other project. [https://twitter.com/CaitlinLong\_/status/1408500265397985282](https://twitter.com/CaitlinLong_/status/1408500265397985282) [https://twitter.com/CaitlinLong\_/status/1408572624125534212](https://twitter.com/CaitlinLong_/status/1408572624125534212)
27. People are starting to realize that the Stakehound private key loss in ETH may attract unwanted regulatory attention to Ethereum 2.0 while this problem could never have occurred in Cardano. Also, only a few days later another ETH stakepool (this time SharedStake...the sixth biggest ETH Stakepool) allegedly experiences a rugpull that some are valuing at over $30MM. This is another problem that could not happen in Cardano staking. It feels like we stepped into the ring, they rang the bell, and ETH just started punching itself in the head. Eventually it’s going to KO itself.

42. Robert Kornacki of dcSpark releases an article on why every Cardano dApp will use NFTs. The article contains some very interesting discussion on smart contracts in the EUTXO context including language instructing that “UTXOs have smart contracts attached to them and not the other way around” and “\[...\]the simplest way to think about it is that when a UTXO is created it has the option to have a smart contract attached to it.” [https://medium.com/dcspark/every-eutxo-dapp-will-use-nfts-and-heres-why-fd87e6a8c9a6](https://medium.com/dcspark/every-eutxo-dapp-will-use-nfts-and-heres-why-fd87e6a8c9a6)

In news that could have significant repercussions for many stablecoin reliant Cardano DeFi projects, Fed Chair Jerome Powell gave some hard signals that they will regulate stablecoins in House Committee testimony. He revealed that the Fed will issue its long-awated paper on stablecoins, CBDCs, and other digital assets in September. Powell also went as far as to say ""You wouldn't need stable coins you wouldn't need cryptocurrencies if you had a digital US currency, I think that's one of the stronger arguments in its favor.""

85. The El Faro article reporting meetings between Cardano, Whizgrid of Cyprus, and the brothers of President Bukele of El Salvador definitely contain some extremely interesting details related to a possible Salvadorean national stablecoin by the end of the year and a possible digitization and blockchain storage of a wide range of government related documents next year.

88. Notable news for upcoming Cardano DeFi projects. There may be slightly less competition in the “get a return on your crypto assets” game very soon. The New Jersey AG’s office has delivered a cease and desist letter to BlockFi. The AG’s press release cited BlockFi’s interest bearing deposit accounts as unregistered securities and also mentioned the lack of FDIC or SPIC insurance for it’s depositors. This leaves some lingering questions for Cardano DeFi projects that might be planning to accept deposits or other transfers of value and offering a return of sorts. You could argue that these projects are decentralized where BlockFi was not. But, the AG’s press release seems to cite decentralization as one of the risks of DeFi projects. Also, as a practical matter, there is a question whether decentralization will be a good shield from regulators since many of these projects have companies and real humans with faces and names behind them unlike a truly anonymous founder such as Satoshi Nakamoto.

90. Cardano didn’t come up in the Cathie Wood, Jack Dorsey, and Elon Musk panel discussion at “The B Word” event. But, given how Elon repeatedly shot down maximalist explanations for the shortcomings of proof-of-work chains in energy consumption and throughput, the whole thing ended up sounding like a long-form pitch for proof-of-stake and Cardano.

However, in the longer term, coupled with the risk of resurgence in virus infection due to new strains of Covid, policymakers will be very cautious about removing policy accommodation too soon. 

Later today, the Federal Reserve will announce its policy decision and Fed Chair Powell, in his post-meeting press conference, will likely stick to the script that inflation is transitory and the tapering process will be very transparent and well-telegraphed.

personalfinance,Advice on an FHA Refi,"I’ve talked to a number of friends and connections in real estate and lending, but I’m just looking for as much possible input in order to make the best decision. I’m new to home buying and loan intricacies. 

I bought my first home a year ago on an FHA. $340K brand new. Interest is at 2.75. 

Here’s where I’m going back and forth. 

On one hand, it seems like there’s little downside to a refinance to a conventional. I’ll need to refi eventually anyways to get PMI to fall off, and with the current state of the market, that equity could get me closer (although unlikely all the way) to 20% equity. It seems like I should refi asap in terms of where interest rates and home values are at (next door neighbor bought 18 months ago for around 310 and just sold for 415.

At the same time, we bought in this area knowing it will appreciate regardless of the current inflation. We bought early in a new development. Prime area. Still a couple thousand homes, including shopping/restaurants/etc. to be built. Even when/if the market corrects, we are expecting solid appreciation in the next 3-5 years. 

Is the potential 5-10k on closing a new loan not worth refinancing on a young loan with a 2.75 interest rate? Seems like we could see some solid equity put in, but the interest rate we have locked right now seems hard to let go of. 

Any thoughts are helpful.",finance

CryptoCurrency,Bitcoin miners return to profit with 180% surge in revenue over the last 30 days,"Despite increased regulatory crackdown and volatility, Bitcoin miners are finding their way back to profitability. Data indicates that as Bitcoin builds momentum, the mining revenue has increased, although the profit is still dwarfed by figures recorded early this year. 

Data indicates that the Bitcoin mining revenue surged 179.4% over the last 30 days. On June 27, miners earned $13.06 million, while on July 26, the figure was $36.49 million. Cumulatively, the revenue for the 30 days stood at $841 million. 

Elsewhere, the revenue for the last 30 days represents a drop of 51.47% compared to the $1.7 billion earnings between March 27 and April 26. During this period, Bitcoin was still on a bull run powered by investments from institutions. Furthermore, as of December 2020, miners earned $1.2 billion. Data on Bitcoin mining revenue is provided by [Blockchain.com](https://Blockchain.com)

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/x0pj45c9zxd71.png?width=1844&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c76154d1fd7ac3516a37446c7bedfe929f6836e6

## Drivers for increasing Bitcoin revenue

The Bitcoin mining revenue surge for the past 30 days comes when the cryptocurrency is still experiencing episodes of high volatility. Towards the end of June, the mining revenue remained low, correlating with Bitcoin's price that was slightly trading at around $30,000. Elsewhere, the revenue has surged amid Bitcoin's resurgence in recent days with eyes on the $40,000 mark. Over the same period, Bitcoin's price has gained by 13%. 

Historically, when the price of Bitcoin plunges, interest in the asset also declines; hence miners have fewer transactions to confirm. For instance, the surge in the revenue between March and April correlated with the cryptocurrency's sustained bull run as more people attempted to get involved, mainly driven by the fear of missing out. During this period, Bitcoin attained an all-time high price of almost $65,000 in mid-April. 

Furthermore, the increasing mining revenue occurred in an environment of significant change in the sector. With Chinese authorities increasingly cracking down on the activity, the country's dominance in mining began to fade. The crackdown in China saw authorities term Bitcoin as a threat to financial stability. 

Consequently, authorities in regions dominated by mining like Inner Mongolia [proposed](https://qz.com/2013354/chinas-inner-mongolia-issues-tough-rules-on-bitcoin-mining/) new strict regulations to govern the exercise. However, other jurisdictions like North America and several Asian countries have increased mining investment. Notably, some of the miners from China have been relocating to friendly jurisdictions. Additionally, the mining revenue increased amid an interesting dynamic where most of the hash power went offline, resulting in high costs due to logistics. 

## The future of Bitcoin mining 

Based on the recent Bitcoin price movement, the mining revenue is encouraging, considering that the sector has also experienced a general decline in profitability over recent years. However, with the regulatory crackdown on mining and the carbon footprint concerns, the industry risks losing this year's gains.

However, there is hope for the sector, considering that most operators are now focusing on using renewable energy to mine Bitcoin. This is backed by the Bitcoin Mining Council. Under the council's inaugural report, about 56% of Bitcoin mining relies on renewable energy.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Cay buying: given lower rate only if I buy GAP insurance?,"Bought a car from a dealership for the first time yesterday, and thought I had prepared myself and done my research pretty well before going in, but I was not prepared for a really hard push over GAP insurance.

I came in with a pre-approval from my CU for 3.75, which seemed high but I wanted to see something on paper before going in. I'm putting 5k down on a car with an OTD price of 28,500 (72 month loan, I don't plan on taking all that time to pay it off).  Finance guy looks at my credit (above 700) and says he can get it down to 3.5, excellent. Then he starts showing me paper with a series of monthly payments above what I expected (450-411 vs 366ish), and these are prices with GAP insurance, which I ""need, everyone gets it."" I decline, saying 366 is what I can pay. He gets really ruffled, insinuates I am stupid calls me reckless, seems more bothered that I just keep blinking at him and say ""no, 366 is where I feel comfortable.""

10 minute silent standoff while he types on the computer. ""Oh! Looks like the bank came back with a 3.1% rate IF you get the basic GAP insurance. And this covers new tires, oil changes, etc. for the first two years."" (**Edit:** yes, the GAP packages presented were bundled with warranties, which I guess is to make it more confusing/palatable to someone like me prepared to say no to warranties alone). Now he shows me a new number - the monthly rate with that same basic GAP insurance that was 411 before is now 372, making it a whole 6 dollars more than the amount I was about to sign for. That seemed reasonable, but in the back of my mind I figured the 3.1% rate option must have been there the whole time and he was holding it in his back pocket to push the GAP. Would a bank have any incentive to offer a lower rate with GAP insurance (this was his claim)? Seems like that might make sense with a 0% down payment, and I know I didn't put down a lot, but it all left a bitter taste. Car is a lightly used Toyota, state is Florida.

Did I get swindled here?

**Edit: Yep, the GAP + fun warranty items was totally swindling. Going to go through my contract today and see if I can cancel the GAP and get that 14/month removed from my payment and keep the 3.1% interest rate. If it ends up being illegal to tie rates to add-ons, I am going to report. Thank you all so much.**  


**Edit2: GAP insurance is cancelable! There are a couple reviews on BBB from the dealership about refund checks not being received (and hard sells on it to begin with) but all are addressed by dealer and everyone who complained got their check. Should have checked BBB on dealership first. All in all, once this headache is over, I am glad I got this car at this price in a time where buying a car is hell. Armed better for next time, which hopefully is 15 years from now and hopefully a different climate (like maybe totally online and without being called names by a pushy finance jerk).**",finance

personalfinance,Is it too early to request a raise?,"Hi everyone! 

So I recently got a job approx. 3 months ago at a hospital. I am currently still in college and have been working about 30 hours a week over the summer, and I am planning to continue this when my last semester of college starts at the end of August. 

All of the other people that work the same position as me are also students and many of them either aren't working at all next semester or work very little compared to me. I also take way more on-call (which is somewhat optional, you need to take call, but not a ton, just enough to cover the schedule with everyone) than any of them. I make the same amount of money as them and it seems to me personally that I either work as effectively, if not more than them. I am always willing to help, even when some things don't exactly meet my job description (ex. data entry on slower days). 

I made sure to leave open availability because we are becoming understaffed when school starts. But if I'm working more than everyone else and being more reliable and effective at the job, I just don't understand wanting to wait until I hit the 6-month mark before requesting a raise. I get along with everyone for the most part. There was a situation with an older woman that I reported to my supervisor because we have different job descriptions and she complained that I wasn't helping her do her job while I was already extremely busy. It was a bit of a mess honestly but I'm not gonna get into details. Following that, we actually made a new organization system for patient rooms. However, I did tell my main manager about how she threatened me (unknowingly, but I was in a patient room and she was talking to a friend) and how if this is going to be happening, I don't get paid nearly enough to deal with it although I love this job, and I know I'm good at my job. 

So long story short, should I still wait until I hit the 6-month mark, or maybe should I wait another month until the other students leave/cut down hours dramatically? I'm making about the same as I was when I worked my previous job, which is $10, about $1.50 over minimum wage.  I also have a certification as a medical assistant, and while it is actually relevant since I work in patient care, I am not an MA. Just curious for your thoughts! Thanks :)",finance

CryptoCurrency,Bitcoin may not only be the purest form of money but also the purest form of ownership.,"Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies are not meant to be just a better way to get you a pack of gum, it's meant to be a better way to do money.

Money evolved from barter, to a symbol of barter. In China for instance, where the early money was born, instead of trading axes, they started trading symbols for axes. Which became a form of IOU, and this is how the debt-based money system was born.

But there were several flaws.

Like fiat today, those debt based systems all relied on promises. Nowadays it relies on promises from financial reserves and governments. It even literally says it's a promise on many of the fiat notes:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/0lgh2vdhtyd71.jpg?width=998&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5d28419e807434402f579afbd3d99ba24df329c6

You have to trust that they will keep those promises, back those notes, and that regime is solid enough.

What if you didn't have to rely on promises anymore?

A system that takes out trust out of the equation, or even the need for any notes or anything physical.

Money was never really about physical coins and notes. The Sumerians understood that early on. The whole banking system only really needs the ledger, a system that records what everyone has and all the transactions.

&amp;#x200B;

[The tablet explains that a debtor will repay the lender 330 measures of grains on harvest day.](https://preview.redd.it/lzeixcbptyd71.jpg?width=522&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=847b7e53e21a723525c0373141a0f1ba96ae2a4b)

This was the start of the banking system. Which will later be used similarly during the Renaissance for the first modern banks in Italy. Because the part that really matters in the end, is the ledger.

And you can see it now with digital banking. When you transfer money on your banking app, there's no actual physical money involved. You don't have a Wells Fargo trucks transferring cash from your branch, and delivering it to the account of the person you're transferring it to. It's all just done digitally by recording the transactions, who owes what, and who has what.

Even the federal reserve isn't just printing paper money, they're just adding numbers on a computer now, and digitally add that number to banks, borrowers, and treasury bonds.

Bitcoin is essentially what money should have always been. A ledger that doesn't rely on trust, promises, and is independent from corruption. It's money that gives its user independence, and pure ownership.

There is only one rule of ownership in Bitcoin, whoever owns the private key owns the coins. No one else. And there's no administration that can overrule this. It doesn't matter if you are 10 years old, if you are poor, if you have no citizenship, if your country outlaws Bitcoin, if your government falls, if you have the key, your ownership is absolute.

Something not many assets truly give you. Even real estate is tied to a lot of conditions for your ownership, from laws to liens. You have to trust that the administration handing you your deed and recognizing it, is a legitimate administration. Not a government giving you stolen land. And you have to trust that this administration isn't going to fall and be replaced, putting your ownership in question.

solar,Western NC Solar Project,"So I've been considering solar for the longest time and now I've got some contractors involved. So far it's only been RENU. More quotes will be coming in next week.

Some background:

My last 12 month's consumption was \~18,000 kwh.

Within the next 3 years we'll be: 

* Adding a Cybertruck to the driveway
* Converting an out building into an in-law cabin, complete with it's own 100A circuit.
* Finishing the basement
* Expanding the house into the garage space

&amp;#x200B;

Knowing this the quote I got was for a 19.21kw REC panel system with an estimated production of \~23,000 kwh. Powerwalls were considered but RENU wants $17.8k for the 1st and $12k for the 2nd. No... no way. Not now. Maybe when Tesla and RENU have dropped prices and supply has caught up with demand.

 Presently my monthly bill to Duke is \~$185 because I use their 'average billing' feature that smooths out your monthly payments. 

My understanding is that NC does net metering at retail rates but will only hold onto surplus as credits. I'm also factoring in a $4k incentive from Duke Power and the 26% Federal tax credit.

I'm having a call with the RENU rep soon but by my numbers come out to \~$170 a month for a 20 year finance at 3%. Not bad, not bad. Plenty of energy to play with, and my monthly out of pocket doesn't change.",energy

personalfinance,Why Real Estate vs. Index Funds is so polarizing: a tale of two rentals.,"I have been on this sub for a while and recently saw quite a few threads arguing about RE vs. Index, which is the better investment strategy. So I have decided to share my personal experience in this matter and I think my example is a good illustration of why this topic is so polarizing. I apologize in advance as this is somewhat of a long post 

The story begins towards the end of 2017, after seeing the big fat cut Uncle Sam took from our W2s, the missus gave me a mandate, ""DO SOMETHING about this tax thing"" (exactly her words). So I started talking to our accountant at the time and found out that besides pumping out another kid, the only option left would be to increase our mortgage interest. Our personal home was bought with a much high down payment than the usual 20%, and we were on a 15-year mortgage. The account suggests that we should just refi our mortgage to the maximum allowed for tax deduction (750K), and use the cash out to do some investing. After some calculations, the cash out would net us around 150K. So, after some discussion with the missus, we decided to go for it. 

After receiving our cash out of 150K at end of Jan 2018, we started our journey. At the time my thoughts were that either we invest it in index funds, or we invest it in real estate. I chose to invest in real estate because that's what I always wanted to get into. So I started researching, we live in a VHCOL city, and 150K for a 20% down payment can only land us a pretty average condo in where we live. So I decided to expand out, and at the time I figured 2 hr driving distance is the max I am willing to travel to. I also did more research to form my real estate investment strategy. I came up with: 1) only entry-level SFH without HOA, 2) at least 3 beds 2 baths, 3) high rent to price ratio, 4) city with growth. 

With this strategy, I checked every city and suburb within the 2 hr driving distance from where we lived and landed in a city about 45mins to an hr away. At the time, the average house that fits our criteria there is around 300K to 400K, so I was like sweet, I can get two rentals instead of one for my 150K. I picked a local realtor, and the search was on, about two weeks later, we got our first offer accepted, and about 3 weeks after that the 2nd offer landed as well. 

We should call these two properties Rental A and Rental B. Both are 4/2s, both have similar sq ft, but A is in the middle of the city, prime location, and B is in the outskirts of the city but has twice the land.  A closed at 360K (72K down), and B closed at 365K (73K down), so the two properties started out in pretty much the same spot in numbers. At the time I felt that we landed A at around market price, and B at a discount due to the land size. Both properties were move-in ready, so we really didn't do much except cleaning before renting them out. Start from the beginning I wanted to hire a property management company, since we are newbies to this whole thing, and we really don't have time to handle the day-to-day. Our agent recommended us a management company, and we checked their reviews online and decided to go with them. We were actually pretty lucky in that we rented out both units just days after closing (it is a great rental market, and that was the main reason I picked this city).  

So below I will list out the numbers in detail, up to March 2021, I will explain why this date later. (I try to include everything I can think of, but if I missed something please feel free to let me know).

--- COST ---
Mortgage: Both houses are financed on 20% down, 4.6% interest to start. I did, however, refi both places in 2020 to 3.6% interest rate (I know I know, I jumped the gun too early, should have waited a few more months). Pulling all the numbers from my amortization schedule
A) $52,090.98
B) $51,340.08

Financing closing cost: $6000 for each (initial plus the refi in 2020)

Property Taxes: again pulling from city records.  
A) $12,813.00 
B) $12,993.00.

Insurance (Landlord Policy): $600 per year, or $1800 total for both. 

Warranty: $500 per year, or $1500 total for both. (I am slowly coming to the idea that warranty is not so great)

Maintenance: small ticket items are covered by the warranty, so only big stuff here.
A) New roof ($5000), and new fence ($2500), all happened this year, I knew that going in the house needed new roof and fence, so this was expected, the only mistake was waiting till this year, as the material cost were through the roof. 

B) Brand new HVAC ($6000), the HVAC was not working upon inspection, tried talking to the seller and he told my agent to ""Suck it up and grow a pair, bitch"" (exactly his words). So we had to eat this cost. 

I also tag along $1000 for misc cost for each house, but in reality, this should be much lower.

Finder Fee: the property manager includes one time $450 finders fee for each new tenant.
A) 3 tenants, total $1350
B) 1 tenant, total $450 

--- INCOME ---
Rent: Rent was pretty consistent, rental A had 3 tenants, but it's one after another, so the total vacancy is around one month. We also got lucky with one of the tenants being an insurance tenant, and they paid double the rent during their short two-month stay. Rental B only had one tenant ever. We did do a 5% rent increase every year, but we did not raise the rent during the pandemic. Also, fortunately, our tenants never stopped paying rent during the pandemic as well. The management company charges a 7% management fee monthly, so the numbers here are after the fees.
A) $69,099.00  
B) $69,192.00 

Equity: again, pulling numbers from the amortization schedule.
A) $15,001.15 
B) $14,803.42 
  
--- Capital Gain ---
Here is where the number gets fuzzy because I still own both places. According to Zillow, A is at  $513,000.00 in March 2021, and B is at $561,900.00 in March 2021, Redfin has both of them at higher numbers. I did talk to my agent, and he confirmed that the way people are bidding in that area, both places will sell way over whatever Zillow/redfin estimates are. But, I did do a cash-out refi on both properties in March 2021 (this is to finance the expansion of my rental portfolio), the appraisal by the bank came back at A) $480,000.00 and B) $550,000.00. So to be conservative, I will be using these numbers for this exercise. 

--- Return Calculation ---
Now, remember, we started with A) $72,000.00 and B) $73,000.00 of cash. If we add up all the capital gains and income, subtracting the costs, we will get 66.73% return for A, and 157.41% return for B. However, just to be more precise, let's tag on a theoretical 6% closing cost to the mix (selling index fund has no closing cost, but selling houses does). By this calculation, the return for A is only 26.73%, and return for B is 112.21%. Now, if I invested this total of $145,000.00 back in Mar 2018 all into VTI, I should be getting a 47.14% return.  
 
--- Side Note on time spent ---
This is not included in the calculation of the return, but I still want to include it here. This whole process takes time, and time is valuable too. I probably spent 1.5 months doing researching, looking at houses, closing, etc. But since I have a property manager, I barely spent time on the rentals afterward. I can probably count the number of email exchanges I have had with my PM in two hands. The number of times I visited that city after I closed the properties is zero. I spend 5 minutes every month checking on the summary and deposit that the PM sends me, and that's pretty much it. 

--- Conclusion ---
Looking at my conservative estimates, rental A underperformed the index, while rental B outperformed the index. I think, the reason that RE vs Index is so polarizing is precisely because there is soooo much variance in RE investments. I have two properties, in the same city, bought with the same price, and yet the return was vastly different. Imagine people's experiences in different cities, states, or even countries. Another reason is access. If I recommend someone to invest in VTI, anyone living in US can do it in a heartbeat, but if I recommend someone to invest in RE, it's going to really depend on the person's location. Not everyone is willing to travel outside the state, or even outside the city they live in. With index, everyone is playing the same game, but with RE, the game is different for everyone.",finance

defi,Best DeFi Route for Getting USD from a grab bag of Crypto Collateral?,"Hi Everyone!

I'm sure there are many good ways in Defi to do this, but my head is spinning with all the possible options and I'm totally lost, so I'm turning to you Defi geniuses to help me pull my head out of my ass and give me some guidance...

I'm trying to pull together about $100k in USD, and I've got more than that in crypto, but I don't want to just cash it all out because that would lead to a bunch of taxes for capital gains.

I've got 5+ BTC, 20+ ETH, 30k Tether, and a potpourri of other cryptos like LINK, LTC, etc. (this is a throwaway account, or else I wouldn't put in actual amounts).

In the past I've used Nexo for USD loans, but recently they took 2 months to process a 2 BTC deposit, so that's opened my eyes to the fact that maybe DeFi is less risky than CeFi (in some ways at least) so I'm trying to explore my DeFi options.

For the exit into USD, I'm assuming that I'll use Coinbase, so I guess I'm trying to figure out the best options for getting a good stable coin loan.

Other details I'm wondering about are things like...

• What is the best way to collateralize a DeFi loan to minimize liquidation?

• Is there a combination of platforms I can use to a) get the best rate on the stablecoin loan, and then b) stake additional crypto to reduce the effective interest rate of that original loan?

• If I have enough collateral, should I consider taking out more than $100k in stable coin loans, since I might be able then get 10% - 15% interest on the extra stable coin funds that I don't need?

• Are there platforms with the option to buy insurance to protect against counterparty risk / contract bugs?

THANK YOU so much for any insights you can provide!

I know there are probably a million ways to do this, so if you -- knowing way more than me -- can even just throw out the approach that you'd personally take, that's super helpful in itself.",cryptocurrency

financialindependence,Why Real Estate vs. Index Funds is so polarizing: a tale of two rentals.,"EDIT: Wow! I am extremely humbled and gracious of all your enthusiasm in this topic. Thanks for everyone who stopped by and read the post and joined the conversation. Again, the idea for this post was to highlight the variance on the returns of RE investment vs. index fund, definitely not advocating one vs. the other.

# **The Black Swan**

-	3 attributes for a black swan
  - A black swan is an outlier, as in outside the realm of regular expectations
  - Carries extreme impact
  - Human nature makes us concoct explanations for its occurrence _ **after** _ the fact
    - Rare, Extreme Impact and Retrospective predictability
-	There are great problems with trying to forecast the future, given limited knowledge of the past
-	Black swans being unpredictable, we need to adjust to their existence rather than naively try to predict them
-	The human mind suffers from 3 ailments as it comes into contact with history
  - The illusion of understanding or how everyone thinks they know what is going on in a world that is more complicated (or random) than they realize
  - Retrospective distortion or how we assess matter only after the fact (history seems clearer and more organized in books than in empirical reality)
  - Overvaluation of factual information
-	Taleb realized that he was totally incapable of predicting market prices, but that others were just as incapable as him but did not know it or did not know that they were taking massive risks. Most traders were just picking up pennies in front of a steamroller
-	2 types of randomness analogy
  - Mediocristan – land of average
  - Extremistan – land of black swans
    - Mediocristan - When your sample is large; no single instance will significantly change the aggregate or total. The largest observation will remain impressive, but insignificant to the sum. IE – Human weights, Human heights, car accidents, IQ
      - Black swans don&amp;#39;t occur here. Once you collect enough data should reveal all you need to know and if you do have a surprise, it won&amp;#39;t be consequential. Collecting data here is ok. What you can learn from data in Mediocristan augments very rapidly with the supply of information. You can predict here.
    - Extemistan – inequalities are such that one single observation can disproportionately impact the aggregate or the total. IE – wealth, income, book sales per author, financial markets, commodity prices, inflation rates, economic data
      - Black swans do occur here. You will have trouble figuring out the average from any sample since it can depend so much on one single observation. Be suspicious of the knowledge of the data you collect here. Knowledge here grows slowly and erratically with the addition of data. Difficult or even impossible to predict.
-	Black Swan Example – Consider a turkey that is fed every day. Every single feeding will firm up the bird&amp;#39;s belief that it is the general rule of life to be fed every day by friendly humans &amp;quot;looking out for my best interests&amp;quot;. But the Wednesday before Thanksgiving something unexpected will happen to the turkey. It will occur a revision of belief. Ironically, the turkeys feeling of safety had reached a maximum when the risk was the highest.
  - The turkey had &amp;quot;learned backwards&amp;quot; from observation
  - oHow can we know the future, given finite knowledge of the past?
  - Something may have worked in the past until, well it doesn&amp;#39;t. You don&amp;#39;t drive your car looking in the rear-view mirror.
    - Before 1987, the biggest single day drop in the Dow was 13% so some people incorrectly concluded from the past that they most the Dow could drop in a day was 13%. It dropped 22% on &amp;quot;Black Monday&amp;quot;
-	Positive Black Swans take time to show their effects while negative black swans happen very quickly
-	Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence
-	Naïve Empiricism – We tend to have a tendency to look for instances that confirm our story and our vision of the world and these instances are easy to find. You take past instances that corroborate your theories and treat them as evidence.
-	Negative Empiricism - The way to counter your Naïve Empiricism is to understand that a series of corroborative facts is not _Necessarily_ evidence. Seeing White Swans does not confirm the nonexistence of Black Swans.
-	The error of confirmation - We are quick to draw conclusions from what we have seen to what is unseen.
-	Confirmation Bias – our natural tendency to look only for corroboration of our ideas.
  - To counter this George Soros was known when taking a financial bet to keep looking for evidence or instances to prove his initial theory wrong
-	Narrative Fallacy – this is associated with our vulnerability to overinterpretation and our predilection for compact stories over raw truths. It severely distorts our mental representation of the world, especially rare events
  - We tend to look at sequences of facts and weave them into an explanation. Explanations bind these facts together. Making them easy to remember. They help us make more sense of the facts. Because our brains can&amp;#39;t store all that information. Stories stick, statistics don&amp;#39;t
    - The more you summarize, the more order you put in, the less randomness. The same condition that makes us simplify pushes us to think that the world is less random that it actually is.
-	In some strategies, you gamble dollars to win a succession of pennies while appearing to be winning all the time. In other strategies, you risk a succession of pennies to win dollars. In other words, you bet either that the black swan will or won&amp;#39;t happen. These require completely different mind sets.
  - Most people have a preference for number 1
  - Some bets in which one wins big but infrequently, yet loses small but frequently, are worth making if others are suckers for them and if you have the personal and intellectual stamina
-	We favor the narrated. We are not manufactured to understand abstract matters, we need context. Randomness and uncertainty are abstractions. We respect what has happened, ignoring what could have happened.
-	Our ideas are sticky: once we produce a theory, we are not likely to change our minds. When you develop your opinions on the basis of weak evidence, you will have difficulty interpreting subsequent information that contradicts these opinions. So those who delay developing their theories are better off
-	We humans are the victims of an asymmetry in the perception of random events. We attribute our success to our skills, and our failures to external events outside our control, namely to randomness. We feel responsible for the good, but not for the bad.
-	Taleb&amp;#39;s Perfect World – &amp;quot;Think of someone heavily introspective, tortured by the awareness of his own ignorance. He lacks the courage of the idiot, yet has the rare guts to say &amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t know.&amp;quot; He does not mind looking like a fool. He hesitates, he will not commit, and he agonizes over the consequences of being wrong. He introspects, introspects, and introspects until he reaches physical and mental exhaustion. This does not mean he lacks confidence, only that he holds his own knowledge to be suspect.
-	Louis Pasteur – &amp;quot;Luck favors the prepared&amp;quot;
-	The black swan asymmetry allows you to be confident about what is wrong, not about what you believe is right
-	So, what to do if you can&amp;#39;t predict in a world with Black Swans??
  - Avoid unnecessary dependence on large scale harmful predictions. Be fooled in small matters, not large. Example – don&amp;#39;t accept the government forecast for SS payments 50 years from now.
  - Do not listen to economic forecasters or to predictions
  - Be prepared! Be prepared for all relevant eventualities
  - People are often ashamed of losses, so they engage in strategies that produce very little volatility but contain the risk of large loss.
  - Barbell Strategy
    - Be as hyper-conservative and hyper-aggressive and you can instead of being mildly aggressive or conservative
    - Put 80-90% in extremely safe investments – (Example – T-Bills)
    - Put the other 10-20% in extremely speculative investments (Example – VC)
    - You have no risk on one side and high risk on the other, which equals out to medium risk. This minimizes your risk of negative black swans and exposures you to positive black swans
    - Put yourself in situations where favorable consequences are much larger than unfavorable ones
    - I am very aggressive when I can gain exposure to positive Black Swans and very conservative when I am under threat from a negative Black Swan",finance

# **The Dao of Capital**

-	&amp;quot;The art of economics consists in looking not merely at the immediate but at the longer effects of any act or policy.&amp;quot; Hazlet
-	&amp;quot;You have to love to lose money and hate to make money to be successful&amp;quot; Klopp
-	Far better to avoid direct, head-on competition and instead, pursue the roundabout path toward an intermediate step that leads to an eventual position of advantage
-	Natural systems – from forests to markets – continuously seek balance.
-	Austrian investing takes a roundabout path to market success by pursuing immediate loss during the investment process so you can gain more advantageously in the future.
-	If investors could use history to predict market movements, they&amp;#39;d never be surprised by them or lose huge amounts of money.
-	The market cannot be understood as predictable and law-abiding since it&amp;#39;s unpredictable and chaotic at its core.
-	The roundabout – the pain of positioning and paying now for the advantage and payoff later – only works when we remove our temporal blinders that keep us hyper focused in the moment. Then, and only then, can we pursue those proximal aims intended to give us an intermediate advantage from which the distal ends are more easily and effectively achieved. To say this is extremely challenging is an understatement.
-	To succeed with the strategy of Austrian Investing, you must be able to tolerate initial setbacks.
-	A system should naturally achieve balance through internal guidance. Attempts to intervene in the system will usually cause more problems than they solve. The Austrian School of Economics believes this about markets: government intervention doesn&amp;#39;t help balance markets, it distorts them.
-	We can only succeed with Austrian investing if we can stop focusing on the short term. This is extremely difficult, but it&amp;#39;s also critical to our success in the long run. It&amp;#39;s hard because humans are designed to prefer things that benefit them now rather than later.
  - This is part of our evolution as humans; we had to focus on immediate threats in order to survive and thrive as a species. Our culture also teaches us that the moment is all that matters—we live in an instant gratification society where people want everything right now without having to work hard for it or wait long periods of time (such as saving money).
-	Patience is the most precious treasure
  - Most people are unable to take the roundabout route because our evolution and desire for the here and now (Like the children in the marshmallow study, 1 now or 2 later). Therein lies an edge to the Austrian investor who can take the roundabout approach
  - The reason for this difficulty can be found in our wiring, those genetic tracings of our evolutionary journey rooted in survival, when overlooking immediate needs was reckless and life-threatening.
-	Without a functioning feedback loop, the system goes haywire like a faulty thermostat
-	The Federal Reserves attempts at &amp;quot;Fire Suppression&amp;quot; leads inevitably to bigger and more deadly &amp;quot;Forest Fires&amp;quot;
-	Austrians believe in the &amp;quot;boom and bust cycle&amp;quot; where artificially low interest rates foster an unsustainable boom (characterized by overleveraged borrowers investing in operating capital that will be unproductive at natural interest rates) and the inevitable bust.
-	Markets tend to experience infrequent, large moves or &amp;quot;fat tails&amp;quot;
-	Wall Street&amp;#39;s problem is one of lost opportunity; you MUST go for it now or you won&amp;#39;t have a chance tomorrow. This causes Wall Street traders to focus on the now

-	You can&amp;#39;t time the market. IE – Pick tops and bottoms.
-	Short term doesn&amp;#39;t matter
-	When interest rates are low, bonds are not as negative correlated as you would like with equities and not as much of a safe haven. Do not chase yields
-	The federal reserve will have difficulty &amp;quot;normalizing rates&amp;quot;
-	Alpha (inefficiencies) is difficult to capture for investors
  - The question you have to ask yourself is &amp;quot;Can you be more efficient than the market?&amp;quot; NO
-	We don&amp;#39;t know how the next recession will play out ahead of time. Cover your contingencies. Don&amp;#39;t just plan for one.
-	Don&amp;#39;t fight the fed. IE – Shorting risk assets
-	In a crash, almost all asset correlation goes to 1
  - Diversification in that scenario won&amp;#39;t protect your portfolio
-	If you are in the derivatives market (IE – ETNs), you are taking credit risk from the issuer
-	2 types of safe havens. Nothing else is a safe haven.
  - Insurance (Left tail way OTM 30% puts)
    - Does very well in a crash
    - small loss during up market
    - has a high degree of confidence (not a lot of &amp;quot;noise&amp;quot;)
  - Store of Value (Gold)
    - does ok in a crash
    - up/down during an up market
    - has a high degree of confidence
    - No counter party risk
-	Safe Haven imposters - vulnerable in a crash, needs a lot of luck for that safe haven to pay off in a crash. Have a low degree of confidence it will pay off during a crash
  - Unsafe Haven
    - Hedge funds
    - long/short equity fund (can&amp;#39;t time correctly)
    - High dividend stocks
    - REITs
    - Commodity index
  - Hopeful Haven
    - Value stocks
    - 10 - year bonds
    - VIX (difficult to time and it will punish you severely during a up market)

-	The federal reserve low interest rates are causing investors to chase yield and creating distortions in the market
-	You want to have money for when the liquidation of this malinvestment occurs so you can buy cheap equities
-	Precious Metals/Gold are a great store of value
-	Focus on your &amp;quot;dry powder&amp;quot;

-	Investing in the stock market is a good idea, but you have to be careful. When interest rates are too low and there&amp;#39;s too much money being printed by central banks, it can lead to malinvestment. Malinvestment is when people invest in things that aren&amp;#39;t useful or valuable for society. That leads to crashes in the market.
  - Distorted markets are prone to crashes
  - So, stay out of them and wait for the distortions to pass before investing again.
-	Tobin&amp;#39;s Q (Misesian Stationary index) is a good measure of stock valuations. Market is fair valued at 1
  - It is the ratio of the market value of the companies/replacement cost of those business or total US corporate equity/total US corporate net worth. Lower number is better. High was 2.15 in 2000. 2021 is 2.75
-	Tobin&amp;#39;s Q has a direct inverse correlation with future stock returns. Higher number = lower returns. When financial markets are distorted, they carry the seeds of their own destruction. The inevitable bust that follows the boom is not an unexpected event.
-	Basic premise is to stay out of the market for long periods of time when distortions are running high and wait for the inevitable collapse to purchase cheap equities. The objective of roundabout investing is not to make money now, but to position ourselves for better investment opportunities later
-	The challenge to the Misesian strategy is that it requires contrarian thinking, to &amp;quot;zig&amp;quot; when the rest of the world is &amp;quot;zagging&amp;quot;. You have to step back when the MS Index is high so you can act like a corporate raider when it is low
-	Explosive Left Tail risk hedging (what Mark does) is very difficult for the average investor or even professional. Don&amp;#39;t try it
-	For the average retail investor, Cash is good when Tobins Q is high so you have &amp;quot;dry powder&amp;quot; for the inevitable collapse. You don&amp;#39;t want to be shorting the market or in risk assets. This is difficult because you will watch the market go up while you are setting on the sidelines

CryptoCurrency,"History of the US dollar, and why despite not being backed by gold, it will not disappear anytime soon (Part 1)","Alright listen up brothers and sisters. In this thread I’d like to drop some educational content that is related to crypto/ inspired by the recent stable coins debate, and the many claims I’ve seen of people regarding the US dollar, it’s actual value, what it is or isn’t backed by, and how the future of the global financial system will change once FIAT money is obsolete. I’d like to take some time to go over the history of the US dollar, the Federal Reserve (since it plays a major role in the success), and overall American dominance. This will hopefully make you understand a little bit more of the political side of the US dollar, and what it will take to actually install a decentralized global financial system. 

**This will be divided in multiple parts because it’s so much to cover**

Quickly, the invention of money was essentially a purpose to trade goods. While there were many forms of money, I’ll jump to the time we started using precious metals as currency. There, we would use anything from gold, to silver, to nickel, until we eventually decided to accept printed paper as a representation of “money”, however that paper was always backed by a certain amount of those precious metals - SPOILER ALERT, it’s not anymore.

**The Federal Reserve:**

Let’s start with the creation of the Federal Reserve. Founded in 1913, on December 23rd (yes, there’s a reason for that too), the founding members of the FED already had one failed attempt to create the it (rejected by the US Congress on their first try). The founding members, which were 6 rich bankers that at this point in time represented roughly 25% of the global wealth, met with a few republican politicians on Jekyll island (in a clubhouse that was owned by JP Morgan, richest man alive at that time) to discuss the creation of a US central bank. For one week they worked on that plan and eventually proposed it to Congress (by Nelson Aldrich - who happened to be the son in law of the Rockefeller family) however it was shut down immediately as it was pretty obvious what they were trying to do. 

Smart as they were however, they decided to meet again and change up the plan a little bit. In Short, they added some academic lingo, added a few economics professors in order to reword the whole thing in a more scientific way, and then most importantly started a campaign AGAINST their own plan. Nelson Aldrich came out and said that this new plan of a Federal Reserve would severely limit the banks abilities to do business. This actually worked and the people believed that this new FED would actually be there to CONTROL the banks (aka if a banker is against this, it must be a good thing). 

As mentioned before, this was then up for voting on December 23rd, when most politicians were already on vacation, and then signed by the president on December 24th, aka nobody even took notice of it. 

The implications as we know were immense. The FED became the most powerful bank of all time, and most importantly the transition from a regular “democracy” to a financial democracy in the United States had concluded.

**World War I:**

Freshly created, the FED got super lucky with the First World War breaking out in Europe almost immediately. Obviously, this presented an incredible business opportunity for the American bank elite, handing out loan after loan to the countries at war (UK, Germany, Italy, but also to Russia for example). Btw, Woodrow Wilson campaigned as the anti-war president, yet led America straight into it in 1917 (just in case you hadn’t lost all faith in American presidents yet) - reason for that is because the FED had given so many loans to the UK and it’s allies, way more than they had given to Germany, yet Germany was about to win this war (they were rightfully scared that none of them would be able to pay back anymore).

personalfinance,"Hey, quick question. What kind of trouble could I get in by not having my taxes filed by today's date? [Michigan]","I'm reading online and it looks like I'm probably okay.

I just never got around to H&amp;R block this year to do my taxes. I had several appointments and I ended up having to cancel all of them, and I've basically been in a coma for a month since my dog died.

Now I'm out of my depression induced coma and I've realized i need to do my taxes. 

I've never done them this late before.

So, I'm reading online and it says if I don't owe any money to uncle Sam, I probably won't have any issues because there's no debt for them to charge interest on. It's highly unlikely that I owe tax money. I'm probably owed a return. My employer takes my taxes out of my paychecks and I claim 1 dependent only (myself). I've never been in a situation where I owed federal taxes. I don't see why this time would be any different. I have however owed a small sum to the state of Michigan because my employer is in Indiana and I live in Michigan. So I have to pay state taxes for both. That year my employer wasn't taking enough out of my checks for my Michigan taxes so I owed like 100$ which is no big deal. That could potentially happen again this year but I don't know if it relates to federal government interest on owed taxes.

So I probably don't owe anything. I work for a company just like I always have. Never owed federal before.

But online it says I can still get late filing or failure to file charges on my taxes. I haven't ever heard of this and I've done my taxes slightly past the deadline before. I don't know what those charges entail or how I acquire them.

If I was to file my taxes next week, what kind of risk am I at? Next week is the plan for filing my taxes.

Should I even be worried at all?",finance
personalfinance,Can the recent spikes in monthly US inflation rates be a reason for concern?,"I have a basic understanding of the financial market, but I am definitely no expert. So, this is really meant as a question and not a provocative statement.  

From my understanding, the US inflation rate in the past few months rose way above the targeted 2%:
- 4,2% in April
- 5,0% in May
- 5,4% in June

When looking at the historical data, you can see that the months prior to the economical crash in 2008, the monthly inflation rate rose above 5,0% as well. 

At the same time the FED is continuing its asset purchases, arguing that we are still in need of further progress. From todays press conference of the FED CNBC states “The central bank decided not to raise interest rates from near zero nor adjust the pace at which it buys government bonds each month.“

I am aware that the economical situation today is different than it was in the past and that the rise in inflation might only be temporary. But still, I am wondering if there is reason for concern based on these numbers? And if yes, what are possible implications for your savings/investment behavior?

CryptoCurrency,"There are over 3 million of us in this sub alone. If we want cryptocurrency and the technology behind it to be successful, we need to lead the way.","#WHO?

##You. Yes, you, me, and everyone else that knows there needs to be change.  

The people that lost everything in 2008, the people that work their asses off but get pay raises lower than the inflation rate, the people that have to pay fees when their savings account doesn’t have a balance that suits their bank, the people that earn 0.05% interest at a bank that loans out 10 times more money that’s kept in its reserves and charges interest on all of it. There’s a better way but they’re not going to cut themselves out. 

#HOW?

##By doing whatever you can alongside investing. 

Ask stores and businesses if they accept crypto.  Do you own a business? Explore how you could accept crypto as a form of payment. Are you a marketer? Reach out to existing projects, they may need your help. Are you a game developer or would you like to be? Think about how blockchain technology could improve in game currency, micro transactions, even statistics.  

Think about ways that you can take part in the adoption of not just decentralized, secure money and banking, but of the underlying technology. Whether it’s implementation, creation, education or simply taking part in awareness, we can all do a part. 


###We can’t just wait and hope for adoption and hope it’s what we want it to be. 


#WHY

##The original idea had us in mind, not the people and institutions that already control the monetary system, banking, and all our forms of transactions and record keeping. We stand the to gain the most. 

This is not a crazy, tin foil hat idea. This is not an illogical or unachievable goal.  While we’re buying, selling, HODLing and shit posting they are creating CBDCs and large tech and retail companies, the largest companies on the planet that effectively control our economy, are having to calm us down about rumors of their entry in cryptocurrency. Who should lead the way on this? Banks and billionaires? The people that *already* control our money? 

###The groundwork has been laid. There’s a chance that we can control our own money. There’s a chance that we can govern how our monetary system works, that we can lend securely to each other without unjustified bias. We deserve fair rates and no middle man making billions in fees, while paying us a joke of an interest rate, while charging 18% for credit and creating money out of thin air for those sweet, sweet 30 year American dream mortgages.

Should we be ok with banks and government(they’re almost as one at this point) leading the way? Or should we lead the way? The small business owners, the laborers, the regular people that get shat on, the banked and unbanked unlike. The people that Satoshi had in mind when he envisioned and executed a code that paved the way for decentralized, trustless, immutable transactions and tracking of all types. 

I believe we have more power than we realize. I believe those that stand to lose do realize it though. It’s our money, goods and services after all. 

Industry has formed around making money off of other people’s money and modesty, ethics, and fairness don’t profit quite enough. I’m tired of having to trust someone else for everything. Think of how much trust you have to put in people, institutions and businesses on a daily basis. Money, food, medicine, ownership, the list is long. 

###They need us to need them, they want money, monetary policy, and banking to be complicated and they need us to leave transactions, tracking, and record keeping left to the professionals. I don’t blame them, you get accustomed to a certain way of life and you fear change but change is constant and it’s time for some things in our society to change.

investing,Bear Theory on AMD valuation,"EDIT - added more sources

Here's my bear theory on AMD:

AMD doesn't have a transistor advantage.

Foundries have different specifications for how their chip geometry is measured. Ultimately performance benchmarks are all that matters.

AMD may be able to translate hype into sales, but that's all it is. Intel is still a superior chip because their internal geometry is impeccable, and it is seen in their performance versus AMD chips.

[https://www.pcgamer.com/chipmaking-process-node-naming-lmc-paper/](https://www.pcgamer.com/chipmaking-process-node-naming-lmc-paper/)

I also can't emphasize enough that the Federal Government will probably terminate its use of anything built by TSMC which is AMD's primary supply.

Therefore AMD is at **SIGNIFICANT RISK** to geopolitics.

They look good now but those sales could be demolished in a few months.

Here is a more technical paper on transistor gate lengths being the wrong measurement.[https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9063714](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9063714)

stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Wednesday, July 28, 2021","**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, July 28, 2021**

The market staged another remarkable reversal today, with many names that were hit yesterday clawing back their losses. The three major indexes were mixed, with Nasdaq (QQQ) climbing 0.35%. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) dipped towards the end of the session to close 0.6%  down. The Dow Jones (DIA), which tracks industrial and financial stocks, fell 0.37%. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, outperformed, rising 1.53% at the time of writing. Just like last Monday, today demonstrates that, while there are risks present in the market, investors and traders remain eager to buy up every dip.

Today, market participants continue to digest a slew of earnings reports, with three of the largest companies in the market, Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG) reporting yesterday. Today, after-hours, Facebook (FB) and PayPal (PYPL) are reporting, among many others. 

Moreover, market participants also eyed the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) July Monetary Policy Report, which largely reiterated what members of the Fed have been saying for months, but did include some new language hinting that the economic recovery is getting closer to the Fed’s stated goals. The statement read, “Last December, the Committee indicated that it would continue to increase its holdings of Treasury securities by at least $80 billion per month and of agency mortgage‑backed securities by at least $40 billion per month until substantial further progress has been made toward its maximum employment and price stability goals. Since then, the economy has made progress toward these goals, and the Committee will continue to assess progress in coming meetings.” In other words, the Fed says substantial progress has been made and that in the coming months, we will increasingly begin to hear more about a timeline to taper quantitative easing. 

On inflation, the statement largely reiterated what it has in months past. The statement read, “Inflation has risen, largely reflecting transitory factors. Overall financial conditions remain accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses” and “The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. With inflation having run persistently below this longer-run goal, the Committee will aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and longer‑term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent. The Committee expects to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these outcomes are achieved.”

However, the report did acknowledge potential risks and stated the Fed was ready to act if “appropriate risks arise”. The statement read, “In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals. The Committee's assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on public health, labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.”

Shares of Facebook (FB) fell 5% after-hours despite largely beating analyst after the company warned of a significant slowdown moving forward. Here are the numbers.

* **Earnings:** $3.61 per share, adjusted, vs. $3.03 per share as expected by analysts, according to Refinitiv.
* **Revenue:** $29.08 billion, vs. $27.89 billion as expected by analysts, according to Refinitiv.
* **Daily active users (DAUs):** 1.91 billion, vs. 1.91 billion as expected by analysts, according to StreetAccount.
* **Monthly active users (MAUs):** 2.90 billion, vs. 2.91 billion as expected by analysts, according to StreetAccount.
* **Average revenue per user (ARPU):** $10.12, vs. $9.66 as expected by analysts, according to StreetAccount.

Importantly, however, with respect to guidance, Facebook warned of a significant deceleration in growth moving forward. The company said it expects “year-over-year total revenue growth rates to decelerate significantly on a sequential basis as we lap periods of increasingly strong growth.”

**Highlights**

* Twitter (TWTR) stock surged roughly 5% before moderating after the company announced it was testing a new feature called the “Shop Module” that would enable businesses to sell their products directly through the Twitter platform. 
* Quarterly revenue for LinkedIn, the professional social network owned by tech giant Microsoft, surpassed $1 billion in the quarter for the first time.
* Youtube, which is owned by Alphabet, reported revenues of $7 billion for the quarter. To put into context how massive YouTube really is, Netflix (NFLX) had $7.3 billion in revenue this quarter, which has a $230 billion market-cap. It’s funny, in a world where the competition between streaming services for professional content is becoming increasingly more saturated, YouTube is poised to become and doesn’t spend billions to produce and acquire content. 
* Shares of chip-maker AMD gapped up today after the company beat earnings estimates and raised guidance moving forward that suggests the company will continue to take market share away from Intel. As I’ve said before, I think AMD and NVDA are the kings of this space.
* Chinese stocks gapped up today after a massive, across the board sell-off.

personalfinance,Debt consolidation loan to eliminate 27% APR credit card. Am I missing something?,"I have a credit card with an abysmal 27% interest rate (I was young and naïve). I have about $2500 of debt there and another $1750 on another credit card with a reasonable 9% interest rate.

I've already started an application with Marcus Goldman Sachs for a $5000 loan with an interest rate of 9%. Obviously that APR is not guaranteed, but it should still be well below 27%. My credit score is 711. It's a 36 mo loan, but from what I can tell there are no penalties for repaying early so the plan would be to cover the high APR card and pay off the loan well before the 36 mo is up.

It seems like a good plan to me, but I could be missing something.

Edit: The plan would be to close the high interest rate account as soon as it's paid off.",finance
personalfinance,Help! Advice switching from Wells Fargo to Alliant/Schwab/Capital One,"Hi, I just read a lot about the scandals that Wells Fargo have committed and I kinda want to get my money out of there. I recently invested the majority of my money with Vanguard and figured I might as well fix up my bank situation as well.

The primary things I'm looking for is good customer service since online banks have no physical locations to visit, a good web interface that doesn't randomly go down, and ideally no fees. I don't really think that having super high yield interest matters all that much as I plan on investing the majority of my savings. I mean having a high interest rate is still pretty nice but the bank account is primarily for rent/living expenses and an emergency fund.

My mother has been telling me to stick to brick and mortar banks, which definitely has merit. Chase and Bank of America seem to be the best options. I have just been seeing a lot of people saying that online banks are generally better in terms of having no fees and better rates.

&amp;#x200B;

Alliant Pros

Highest Interest Rate (.55%)

Credit Union, I like the idea of it but I don't think it matters all that much

Able to deposit cash at some ATMs, but there are no nearby locations in my hometown and college town

Cons

Long wait time for customer service, my 1 call to them was pretty helpful though

Bad web interface?

&amp;#x200B;

Schwab Pros

Free atm access anywhere in US and worldwide

Free investment account, I intend on sticking with vanguard so not really that important

Excellent customer service, from what I have heard

Cons

Low Rates (.05%)

&amp;#x200B;

Capital One

Has some physical locations, none near my hometown and college town

Able to deposit cash at some ATMs, but there are no nearby locations in my hometown and college town

High interest rate (.40%)

Cons

None I could easily find

&amp;#x200B;

I would appreciate if you could share personal experiences using these different banks and recommendations as to which one I should switch to. Currently, I am leaning towards Alliant. My current plan is to consolidate my banking to one new bank. I was thinking of maybe using the Schwab checking account since it seems to have the best perks, but I think it would be a hassle to transfer money between different banks.

&amp;#x200B;

I also really like the look of Alliant's Credit Card, 2.5% on first 10k monthly is the best I can find. I do have another question though regarding reporting income. 

I am a student and my parents pay for my rent and living expenses, am I able to include that in the income section of the application? So far, I've been listing $0 income and I get rejected for every new card application. I'm still using my first cc from discover and its only giving me 1% cash back and I'm looking for more.

Any input would be greatly appreciated!",finance

personalfinance,Worth refinancing if you are already on-track to pay off your loan early?,"Like many here, our mortgage lender contacted us about refinancing. We'd be doing it primarily to save on interest. However, aside from the normal considerations, a factor for us is that we have been regularly paying extra against our principal and are on track to pay off our current loan before its end date (thus saving us interest already). We have a 30 year mortgage but believe we'll pay it off in the 16-18 year time frame.

* Loan origination amount: $127,000
* Current amount we owe: $96,400
* Current interest rate: 3.875%
* Loan origination: 2015

&amp;#x200B;

* Refinance offer: 20 year mortgage at 2.75%
* Closing costs: $3700

With being already 7 years into our mortgage and expecting to pay it off in 10-12 years, taking out a new 20 year mortgage and paying on that new payment schedule doesn't seem to make sense. We don't think we'll stay in our house until it's paid off. We may stay past the break-even point for the refinance, but that's close to the timeline that we'd likely be re-evaluating our housing situation.

Any thoughts on if a refinance could save us more than our strategy of paying off our current loan early?",finance

personalfinance,Mortgage Lender Changing Terms Shortly Before Closing,"I went under contract in mid June for a place. Had two lenders that had the best deals and price matched each other against each other. Bank T offered 3% with .125 points. Bank F offered 3%, no points, they cover origination fee, and an additional 2600 in lender credits to cover appraisals with a little extra left over. I sent this and clearly stated these terms to Bank T, after a few days they said they'd match it. I asked for an updated loan estimate to make sure we're all on the same page but all I got was a ""this email is confirmation."" This was all in mid to late June.

I decided on Bank T because I had been working with them longer. Last week because of the dropping interest rates, I floated down to 2.75. Then on Friday July 23, I receive my first closing disclosure in over a month, and the origination fee and appraisal are included in closing costs. I email immediately saying this isn't what we agreed to; I receive a reply saying that because I floated down I lost the rest of the agreement. I stated I understand losing the credit for points, but I'm still expecting my underwriting and appraisals to be covered with lender credits...why would I choose an offer that costs more than a competing one? I sent all the emails verifying that I was clear on what Bank F offered, including resending what Bank F had offered, and was told they would not do that. 

Am I wrong for thinking I should still be entitled to the lender credits for origination/appraisal? If I am not wrong, what additional recourse do I have? It's only 1600$ but to me it's really shady bait and switch to do something like this.",finance
CryptoCurrency,"[Futures, shorts, leverage &amp; liquidations] Everything you need to know and why to avoid them","I will try to do a brief but relatively in depth analysis of all this terms, how they work, my experience and why they are dangerous.

First of all let's define futures: they are ""contracts for assets (especially commodities or shares) bought at agreed prices but delivered and paid for later"", in this case, crypto. Basically when doing a LONG you are ""betting"" the price will go up on a certain coin, when going on SHORT you are ""betting"" the price will go down.

So, as I just mentioned, shorting means you believe the price of an asset will fall. Say somebody for example shorted BTC at 64k at the peak of the bull run with 1000 dollars and cancelled his contract at 32k, this means that he has a gain of ~50% which means he would be left with ~1490 dollars after fees. Short positions are really dangerous because there is no limit to how high a coin might go, so for example is a coin 3x, this means that the shorter must pay 2 times the amount he invested originally (for example the other guy would need to pay 2000 dollars). This is because for a 3x to happen the price rose 200%.

And this is when liquidations come into play. If the guy opened a short position at a coin price of 1 with 1000 dollars, then the price of the coin went to 2.1 this means that his debt should have been 1100 dollars, but most exchanges won't allow this and liquidate your position without consent, this is to avoid the user getting in debt. Liquidation is ""to settle (a debt) by payment or other settlement"" so basically they are selling your position so that you don't have a debt which you could default and pass to them. This is really dangerous because unlike buying coins in which you have an underlying asset that you will always have if you buy a future you might get liquidated and lose everything, because they are not an asset but rather a betting on an asset's price movement.

Regarding leverage it's like using more money that you actually to open a the contracts. For instance. You have a 10 dollar wallet and want to long 100 futures of a coin worth 1 dollar. Normally you would need 100 dollars, but if you open a leveraged future position with 10x this means that your 10 dollars are now able to open a position 10 times their value, this means you can long the 100 contracts. ROA is the return of the contract without leverage, for example you long a coin at 1x, the coin loses 10% of it's value and you lose 10% of your assets. With leverage you use ROE, which is ROA x LEVERAGE. This means that the 10% loss times 10 would be a 100% loss, so your position would be liquidated. All percentual gains would also be 10 times bigger, but loses are also huge too, and you only need to lose the 100% of your wallet one time to lose everything, remember that. 

To show the risks: using 100% leverage you get liquidated of the coins price moves around 0.90%, and we have seen this movements thousands of times in less than a minute. So avoid by all means leveraged positions. I personally never use more than 3x and I have a relatively large experience.

There are two types of futures, perpetual which don't have a pay date, but have interest rates that must be paid between shorters and sellers so that the price is relatively similar between the asset and the future contract value and there is also futures that expire on an certain date, this means that you are betting the price will be lower/higher at the opening of that day.

Moreover the contracts may be isolated positions or cross positions. ALWAYS use isolated ones. Cross positions mean that if your position is about to get liquidated the exchange will borrow more money from other of other wallets/coins to keep the position open. This can lead to TOTAL LOSS OF ALL YOUR SAVINGS. So NEVER use cross positions. I literally lost my entire first wallet overnight due to a leveraged wallet on cross position. It's a kick in the nuts. In isolated positions, the worst that can happen is that you lose all the money that you used to open that specific position.

If you have any questions please hit me up. I must add I just see futures as a financial instrument, I don't encourage their use, specially if you are new, and NEVER use more than 3x leverage, crypto has enough volatility for traders, no need for extra risks. 

My advice would be the usual DCA and don't fear the power of the hodl. Thanks for reading until here.

Hope you enjoyed the post! Have a great night!",cryptocurrency

stocks,Devil Take the Hindmost A History of Financial Speculation Book Summary Part 1,"# **Edward Chancellor Devil Take the Hindmost A History of Financial Speculation**

-	After fiat money was introduced in Rome during the 3rd century A.D, currency crises became common
-	Journalist Mike Royko described the market as manic-depressive. All you have to do is listen to the daily broadcasts and you think you are hearing the latest medical report on someone who ought to be in therapy or tied to a bed.
-	Bull phase – market is frenetic and expectations become unrealistic
-	Bear phase – market is depressed, activity is slow and universal pessimism replaces universal optimism
-	Ben Graham – In the short term, the market is a voting machine, in the long term, a weighing machine
  - **Dutch Tulip Crisis**
-	During Tulipomania there was little attempt to justify the prices paid for tulips, most speculators entered into contracts with the intention of quickly selling at a higher price
-	The Tulip market crashed on February 3, 1637. There was no clear reason for the panic
-	In the aftermath of the tulip crisis, tulipomania gave way to tulip phobia – a revulsion analogous to the public distaste for common stocks after the crash of 1929 and Japan after 1989
-	The course of the tulip mania was similar to many later crashes. Initially started with a rise in prices for the precious Semper Augustus bulbs which attracted new entrants into the market, so stock market booms are commonly triggered by a sharp climb in the share prices of a particular sector.
-	As a bull market mania progresses, the quality of the stocks (or tulips) that attract speculation declines – a rising tide floats all ships, even those unseaworthy. Rumors fuel the boom, rapid growth of leverage through the use of futures and credit, sharply rising prices followed by sudden panic without cause and initial government passivity followed by intervention
-	Austrian economist J.A Schumpeter observed that speculative manias commonly occur at the inception of a new industry or technology when people overestimate the potential gains and too much capital is attracted to new ventures
-	John Stewart Mill said the seeds of each boom are sown during the preceding crisis, when the liquidation of credit causes asset prices to decline so severely that they become genuine bargains. Their subsequent sharp rise from a low-level lead to a revival of speculation. Unable to remember the past, investors are doomed to repeat it
  - **Stockjobbing in Change Alley London**
-	Charles Kindleberger suggests that speculative manias typically commence with a displacement which excites speculative interest. The displacement may come either from an entirely new object of investment or from the increased profitability of established investments. It is followed by a positive feedback loop as rising share prices induce inexperienced investors to enter the market, and results in euphoria. Speculation becomes more diffuse and spreads to different classes of assets. New companies are floated, investors leverage their gains, credit becomes overextended, swindling and fraud are common, then the economy enters a period of financial distress which is the prelude to the onset of a crisis
-	The success of legitimate Captain Philips diving expedition and the East India Company caused promotors to cash in on investor euphoria to float new ventures which were fraudulent
-	The mania played out as a series of mini-bubbles. Shares were driven above their intrinsic values by speculators using financial derivatives (futures, options, credit). The boom lost momentum after expectations were disappointing and business failed.
-	An impatience to be rich, a contempt for those slow but sure gains which are proper reward of industry, patience and thrift, spread though society
  - **South Sea Scheme**
-	Sir Isaac Newton – &amp;quot;I can calculate the motions of the heavenly bodies, but not the madness of men.&amp;quot;
-	There was a company stock floated (IPO) during the bubble which said &amp;quot;For carrying on an undertaking of great advantage but no one to know what it is.&amp;quot;
-	Only 4 of 190 bubble companies founded in 1720 survived
-	Speculators did not buy bubble companies shares as long-term investments, they bought them with the intention of selling them on to greater fools
-	Many buyers of the stock knew they were purchasing at absurd prices and that the long-term prospects of the company were hopeless; however, they all believed or hoped that they would be able to sell before the price plummeted
-	Joseph Schumpeter – &amp;quot;The mania of 1720 was exactly as were later manias of this kind, induced by a preceding period of innovation which transformed the economic structure and upset the preexisting state of things.&amp;quot;
-	The South Sea Company bribed both the Court and Parliament.
  - **Fool&amp;#39;s Gold**
-	The most common practice of projectors seeking to promote their companies was to employ members of Parliament and their peers as directors
-	Emerging market speculation tends to appear at a juncture in the economic cycle when declining yields on domestic bonds combine with an excess of capital to make foreign investments particularly attractive.
-	The boom of 1822-1825 can be understood as the product of easy credit conditions
-	During the boom, the unrestricted growth of credit caused asset prices to rise, stimulating further credit creation. The situation reached a turning point in the spring of 1825, after which declining asset prices undermined confidence, caused a contraction of credit, and eventually brought on a crisis.
-	When owners of savings are not finding their usual kind of investments, they rush into anything that promises speciously, and when they find that these specious investments can be disposed of at a high profit, the rush into them more and more.
-	During the upturn in the cycle, people become convinced the prosperity will last forever.
-	After 1825, there was a succession of booms and crises at roughly 10-year intervals
  - **England Railway Mania**
-	Joseph Schumpeter, Speculators are in the vanguard of capitalist process. Once an innovation has been established and produces steady returns, speculation gives way to investment, which is more concerned with safety of principal and regularity of income than with capital gains. &amp;quot;Unlike the speculator, the investor is primarily interested in the current state of affairs; insofar as he anticipates the future at all, he hopes that it will be a seamless continuation of the present.&amp;quot;
-	Innovations and novelties have always excited speculators.
-	The railway journals were enthusiastic and uncritical supporters of railway schemes. They &amp;quot;puffed&amp;quot; new offerings and in return got hundreds of thousands of pounds spent on weekly advertisements
-	There was an abundant of oversupply in terms of proposals for the very same rail-lines; each of these stock companies would all trade a premium even though it was known that only one of them would succeed and actually be allowed to build
-	Economist article &amp;quot;There is not a single dabbler in scrip who does not steadfastly believe-first, that a crash sooner or later, in inevitable; and, secondly, that he himself will escape it. When the luck turns, and the crack play devil take the hindmost, no one fancies that the last mail train from PANIC station will leave him behind. In this &amp;#39;Men deem all men mortal but themselves.&amp;#39;&amp;quot;
-	There was an &amp;quot;extraordinary diversion of capital from traditional purposes to the construction of railways.&amp;quot; It took nearly 2 years for the full impact of the reckless railway speculation to be felt in the economy at large.
  - **The Gilded Age**
-	The aim of the corner was to acquire a sufficient number of shares to force up the price and catch out the bears who had sold short
  - He who sells what isn&amp;#39;t his&amp;#39;n, must buy it back or go to pris&amp;#39;n
-	Corners were normally undertaken by informal speculative partnerships and accompanied by market manipulation. It is a tense game that often fails.
-	&amp;quot;Call&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Margin&amp;quot; loans became common and increased volatility in the market
-	During a market crisis, call rates rose sharply and loans were withdrawn, but because liquidity in the stock market dried up and borrowers were unable to sell securities, banks often experienced difficulty in retrieving their loans. This makes banks vulnerable to panics
-	Congress passed a law outlawing trading in gold futures, but this only caused panic and gold shot up by 33%
-	Some speculators, known as &amp;quot;panic birds&amp;quot; came to the market only once prices had crashed and money was scarce; the bought carefully, locked up their investments, and kept away from Wall Street until the next calamity stuck.
-	But most speculators got caught up in the carnival atmosphere and remained until they lost everything
-	Although the market is better regulated today, the speculators propensity for manipulation has not diminished with time
  - **The Crash of 1929**
-	&amp;quot;Stock prices have reached what looks like a permanently high plateau.&amp;quot; Yale economist Irving Fisher a few weeks before the crash
  - He believed that America had entered a &amp;quot;new era&amp;quot; of limitless prosperity
-	People tend to &amp;quot;fancy the prosperity they see will always last, that it is only the beginning of a greater prosperity.&amp;quot;
-	People believe we are living in a &amp;quot;new era&amp;quot; and that old rules and principles and precedents of finance were obsolete. That things could safely be done today which had been dangerous and impossible in the past
-	Some time passes and people forget the past lessons and the same arguments come back and the same lessons must be relearned
-	The rich became richer during the 1920&amp;#39;s, but the workers were unable to enjoy the benefits of their improved productivity.
  - Unable to maintain their share of the economic surplus, workers experienced a decline in real wages during the decade as corporate profits rose
  - Capitalism, however, requires consumers as much as savers. But the demand was maintained by a massive expansion of consumer credit
  - Consumers, in their appetite for immediate gratification, were devouring their future. And when that future finally arrived, the cupboard was bare.
-	Margin loans were being used to invest in the stock market, further pushing up asset prices. This created a vicious circle
-	The federal reserve ignited a bubble by lowering interest rates to help the bank of England stop the flow of Gold
  - Once the fed realized they created a bubble, they increased rates from an all-time low of 3.5% back to 6%. But this interest was too low to reduce speculation while also being too high for the economy as a whole
-	Lots of new brokerage houses opened at the peak. Usually, to sell to retail investors who were not as financially literate
-	Charles Mitchell became the most prominent cheerleader of the bull market and &amp;quot;new era&amp;quot; investing. He stated stocks were as safe as bonds. He went bankrupt after the crash
-	The most striking thing about the stock market boom of the 1920&amp;#39;s was how speculation became central to the culture
-	A dominate feature of the 1920&amp;#39;s stock market was the use of debt to pyramid investments and enhance gains.
-	Groucho Marx &amp;quot;No need to employ a financial advisor to select your stocks. You can close your eyes, stick your finger any place on the big board and the stock you bought would start rising.&amp;quot;
-	Leverage was not confined to individuals&amp;#39; speculators margin holdings; it became built into the financial structure of corporate America
-	History, which has a painful way of repeating itself, has taught mankind that speculative overexpansion invariably ends in over contraction and distress…. If orgies of speculation are permitted to spread too far, however, the ultimate collapse is certain not only to affect the speculators themselves, but also to bring about a general depression involving the entire country.
-	Shares were trading at 30 P/E&amp;#39;s
-	Crowds and bull markets are inherently unstable; it has no stasis, no point of equilibrium, and is driven by the dynamic either to grow or shrink. At the moment of its dispersal, a crowd frequently succumbs to panic, often at the most minor things.
-	The intellectual inferiority of the crowd is a sign that people are filtering and manipulating information to make it agree with their existing beliefs. This is known as &amp;quot;Cognitive Dissonance&amp;quot; and dissonant information, which contradicts the collective fantasy, is uncomfortable and people seek to avoid it.
  - A group will maintain a state of cognitive dissonance until the pain exceeds the rewards. Or in stock market terms, the fear of loss outweighs the greed for gains
-	Roger Babson forecast an imminent stock market crash and was met with a savage response from the new era speculators
-	The panic before the 1929 stock market crash had no palpable cause. It was not proceeded by tightness in the money market. No banking brokerage, or industrial failure served to trigger
-	The glamour stocks (High P/E) of the bull market suffered the worst damage
-	1920&amp;#39;s similar to 1990&amp;#39;s
-	The rise in speculation was initially stimulated by low interest rates
-	The belief that the stock market would invariably produce the greatest returns led investors to purchase shares regardless of price even though P/E&amp;#39;s were at historic highs
-	Investors saw each market decline as an opportunity to &amp;quot;buy into the dip&amp;quot; and as a result, every downturn was quickly reversed
-	The rising stock market inflated investors expectations to irrational levels
-	In the short run, the rising stock market serves to cover up weakness in the economy. Consumers spend their stock market gains and ignore rising debts, companies issue new shares or bonds, and governments enjoy rising tax receipts",finance
stocks,4 Pillars of Investing by William Bernstein Part 1,"William Bernstein

**Four Pillars of Investing**

Math – Chapter 2

-	DR – Discount Rate – Amount we expect to get from the market. IE 8% Return
-	Two times this century, investors have demanded a 15% DR.
-	High DR = high perceived risk, high returns, depressed stock price
-	Low DR = low perceived risk, low returns, elevated stock price
-	PV – Present Value
-	DR and PV are inversely related. Higher DR = Lower PV or Lower DR = Higher PV
-	The risker the situation, the higher the DR we demand, and the less that asset is worth to us
-	Food companies DR is lower because their earnings/dividends are more stable. Compare this to the DR of an auto company who has a higher DR because their earnings are more erratic. This is why cyclical companies with erratic earnings sell cheaper than say food companies
-	It is impossible to do this with a single security. Because if the company falters, then your math will be off. But for the market as a whole. It will work because it evens out. The income stream of the market as a whole is more reliable. You can also use this formula in reverse.
  - Fisher&amp;#39;s Dividend Discount Method (DDM) - Market Value = Present Dividend / (DR - Dividend Growth Rate)
-	Historic DGR is 4.5 - 5%
-	The above equation does not predict the short-term future. You can make it say whatever you want. One book even predicted a 36,000 Dow based on this formula in 2000
-	Gordon Equation – As close to financial law as you can get. Accurate way to predict long term stock returns (20-30 Years)
  - DR (Market Return) = Dividend Yield + Earnings Growth
-	This formula has been extremely accurate. It predicted a 9% (4.5% Yield + 4.5% Growth) growth the last century and the actual growth was 9.89%.
-	If a company doesn&amp;#39;t pay dividends, their long-term return would roughly be the same as their aggregate earnings growth. IE – 10% earnings growth would get 10% return. But the long-term average corporate earnings and dividends growth is 5% and has not changed in 100 years.
-	Remember, if the average annualized earnings growth is about 5%, the annualized stock price increase must be very close to this number. Unless they are buying shares or selling shares. Then the growth rate will increase or decrease by that amount. IE – company has 5% growth and bought back 5% of outstanding shares = 10% growth. Or company has 5% growth and sells 5% of outstanding shares = 0% growth. But for the market as a whole, this evens out.
-	Gordon Equation works with bonds too. You just put the DGR at 0. Market Return = Dividend Yield
-	Over short periods (less than 20 years) changes in the dividend yield or PE multiple account for most of the stock markets return. This is the &amp;quot;speculative return&amp;quot; of the market. The short-term return of the market is purely speculative and cannot be predicted.
-	Long term increases in the stock market value is entirely the result of long term dividend growth and dividend yield calculated from the Gordon Equation or &amp;quot;fundamental return&amp;quot; of the market
-	Ralph Wanger analogy of the market = The market is a very excitable dog on a very long leash in NYC, darting randomly in every direction. The dog&amp;#39;s owner is walking from Columbus Circle, through Central Park, to the Met. At any moment, the is no predicting which way the dog will lurch. But in the long run, you know he is headed Northeast at 3 mph. The problem is that almost all of the market players have their eye on the dog and not the owner.
-	If public confidence is low, DR will rise and asset prices will fall, which will increase subsequent returns. The opposite is also true. This means the worst possible time to invest is when the skies are the clearest. The best possible time to invest is when the skies are darkest. You are going to be investing against the grain if you want good returns.
-	DR seems quite sensitive to prior stock market returns. This means a rising stock market lowers DR and perceived risks which drives up prices. Then you get the vicious cycle. The same thing happens in reverse during recessions/depressions.
-	Rule of 72 = Take the earnings rate and divide by 72 which tells you how long it takes to double your earnings. IE – 5% growth/72 = 14 years. 12% growth/72 = 6 years

Pillar 1 Theory

-	A stock purchased with the hope that its price will soon rise independent of its dividend-producing ability is a speculation, not an investment.
-	Risk and return are inextricably connected. If you desire the opportunity to achieve high returns, you have to shoulder high risk
-	Do not expect safety without correspondingly low returns
-	When political and economic outlook is the brightest, returns are the lowest. When things look the darkest that&amp;#39;s when returns are the highest
-	High returns are obtained by buying low and selling high. The opposite is true
-	The low prices that produce high future returns are NOT possible without catastrophe and risk
-	High previous returns indicate low future returns, and low past returns usually mean high future returns
-	Expect at least 1 or 2 SEVERE bear markets during your investing career
-	Annual stock returns follow a bell curve and NO ONE can predict from one year to the next what will happen
-	Professor Siegel found since 1802 that stock outperform bonds 61% of the time any given year, 80% for any 10-year period, and 99% for any 30-year period
-	Stock withstand inflation better than bonds
-	Investors are more worried about the short term, not the long term. Many investors can&amp;#39;t stomach the downturns during bear markets
-	Safe investments produce low returns
-	Small cap beats large cap over the long term but with much higher volatility. There have also been times when small lost to large for 15+ years and small went down more during bear markets. This works in both US and foreign
-	Value stocks have higher returns than growth stocks. This also works with both US and foreign
-	Higher risks mean lower prices, lower prices mean higher future returns – key point of above
-	Past superior performance has NO predictive value
-	Asset bloat – as active managed funds get larger because of outperformance; their results usually decline drastically. The best results usually come early in the fund and few actually get those returns. Most jump on at the end and lose
-	Most of the nation&amp;#39;s largest pension funds are using a passive strategy. If they can&amp;#39;t pick the best active funds with all their information, how can a small investor possibly do it?
-	David Dreman tracked opinions of expert market strategists back to 1929 and found a 75% failure rate to predict the direction of the market
-	Another study showed the same thing about market timing newsletters, they are only right about 25% of the time and those people were not consistently right year after year
-	NO ONE can correctly predict the direction of the market year after year
-	Money managers can&amp;#39;t beat the market
  - The average return of a money manager is the markets return minus expenses because they are the market
  - Most money managers charge 1-2% to manage assets. So, the average return to the investor is the markets return minus 1-2%
-	Index funds are great in a taxable account. There is min turnover so they don&amp;#39;t incur capital gains taxes which can drive the active managed funds performance down 1-4%
-	Portfolio diversification through holding many different stocks is important. A concentrated portfolio maximizes your chances of a superb result but is also maximizes your chances of a poor result.
-	Owning the whole market through indexing minimizes your chances of both superb results AND poor results by guaranteeing you a market return
-	You must diversify
-	Remember that in any given year, lots of active funds will beat index funds. But that performance will not last. As the time horizon lengthens, the odds an active manager will beat the index drop considerably.
-	Clements Dictum &amp;quot;Performance comes and goes. Expenses are forever.&amp;quot;
-	Indexing works for all investing categories. Large cap, small cap, etc
-	Active managers do not do better than index in a bear market
-	There is no evidence of stock picking skill among professional money managers. From year to year, manager performance is nearly random
-	There is no evidence you can time the market. It is the duty of shareholders to periodically suffer loss
-	The most reliable way of obtaining a satisfying return is to index
-	Since you cannot successfully time the market or select individual stocks, asset allocation should be the major focus of your investment strategy, because that is all you control
-	Don&amp;#39;t design your portfolio based on what did well in the past.
-	It is not possible to predict which portfolios will perform best in the future
-	On any given year, some of your asset classes will be up and down. Do not chase results. Diversification works, even when you don&amp;#39;t want it to
-	Long term bonds are not a good investment. They are very vulnerable to interest rates, volatile and have low long-term returns. Do not buy.
-	Junk bond can make sense if the conditions are right. JTS (Junk-Treasury Spread) is above 5%. More often than not though, the JTS is low. IE – Treasury is 5% and Junk is 12% = maybe worth buying.
-	When you rebalance, you sell high and buy low
-	Foreign holdings in your portfolio should be between 15-40%. Whatever you pick, stick with it
-	You usually don&amp;#39;t want to place sector bets as you have already invested in them through your other funds. The exceptions are REIT&amp;#39;s and Precious Metals funds
-	REIT&amp;#39;s have historical returns close to the market and have a low correlation to the market.
-	REIT&amp;#39;s should have a MAX of 15% in your portfolio
-	PM funds have low expected return. But they are almost perfectly uncorrelated with the market and during global market meltdown, they are likely to do well. PM are also a hedge against inflation. But be careful with PM. Because you will be going against the market and you need to rebalance during. You will be selling when everyone on TV is saying to BUY and you will be buying when everything is good and people will tell you how dumb that is.
-	PM, REIT&amp;#39;s, Emerging Market, Small Cap International bring more to the table than the returns would suggest IF YOU REBALANCE!!!! YOU HAVE TO REBALANCE THESE FUNDS
-	Owning a small number of stocks is dangerous
-	90% of return is due to asset allocation and 10% is due to timing and stock selection
-	Ignore the year to year performance of your portfolio&amp;#39;s individual asset classes. It is the LONG-TERM behavior of your entire portfolio that matters. Do not try to move in and out of asset classes because they did bad or good any given year

Pillar 2 History

-	Investing in young tech companies yields low returns.
-	Returns on IPO&amp;#39;s are a bad deal for everyone but the underwriters
-	Necessary conditions for a bubble are
  - A major technological revolution or shift in financial practice
  - Easy credit
  - Amnesia of the last bubble. Usually takes a generation (30 years)
  - Abandonment of time-honored methods of security valuation
-	Bubbles occur whenever investors simply begin buying shares simply because they have been going up
-	The four most expensive words in the English language are &amp;quot;This time, it&amp;#39;s different.&amp;quot;
-	Severe bear markets are usually followed by powerful bull markets
-	It is human nature to be unduly influenced by the last 10-20 years. Don&amp;#39;t do this.
-	When recent returns for a given asset class have been very high or low, put your faith in the longest data series you can find, not just the most recent
-	Buying assets that everyone else has been running from take fortitude
-	Ben Graham said there were no intrinsically &amp;quot;good&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;bad&amp;quot; stocks. At a high enough price, even the best companies were highly speculative. And at a low enough price, even the worst companies were a sound investment
-	After the great depression, they were practically giving away stocks. Dividend yields were 10% and stocks were selling for less than book value
-	When the inevitable crash occurs, do not panic and sell out. Simply stand pat and stay the course with your asset allocation
-	Ideally, when prices of stocks fall dramatically, you should go even further and actually increase your percentage equity allocation. This requires nerves of steel",finance
stocks,Irrational Exuberance book summary,"# **Irrational Exuberance**

-	Irrational Exuberance has occurred throughout history many times when markets have been bid up to unusually high and unsustainable levels under the influence of market psychology
-	Irrational exuberance is the psychological basis of a speculative bubble
  - Speculative bubble is a situation in which news of price increases spurs investor enthusiasm, which spreads by psychological contagion from person to person, and, in the process, amplifies stories that might justify the price increase and brings in larger and larger class of investors, who despite doubts about the real value of the investment, are drawn to it partly through envy of others success, and party through a gambler&amp;#39;s mentality.
-	Cyclically Adjusted Price-Earnings Ratio (CAPE 10) – real (inflation adjusted) S+P Index divided by the 10-year moving average of real earnings on the index
  - As a rule, and on average, years with low CAPEs have been followed by high returns, and years with high CAPEs have been followed by low or even negative returns
-	There is a housing index from 1628-1973 of prices for homes along the Herengracht, an old canal in Amsterdam. The annual real price increase was only 0.2%. The US has averaged 0.7% since 1940. Some areas, especially glamorous cities (NYC, Paris, London), experience rare but rapid growth, but this is in brief periods. Then they return to the previous growth rate.
-	There is no argument that home prices (as a whole) can be expected to appreciate faster than consumer prices in general
-	Analyst are reluctant to make sell recommendations near the peak of a market for many reasons
  - James Grant &amp;quot;Honesty was never a profit center on Wall Street, but the brokers used to keep up appearances. Now they have stopped pretending. More than ever, securities research, as it is called, is a branch of sales. Investor, beware.&amp;quot;
-	Short term interest rates have been driven down to almost 0%. And with the fed offering &amp;quot;forward guidance&amp;quot; which has the effect to lower long-term yields too.
  - This has caused investors to be disappointed in bond yields and need to &amp;quot;reach for yield&amp;quot; for various reasons. Even though the stock market was still perceived as risky, many investors think it has real upside potential, encouraging them to purchase stocks at higher and higher multiples.
-	The inequality gap increased during the 1920&amp;#39;s during the bull market and peaked around the market high in 1929
  - The inequality gap sometimes coincides with an increase in nationalistic and xenophobic political parties
-	There is an incorrect notion in investors thinking that stocks are the &amp;quot;best investment&amp;quot; and investors cannot go wrong with them over the long run
  - You find a striking correlation between prices and &amp;quot;best investment&amp;quot;: generally, when prices are going up, the percentage who think stocks are the best investment go up too.
-	The UBS Index of Consumer Optimism reported much more optimistic average expectations among individual investors around the peak of the stock market
-	Speculative bubbles are feedback loops where price increases lead to further price increases through increased investor demand
  - Adaptive expectations – feedback takes place because past price increases generate expectations of further price increases
  - Price to GDP – as the value of the stock market or housing market increases, the resulting wealth effect and optimism encourage expenditures
  - Speculative bubbles cannot last forever and when demand stops, prices will too.
    - This bursting of the bubble doesn&amp;#39;t necessarily have to be sudden. It can take place over years as did the 1929-1932 crash.
-	Large stock market moves do not always coincide with exceptionally important news
-	The media actively shape public attention and categories of thought, and they create the environment in which the speculative market events we see are played out
  - The media can foster stronger feedback loops
-	There appears a pervasive human tendency toward overconfidence in one&amp;#39;s beliefs
  - People tend to think they know more than they do
  - People tend to make judgements in uncertain situations by looking for familiar patterns and assuming that future patterns will resemble past ones, often without sufficient consideration of the reasons for the pattern or the probability of the pattern repeating
-	Even completely rational people can participate in herb behavior when they take into account the judgments of others, even if they know that everyone else is behaving in a herd-like manner

    - The behavior, although individually rational, produces group behavior that is irrational
-	There is ample systematic evidence that firms or markets that are &amp;quot;overpriced&amp;quot; by conventional measures have indeed tended to do poorly afterword
-	Stocks tend to have a regression to the mean: what goes up a lot tends to come back down, and what goes down a lot tends to come back up
-	Findings by researchers have encouraged an approach to the market called value investing
  - Sometimes value investing strategies won&amp;#39;t work, but it does not follow that value investing will ever be out for good
-	Times of low dividend yields relative to stock prices in the stock market as a whole tend to be followed by price decreases or smaller than usual increases over long horizons.
  - When one is not getting much in dividends relative to the price one pays for stocks, it is not a good time to buy stocks historically
-	If long term interest rates are very low (as they are in 2020) then investors in bonds need to have some doubts as to their worthiness as alternatives to the stock market, even if the CAPE ratio is high.
  - Since the CAPE negatively predicts long term returns, the excess real return between stocks and bonds would be influenced negatively by both the CAPE and by the low long term interest rate.
-	The evidence that stocks will _ALWAYS_ out perform bonds over long term intervals simply does not exist.
  - The so called &amp;quot;fact&amp;quot; of superiority of stocks over bonds is not a fact at all. Stocks are residual claims on corporate cash flow, available to stockholders after everyone else has been paid. Stock are therefore, by their very definition, risky. Stocks are not guaranteed to do well
-	The pubic is said to have learned that stocks always go right back up after they go down. We have seen evidence that people do think this, but they are wrong. Stock can and do go down and stay down for long periods (Decades). They can become overpriced and underperform for long periods of time
-	The pubic is said to have leaned that stocks must always outperform other investments like bonds over the long run. This too is false.
-	The public is also said to have learned about the wisdom of investing in stocks via active mutual funds whose management teams have proven track records, and once again they are wrong.
-	After the 2001 collapse, the public is said to have learned that housing is the &amp;quot;best&amp;quot; investment. They were wrong again
  - The public must relearn all these &amp;quot;facts&amp;quot; again and again over time
-	At the time of this writing (2014) After the financial crisis, economies in many places are still weak. But these low interest rates may continue to support excessively high valuations in these markets. These problems will occur again in the future.",finance
personalfinance,Protecting a windfall from impulse control issues and .,"I come from a fairly poor family, who is quite bad with money. I have had impulse control issues in the past, but have had things under wraps for the last 5 years or so. But I am nervous that i'll screw all this up.

I'm 29 and Around $**140,000** left to pay on my apartment with a good interest rate, **$50,000** in emergency funds, roughly the same spread across stock, No Kids with no intent to have kids, no other debt. I have no desire for a larger house, and I don't drive.

I can live comfortably on about **\~$50,000** a year.

My partner earns **$70,000** as a graphic designer and I am currently taking a year to recover from burn out, working about 2-3 days a week as a software engineer for about **\~50k** a year. However I can comfortably earn $150,000+ if I decide to take that sort of work.

7 Years ago I started a company, I no longer work day to day on this company but am a major shareholder and board member, recently there has been an opportunity to sell about half of my personal private shares. Until this point, I have been considering the stock as imaginary paper money. As I didn't think there would be a liquidity event of this nature.

After tax, I look to receive **\~3.5 million AUD.**  (2.5m USD) Lawyers are currently going through the details of the sale.

I'll not be telling people apart from my partner and accountant, I have been through the windfall wiki. My intent is to treat earnings from this windfall as a salary and start new businesses without worrying about investors etc or anything else. So, I'll not be entirely dependent on the income from this money.

What steps can I take to put a barrier between myself and my money, whilst still collecting a regular income? How else can I protect this money from myself, and potentially my family?",finance
stocks,All About Asset Allocation and Protecting Your Wealth book summary by Richard Ferri,"**Richard Ferri**

**All About Asset Allocation and Protecting Your Wealth**


-	You can&amp;#39;t time the market. If Nobel winners have tried and failed (Long-Term Capital Management), what chance do I have? And during a bear market, stocks usually decline much faster than they advance during a bull market. But you don&amp;#39;t want to get out of the market then because you will miss the rally.
-	A good idea is to decide on a static percentage of stocks, bonds, alternative investments that fit your needs and then maintain that allocation for a long, long, long time. Then rebalance as needed.
-	We also have a fondness for seeing patterns where they don&amp;#39;t exist. Stocks that have done well in the past are expected to continue to do well and stocks that have done poorly are expected to continue to do poorly
-	Avoid the temptation to follow the herd and invest in the hottest sectors or stocks.
-	Don&amp;#39;t chase popular investment styles. Stick with your plan and give it time to work out
-	It is impossible to predict which type of fund will outperform any given year. Therefore, the best strategy is to hold a diversified portfolio that contains all types and stick with it
-	The more a mutual fund charges in fees, the lower the expected return
-	Take caution where you get financial advice, most of it is just salesmanship
-	Schools have spent lots of money and hours trying to figure out which active managed mutual fund managers are likely to outperform in the future. They discovered 2 facts
  - Funds with low fees tend to outperform the market
  - It is unreliable to assume that managers who have beaten the market in the past will continue to do so over the long term
-	On any given year, the index fund will be beat by many active managed funds. But in the long run, the index fund will be at the top
-	Reduce your estimated SS check at retirement by 60-70% and an increase of 5-7 years for retirement
-	Treat SS and defined pension plans as a separate account and don&amp;#39;t use it in your equity/bond calculations
-	On the short term, it is nearly impossible to predict the movement of the stock market. But over the long term, the performance of the stock market is predictable because it follows the growth of the U.S. economy
-	Earnings Growth (Corporate Earnings or GDP) +Dividend (Yield)+Speculation (P/E ratio) = market return
-	In the short run, speculation creates the volatility in stock prices, but in the long term, economic growth is the real driver of returns. You can&amp;#39;t guess what P/E ratio the market will assign in the future so don&amp;#39;t try
-	It is impossible to forecast the movement of the inflation rate, but you can limit risk by purchasing short term bonds. They don&amp;#39;t have the volatility of long-term bonds. You do get extra yield from long term bonds but it does not justify the added interest rate risk
-	Diversify your portfolio across investments in several asset classes to reduce risk and increase return
-	Make sure your investments have a low correlation with each other or you don&amp;#39;t get the benefits of diversification
-	Rebalance your portfolio at least 1 per year
-	Key points of book – All About Asset Allocation
  - Allocate our investments across multiple asset classes to reduce overall portfolio risk
  - Invest broadly within each class to eliminate the risk of owning any single security
  - Keep your costs down including taxes
  - Rebalance periodically
-	Rebalancing is the most difficult because it forces you to sell what is going up and to buy what went down
-	Try to rebalance through changes in what you buy, try not to rebalance by selling assets
-	Use a long-term strategic asset allocation or &amp;quot;buy and hold&amp;quot;. No predictions needed.
-	A successful lifelong investment experience hinges on 3 critical steps
  - Development of a prudent financial plan
  - The full implementation of that plan
  - The discipline to maintain that plan in good AND bad times
-	Investment Pyramid – 5 levels
  - Base 1 – Cash accounts for living expenses
    - Checking
    - Savings
    - Money Market
    - Emergency Fund
  - 2 - Discretionary long-term liquid investments
    - Mutual Funds
    - ETF
    - Bonds
    - CD&amp;#39;s
    - Annuities
  - 3 – Discretionary long term illiquid assets
    - Personal Home
    - Properties
    - Business
    - Collectibles
  - 4 – Nondiscretionary assets
    - Social Security
    - Pension
  - Top 5 – Discretionary Speculative
    - Commodities
    - Individual Stocks
-	6-12-month Emergency Fund recommended
-	Investing in the next hot item is very difficult to do
-	Picking a manager who can pick the next hot item is equally difficult to do
-	Do not select mutual funds on past performance. Past performance is not an indication of future results
-	Investment returns are directly related to investment risk
-	There are no risk-free investments
-	Practitioners view risk as investment volatility
-	Individuals view risk as losing money
-	There is a direct relationship between risk taken and amount of expected return
-	Investments with less risk of income disruptions have lower expected returns
-	Portfolio risk cannot be eliminated but it can be controlled with an asset allocation strategy
-	T-Bills are &amp;quot;risk free&amp;quot; but can still lose money due to taxes and inflation. If their purchasing power doesn&amp;#39;t keep up
-	High volatility means erratic returns. Low volatility means more consistent returns
-	Rebalancing is based on a theory called regression to the mean. That is, there is a natural tendency in the marketplace for all broad asset classes to return close to their history risk profiles.
-	When you rebalance, you sell some of the winners to buy some of the losers. It may feel counterintuitive at first but it follows the logic to buy low and sell high
-	Calendar based rebalancing is a good idea. Pick a date and rebalance then. You are more likely to not procrastinate
-	Rebalancing only works if the investments in the portfolio don&amp;#39;t act the same way. You want assets that don&amp;#39;t correlate with each other
-	If 2 investments move in the same direction at the same time, they have positive correlation. If they move in opposite directions, they have negative correlation.
-	You want investments that have lower correlation to each other
-	Don&amp;#39;t purchase new investments that have a high positive correlation with investments you already have
-	Negative correlation is theoretically ideal when selecting investments but this doesn&amp;#39;t occur in the real world. Typically, the best asset pairs you will find are noncorrelated
  - Correlation is measured on a -1 to +1 scale
    - +0.3 or greater is positive
    - -0.3 or less is negative
    - -0.3 to 0.3 is noncorrelated
-	Correlations are dynamic, not static. And you can&amp;#39;t guess when/how they will change. For example – The S+P 500 and Intermediate term treasury bonds have been between +0.49 to -0.42 correlated in the last 20 years (1990-2009). Average was 0 so they are noncorrelated
-	Correlation is not the only reason to invest. The security must also have a positive expected rate of return. It is basically impossible to find 2 negative correlated asset classes that both earn a positive rate of return. Noncorrelated is your best bet
-	You cannot eliminate all risk from a portfolio but you can reduce it
-	You will lose money during some times. Don&amp;#39;t try to market time your way out of it. You can&amp;#39;t
-	Do NOT abandon your plan because you lose money. In the last 50 years the market is up 4 years for every 1 down
-	Owning several asset classes is better than owning a few
-	Choose asset classes that have positive real returns and lower correlation
-	You can select a good asset allocation but not a perfect one. Don&amp;#39;t overanalyze
-	It is not possible to know which asset classes will perform well at any given time, therefore it is important to retain ALL asset classes in your portfolio at all times and to rebalance these annually.
-	The perfect portfolio can only be known in retrospect. So, don&amp;#39;t overanalyze
-	Foreign stocks are great for US investors
  - They do not always move in correlation with the US market
  - They trade in foreign currency which is another diversifier
-	During extreme volatility when you want low correlation among asset classes, positive correlation increases drastically across all classes. Especially during bear markets or disasters
-	There is no known way to design a portfolio that is fully hedged against downturns while fully participating in the upswings
-	Look for mutual funds that have low expense ratios and no redemption fees
-	Prefer index mutual funds and ETF&amp;#39;s
-	Stay away from high cost illiquid investments unless you really know what you are doing
-	You have to stay invested during all market conditions to benefit from the gains

Equities

-	An investment in a total US stock market fund is a solid foundation on which to base a US stock market allocation. Total Index are heavily weighted toward large cap stocks
-	Take your age x 1.5 for your % AA to a TDF. Example. 40 x 1.5 = 60% allocation to TDF
-	Midcap indexes are highly correlated with total stock market indexes and are therefore a poor diversifier. You don&amp;#39;t need them
-	25% max dedicated toward factor tilts
-	If you want to tilt, above all, be patient and stick to your guns. Don&amp;#39;t chase returns. Once you decide to tilt, you need to stick with that strategy and not bailout of it
-	The enemy of a good asset allocation is the quest for a perfect one. Fight the urge to be perfect
-	Study in 1992 By Fama and French – Performance of a broadly diversified US stock portfolio relied on 3 primary risks axis to determine its return. 95% accuracy as to what the portfolio would return
  - Market risk or Beta – all portfolios move up or down in relation to the total stock market
  - Percent of small cap in the portfolio by weight – small stocks have higher returns and do not always have correlation to the total stock market
  - Percent of value orientation – value stocks have a higher return than growth and do not correlate with growth stocks
-	Small cap value index has outperformed growth with less standard deviation from 1979-2009
  - Having a 50/50 value/growth index during this time added no return and increased standard deviation
-	Small cap stocks have higher expected returns but also higher standard deviation than large cap
  - This occurs in foreign markets too
-	Small Cap value along with total stock market is a good choice in your portfolio

International

-	International equity provides currency diversification
-	Global equity invests in both US and international. Not usually a good idea unless you have a very small amount of money want diversification from 1 fund
-	Good idea to have both US AND International equities in your portfolio at all times. You don&amp;#39;t know which one will win. US won from 1970-2001 then International has won since
-	Canada&amp;#39;s economy is weighted heavily toward finance, energy and basic materials. Canada has lots of natural resources and investing in them acts as a hedge against commodity prices
-	A permanent allocation to emerging market stocks is recommended. Emerging markets are very volatile. Recently Emerging markets have increased their correlation to US markets but this may or may not continue
-	Generally, the allocation to international stocks is about 30% of the equity portion of your portfolio
-	Independent studies prove the size and value premium (F+F study above) works in international stocks like it does with US. This means international small cap is a good idea too
-	Foreign stocks are subject to currency, political, trading, custody and regulatory risk. You must understand these risks. But they do provide diversification to a portfolio

Fixed Income

-	A diversified fixed income portfolio enhances return
-	Low-cost bond mutual funds are an ideal way to invest
-	Tax considerations may be an important element in fixed income when investing in a taxable account
-	Bond Structure
  - Short – 3 years or less
  - Intermediate – 4 to 9 years
  - Long – 10+ years
-	Longer term bonds have higher interest rate risk. Longer maturity = higher rates. Opposite true
-	Lower quality bonds have higher credit risk. Lower credit rating = higher rates. Opposite true
-	High yield bonds have not only credit risks but the real danger that the issuers will default
-	Municipal bonds are a good choice for people in higher tax brackets in taxable accounts

REIT

-	Real estate is a separate asset class from stocks and bonds
-	REIT are a convenient way to invest in real estate
-	REITs have low correlation with stocks and bonds
-	Nearly all commercial lease contracts have a built-in inflation hedge. Therefore, REITs are a good inflation hedge
-	REITs are the simplest way to participate in the real estate market. They are also liquid
-	Index Equity REITs and ETFs are a good choice
-	REITs are divided into 3 categories
  - Equity – Real estate properties. Most pure holding
  - Mortgage REITs – do not own property, they finance property. Bond investment
  - Hybrid – Hold both
-	10% allocation to REIT is enough
-	Do not include home equity in your asset allocation models
-	Equity REITs are portfolios of apartments, hotels, malls, industrial buildings, and other rental property

Behavioral

-	Realistic expectations are important to investment planning
-	Market volatility is more predictable than market return
-	Investments with expected positive investment return and higher volatility have higher expected return
-	All investments have risk. Even T-Bills which is inflation risk. There is no risk-free investment
-	No more than 12 funds because it gets too complex with higher fees and diminishing returns
-	Do not change your percentage of equity/bond based on what you think the market will do. Once you select a ratio stick with it.
-	Most people can&amp;#39;t stomach a 100% equity portfolio
-	A well-developed plan works only when the investor sticks to the plan through good and bad times
-	A sensible investment plan never fails an investor, the investor fails the plan
-	People tend to more optimistic about stocks after the market goes up and less after it goes down
-	Investors give too much weight to recent information
-	People tend to buy investments that have had a recent run-up in performance
-	Investors label investments good or bad depending of the price relative to where they bought it
-	Overconfident investors generally believe they have more knowledge and information than they actually do. Therefore, they tend to trade too much and underperform
-	Males tend to be overconfident
-	Females tend to do better at sticking to a long-term plan and usually perform better
-	Do not change your investment strategy during a bear market
-	If you can rebalance without hesitation even during bad markets, your risk tolerance is good
-	Many portfolio failures occur when investors take on too much risk",finance
personalfinance,"Receiving Windfall, How to Invest It","Hey all,

I wanted to reach out to community to see if there are any recommendations that I haven't thought about. In short, it looks as if I'm going to be the recipient of a small windfall from a family member. After taxes, it should be right around $50k. I'm thinking of just sticking it in a taxable brokerage account, investing it in an index fund like VTSAX or VTWAX.

A few things about my other finances:

* I have no debt other than my mortgage, which has an outstanding balance of just over $60k at a rate of 3.05% (no credit card debt, no car loans, etc.)
* My wife and I both max out our 401k's and our backdoor Roth IRA's every year.
* I've already got an emergency fund set up with 12 months of finances in it.

Because I've already got my retirement accounts covered as well as an emergency fund, and my interest rate on my house is so low, I figured sticking it in a taxable brokerage account in a fund that simply tracks the market would be a better way to handle the money than sticking it in a HYSA that's not earning much interest. I don't have any real immediate short-term needs for the money (the only thing I could think of would be if something comes up with the house and I need to pull a portion of that amount of cover the expense).

Is there something I'm missing, or does sticking it in a taxable brokerage account make sense so that the money can grow with the market versus just sitting in a savings account where it won't earn much given the current interest rates?",finance

personalfinance,Add my name to Parents Loan on house?,"My parents (60+ but semi retired) wish to buy another property (They already live in one) to take advantage of the potential housing price reduction timed with the reduced interest rates. They have the ability to buy the house cash, but would prefer to take a loan and invest their additional cash. They expect to keep the house for another 10 to 20 years, and are mainly using it as a means to rent and get extra income. Loan term would probably be 15 years.

Since their actual income and hence their DTI ratio is limited these days, they want to add my name to the loan. I do not own a house and i just started working, and I do not expect to buy a place of my own for another 4 to 5 years. They are doing this so that they can actually get a bank approval.  I have no intention of moving to their location where the house will be (east coast but im in west coast). They say that this will reduce my tax burden, and i will be able to have some equity extra too in 20 years.

The projected mortgage is about 1500 a month, and my parents will cover 1k. They are getting that 1k from various dividends/payouts etc. I am already giving them 500 a month in pocket money and i expect to do so always, and so they said i will just give the 500 to them to use towards the house anyway.

Are there any risks to this? Will that increase my own DTI which may affect myself when i hope to purchase a house in 5 years?",finance
personalfinance,"Where should I park money I'll need in the next ~1.5 years? Market feels too risky, savings account has terrible rate.","My family and I live in a townhouse we're outgrowing and are planning to upsize in the next 12-16 months to a larger and more expensive property. We owe a little less than $460k with an interest rate of 2.68%. We are regularly saving money in an Ally savings account to apply toward the new house (0.5% APY), which we'll sell so we can roll the equity into the new place. 

Here's my question: what's the best thing to do with money I'm saving? At the moment, I'm aware it's actually losing value given that it's sitting earning interest a rate lower than inflation -- so I'm not inclined to leave it with Ally. On the other hand, investing in the market (even a broad index fund) feels a little risky if there's a market correction just when I want to pull it out. My intuition is that the best thing to do would be to use it to pay down my current mortgage (no penalty) -- and that it would be the equivalent of putting it in a savings account earning 2.68%. Do I have that right? Are there any downsides I'm not thinking of or any better options?",finance

personalfinance,Sharing Refinance Quote,"You know we spend a lot of time here talking about the market/investing but not a lot on refinancing. Most of us have a general idea that interest rates are low, but I wanted to share a couple of surprisingly low quotes and what this perceivably translates into.

Today I locked in a rate of 2.3% for a conventional 15-year loan today with a large commercial bank. My friend got a rate of 2.1% for the same loan yesterday (I took a slight hit on multi-family home). Closing costs are about 6k - but 3k of those are escrow related dealing with property taxes and homeowner’s insurance.

So, I have about 17 years left on my current note at 3.25% from a refi done in 2013. If I did my math right, I figure I am saving about 17k just on the principal and interest for the 15 years. But the life of the loan is now shorter and, depending on closing date, I think I will be saving roughly 47k on the months that I will not have to pay due to the refinance - so about 64k in payment-related savings before closing costs.

My advice - go shop rates! You will get a better feel for total costs by calling them vice web searching - and can ask questions about closing costs as well as the rate. Some of these closing costs are wildly different - for instance Navy Federal was charging 2-4% of loan amount (!!).",finance
personalfinance,Should I pay more than the minimum on my student loans?,"Hey y'all,

I just graduated with a Bachelor's in Computer Science and about $17,000 in student loans. All the loans are direct subsidized loans which means there's 0 interest on them for another 4 months (6 months after graduation), then a 3.73% interest rate after that. It seems to me that I'd be better off only paying the minimum every month (even once the interest starts accruing), and investing the rest of my available money in an S&amp;P 500 ETF. The S&amp;P 500 has an average annual return of about 10%, which is significantly higher than the 3.73% accruing on my loans. Thus, I'd be theoretically making more money in the ETF than I'd be losing on the loans. Obviously, it's not a guaranteed return, but I'd be willing to bet that it would be more than 3.73% over time. I'd obviously have to pay the minimum every month (which is $50 if I'm not mistaken) in order to avoid damaging my credit, but paying anything on top of that seems like a mistake to me.

Is this a viable strategy? Is there any angle I'm missing here?",finance

CryptoCurrency,"Elizabeth Warren has proven to be our enemy, but she is only one soldier in the larger army fighting the ""War on Crypto""","TLDR: Fuck Elizabeth Warren and buy more crypto!


To be honest, I used to respect Elizabeth Warren and her views on financial inequality. But with time, unlike a fine wine, that respect did not age well. Like most other politicians, she proved to me that she only acts in the interest of those who fund her campaigns and line her pockets. So let me ask you this Senator Warren, if Bitcoin (and crypto as a whole) is NOT a hedge against inflation, than what is??? Gold? Because the good ole U.S. of A. forbid citizens from owning or trading it for quite a while (Executive Order 6102). The Stock Market? Because the rules are in favor of the financial elite. It is NOT a level playing field for the retail investor. Just put my money in a savings account? Anyone know a bank that offers an interest rate at least equal the the average yearly inflation rate?

As more people turn towards crypto investments, the world governments start taking the threat more seriously. If they can't ban it, the tactic turns toward a way to control it. Regulate it to death, demand KYC on private wallets, make the tax code on crypto overly complex, and threaten citizens with severe and unjust consequences if they don't comply. All of these things only push out the retail investors, thus regaining the control.

Satoshi's vision for Bitcoin (and blockchain tech as a whole) was to deliver freedom to the 99%. Freedom from banks that rob us with fees. Freedom from fiat currencies that eventually inflate to the point where the raw materials that make them are worth than the face value on them. Freedom from government overreach. This is bigger than Lambos and rockets to the moon. It's about true financial freedom. It's time for us to decide what WE determine to have value and consider to be OUR currency (and store of value).

solar,How amateur can your solar set up be and still qualify for the federal tax credit?,"TLDR What is the minimum for the definition of “installed” and “placed in service” to meet the tax credit. 

According to https://www.energy.gov/eere/solar/homeowners-guide-federal-tax-credit-solar-photovoltaics

“A solar PV system does not necessarily have to be connected to the electric grid for you to claim the residential federal solar tax credit, as long as it is generating electricity for use at your residence.”

Also

“ The tax credit is only for systems that were “placed in service” during the year, meaning they are installed and producing electricity for the homeowner.”

 “The solar PV panels located on your property do not necessarily have to be installed on your roof, as long as they generate electricity for use at your residence.”

I’m basically trying to find what you could make that would not require a roof installation and still get the credit. I think a neighbor has panels just on some posts in their yard it has me curious.


Where do meet the tax credit requirements.
If you have everything just have it all on the ground in your yard with an an extension cord?  

Everything in your garage with the panels on a dolly or wagon you can role out?

Panels mounted to a fence with the rest just in your porch?


Some parts like a solar inverter mounted to a wall in your basement?

CryptoCurrency,"I know a lot of you are bullish and bearish, but have you heard of Dovish &amp; Hawkish?","I, for one, never heard this term even after stock trading for nearly a decade. Wanted to spread the info for everyone here :) 

Good info from the blow article: 

https://www.dailyfx.com/education/forex-fundamental-analysis/hawkish-vs-dovish-and-forex-trading.html

WHAT DOES HAWKISH MEAN?
The term hawkish is used to describe contractionary monetary policy. Central bankers can be said to be hawkish if they talk about tightening monetary policy by increasing interest rates or reducing the central bank’s balance sheet. A monetary policy stance is said to be hawkish if it forecasts future interest rate increases. Central bankers can also be said to be hawkish when they are positive about the economic growth outlook and expect inflation to increase.

Currencies tend to move the most when central bankers shift tones from dovish to hawkish or vice versa. For example, if a central banker was recently dovish, stating that the economy still requires stimulus and then, in a later speech, stated that they have seen inflation pressures rising and strong economic growth, you could see the currency appreciate against other currencies.

Some words that could be used describing a hawkish monetary policy include:

Strong economic growth
Inflation increasing
Reducing the balance sheet
Tightening of monetary policy
Interest rate hikes
Generally, words used that indicate increasing inflation, higher interest rates and strong economic growth lean towards a more hawkish monetary policy outcome.

WHAT DOES DOVISH MEAN?
Dovish refers to the opposite. When central bankers are talking about reducing interest rates or increasing quantitative easing to stimulate the economy they are said to be dovish. If central bankers are pessimistic about economic growth and expect inflation to decrease or become deflation and they signal this to the market through their projections or forward guidance, they are said to be dovish about the economy.

Some words that could be used to describe a dovish monetary policy, include:

Weak economic growth
Inflation decreasing/deflation (negative inflation)
Increasing the balance sheet
Loosening of monetary policy
Interest rate cuts",cryptocurrency
CryptoCurrency,Where are they now? Follow up 2 months after: Checking top 10 tokens contract on CryptoMoonShots Sub front page with TokenSniffer,"Hello people, 2 months ago I did a small research [The one on this Link](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/n9py0b/checking_top_10_tokens_contract_on/) using Token Sniffer, which can be found here, I just basically sniffed the top 10 cryptos in the posts of the CryptoMoonShots subreddit. 



I will be doing this again for each of the contracts I researched 2 months ago, it's important to note that 2 months ago, the price of Bitcoin was around 36-38K$, so considering the cost of opportunity as Bitcoin barely moved since then, any token that moved in price up, has been a better investment than BTC, anything that went down, wasn't so good.

A lil introduction, to TokenSniffer as it is still a good tool to have around: 
#What is Token Sniffer?


It is a site that has the idea of trying to help people spot shitty, rugpull tokens. The functionality is pretty easy, you copy the contract of the token you are going to sniff and copy paste it in the search bar of the site, of which you will get a ""small test"" results that show you the following info 


* Is it a verified contract source? This tells you that someone did register and that the code of the contract will be what is being deployed into the blockchain.

* No prior similar token contracts? Tells you if the code behind the contract is similar to other tokens released before, basically if your token is a copy paste from another token that was done in the past. **This one is important**

* Source does not contain a proxy contract? Basically if your contract checks if your contract isn't wrapped on another one that could be used to ""hide"" it's shitty status.

* Source does not contain a pausable contract? Tells you if whoever is in control of the token can pause or not it's transactions.

#Conclusion:

So 2 months after then screening with token sniffer, actually the only one that still appears to be a somewhat decent project is the one I couldn't find with TokenSniffer, the other ones did poorly on the results of the tool, and as you can see, anyone that had invested on them would have been would have been way better investing on Bitcoin which at the time wasn't doing so hot either, 5 out of the 10 tokens had lost more than 75% of its value, with 2 of those being over 90%. 2 of the tokens are lost, don't exist anymore. 



Now the good side, how many were **Moon Shots**? well so far none, but there is one project that seems to be ok, on CocoSwap. 


As you can see, out of the small screeening I did, with only the top 10 cryptos on the front page at the time, it was enough to know that if you go there, it would be better to just go to a casino or something. I myself got tempted by the subreddits when I started getting into crypto, I tried to buy them, but at the time it felt pretty hard to buy the tokens, with the time and the popularisation of PancakeSwap and others it has become easier, but still it won't be a good investment you are more than likely getting scammed.",cryptocurrency

11. The Charles/Lex Fridman podcast has dropped. This is a big deal. This is a fairly mainstream podcast with over 1 million subscribers. [https://youtu.be/FKh8hjJNhWc](https://youtu.be/FKh8hjJNhWc)
12. The bank of England is getting very serious about how it “may wish to limit migration” of money from the legacy system to stablecoins. Wow. Just another example of why it’s such an asset (no pun intended) that Cardano is prepared for regulation. [https://twitter.com/CaitlinLong\_/status/1405712468823842816](https://twitter.com/CaitlinLong_/status/1405712468823842816)

15. It’s a good sign that the top two crypto communities are spending so much time talking negatively about Cardano. You only focus your hatred on that which is most threatening. I’m glad to see we’re the biggest threat on their radar. [https://twitter.com/nic\_\_carter/status/1405194146063736840](https://twitter.com/nic__carter/status/1405194146063736840)

17. All 345,501 of the people who have watched the Lex Fridman/Charles episode as of writing are realizing that Cardano could be the first project to put voting on the blockchain in a U.S. state. [https://www.atalaprism.io/app](https://www.atalaprism.io/app)
18. It looks like the second biggest ETH stakepool or it's custody provider has lost it’s users private keys to $75MM in ETH. Cardano doesn’t have this problem. We get to keep custody of our crypto because we found a better way than slashing. [https://stakehound.com/blog-post/fireblocks-eth-2-key-management-incident/](https://stakehound.com/blog-post/fireblocks-eth-2-key-management-incident/) [https://twitter.com/JamesSpediacci/status/1407465311180255236](https://twitter.com/JamesSpediacci/status/1407465311180255236)

21. The June Cardano 360 is currently available on Youtube. [https://youtu.be/al5m14299ww](https://youtu.be/al5m14299ww)
22. We saw segments on various newer partner entities like Nervos, Orion Protocol, and Revuto. Nervos is a UTXO proof-of-work blockchain which is building a cross-chain bridge with Cardano so that you can use your ADA on Nervos dApps and vice versa. Interoperability is a big theme for Nervos and they plan to have a working testnet within a month. Orion Protocol is building a terminal that will allow for decentralized non-custodial trading across centralized and decentralized exchanges. They say this would not require you to KYC or even have an account with any of these exchanges. Revuto is an online subscription management service that recently completed a $10MM token sale on Cardano.
23. It was also revealed that Wolfram Labs, COTI, and IOHK have a three-way partnership (a ménage à tech) to build an NFT auction site. The people from Wolfram were talking about very interesting things including live minting during streaming events and automated upload to IPFS. COTI will be building out auction and bidding mechanisms in ADAPay.
24. Professor Aggelos Kiayias gave us an update on research including that Ouroboros Chronos and Hydra papers have both been accepted into conferences/journals. Chronos will provide Cardano with a global concept of time that doesn’t rely on any outside timekeeper. Prof. Kiayias also pointed out that Hydra is distinguishable from other layer two protocols in that the scripting language is identical to that of the base layer in Cardano such that any dApp that can run on Cardano will run on the Hydra L2. This is a huge plus and superior to many other layer two solutions in other ecosystems where the base layer dApps will not run on layer two. Finally, the Mithril paper has been submitted for peer review. It will provide Cardano light wallets with Succinct Non-interactive Arguments of Knowledge that will give us the best of both worlds: no delays for syncing as in full node wallets while still preserving trustlessness.
25. Finally, the Goguen Summit will be in late September. Sign up now at [summit.cardano.org](http://summit.cardano.org/).
26. The Fed is once again STRONGLY signalling to us that they are going to regulate stablecoins. The Fed is also specifically calling out Tether for the first time. You need to be thinking about how stablecoin regulation might affect your favorite Cardano DeFi or other project. [https://twitter.com/CaitlinLong\_/status/1408500265397985282](https://twitter.com/CaitlinLong_/status/1408500265397985282) [https://twitter.com/CaitlinLong\_/status/1408572624125534212](https://twitter.com/CaitlinLong_/status/1408572624125534212)
27. People are starting to realize that the Stakehound private key loss in ETH may attract unwanted regulatory attention to Ethereum 2.0 while this problem could never have occurred in Cardano. Also, only a few days later another ETH stakepool (this time SharedStake...the sixth biggest ETH Stakepool) allegedly experiences a rugpull that some are valuing at over $30MM. This is another problem that could not happen in Cardano staking. It feels like we stepped into the ring, they rang the bell, and ETH just started punching itself in the head. Eventually it’s going to KO itself.

29. John O’Connor of IOHK points out that France still controls the monetary policy of 14 countries in Africa.

42. Robert Kornacki of dcSpark releases an article on why every Cardano dApp will use NFTs. The article contains some very interesting discussion on smart contracts in the EUTXO context including language instructing that “UTXOs have smart contracts attached to them and not the other way around” and “\[...\]the simplest way to think about it is that when a UTXO is created it has the option to have a smart contract attached to it.” [https://medium.com/dcspark/every-eutxo-dapp-will-use-nfts-and-heres-why-fd87e6a8c9a6](https://medium.com/dcspark/every-eutxo-dapp-will-use-nfts-and-heres-why-fd87e6a8c9a6)

69. In news that could have significant repercussions for many stablecoin reliant Cardano DeFi projects, Fed Chair Jerome Powell gave some hard signals that they will regulate stablecoins in House Committee testimony. He revealed that the Fed will issue its long-awated paper on stablecoins, CBDCs, and other digital assets in September. Powell also went as far as to say ""You wouldn't need stable coins you wouldn't need cryptocurrencies if you had a digital US currency, I think that's one of the stronger arguments in its favor.""

88. Notable news for upcoming Cardano DeFi projects. There may be slightly less competition in the “get a return on your crypto assets” game very soon. The New Jersey AG’s office has delivered a cease and desist letter to BlockFi. The AG’s press release cited BlockFi’s interest bearing deposit accounts as unregistered securities and also mentioned the lack of FDIC or SPIC insurance for it’s depositors. This leaves some lingering questions for Cardano DeFi projects that might be planning to accept deposits or other transfers of value and offering a return of sorts. You could argue that these projects are decentralized where BlockFi was not. But, the AG’s press release seems to cite decentralization as one of the risks of DeFi projects. Also, as a practical matter, there is a question whether decentralization will be a good shield from regulators since many of these projects have companies and real humans with faces and names behind them unlike a truly anonymous founder such as Satoshi Nakamoto.

personalfinance,Student loan debt I can’t pay or refinance,"My parents co-signed for a ~150k student loan in 2015. I’ve been denied refinancing at multiple companies because my income to debt ratio is too high. I currently make ~35k a year, looking for new jobs though because I’m starting to resent the one I’m at. 
My rent is $640, I have a PayPal credit payment of minimum $50 a month, apple credit payment for my computer at $54 a month. No car payment though, which is good. My current lender’s interest rate is adding $54.20 a day onto my existing loans.
I’m so overwhelmed, I have no idea where to start. I was a child when I agreed to this, I can’t help but feel resentful towards a system that would allow a child to sign away their life. But we’re well beyond that, at this point. 

I’m about to go into repayment, and I’m living paycheck to paycheck. I realize my options here are to get a second job, or default and wreck me and my parents credit. I’m worried about taking on another job, because the one I currently work is very physical labor, and I get up at 4 every day. I don’t know how much my body will be able to handle. My friend might have a lead for delivering pizza or something but that’s my only realistic option right now.

CryptoCurrency,I choose DeFi over banks.,"If it wasn't for Defi I would not have a fair chance. 

I have perfect credit, no debts to my name but I cannot get a credit card or loan, and they banks won't tell me why. I'm 33 and not had a personal loan from a bank, or a credit card. Not by choice. I live in a first world country. 

Defi allows me to get loans without question, it allows me to store my money somewhere with better interest rates. It has given me a chance that the establishment hasn't allowed me to. 

Because of this, 80% my wage goes into Crypto as coins or stable coins and it goes straight into Defi. The other 20% is turned into straight cash. I am left with ~$5 in my bank per fortnight. 

This isn't the most practical thing to do because of the volatility nature of crypto, and I do not recommend it as some times it causes issues in terms of prices dropping. But its about the principal, the vindictiveness I have towards banks. The banks don't allow me to have money, so I do not allow them to have mine. 

There are risks to aspects of Defi of course, but Defi hasn't turned the world upside down or caused a global financial crisis. It has given opportunities that were not once there. 

DeFi is an equaliser and that is why the media is now attacking it. Its not perfect, but it is a thorn in the side of the establishment. 

Support Defi, turn your backs on the banks because they don't have yours. Make your money work for you, not for them, support p2p lending and do not finance the criminal nature of banks, do not support a establishment that uses your money to launder cartel money or that lobbies Governments to hurt you even more.",cryptocurrency

dogecoin,Why I think Gemini Earn will be a scam and will hurt many people.,"A few points to make as a premise:

1. Gemini has partnered with a crypto lender called Genesis to earn their users interest on customer Earn deposits. [https://www.coindesk.com/gemini-crypto-lender-genesis-yield-on-customer-deposits](https://www.coindesk.com/gemini-crypto-lender-genesis-yield-on-customer-deposits)
2. Genesis is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group.
3. Digital Currency Group's founder and CEO is the one and only Barry Silbert.

So the question you need to ask yourself is: Given Barry's obvious inclination that DOGE will be going down, why would his company be borrowing DOGE at an interest rate through Gemini?

The obvious answer is that they are using the borrowed DOGE to short the market trying to drive down the price.

This can go one of two ways.

1. They short DOGE successfully and the price goes down
2. They fail and DOGE takes off to the moon.

In scenario 1 the implications are simple, the price goes down and the Earn users have more coins but with less value.

***Here is where it gets interesting.***

In scenario 2 Genesis Lending will be out **BIG** money, not only would they need to pay back the DOGE they borrowed at a higher price but also the 7.4% interest accrued. From a retail investor point of view this sounds great right? Well, in the terms and conditions of Gemini Earn ([https://www.gemini.com/legal/gemini-earn-program-terms-and-authorization-agreement#section-1-program-risks](https://www.gemini.com/legal/gemini-earn-program-terms-and-authorization-agreement#section-1-program-risks)) in line item 1. it says your assets are at risk, they are not insured and the risks can include up to total loss of your digital assets. So what happens if Genesis Lending is out huge money if they lose the shorting game and cant afford to cover their losses. What happens if they have to file bankruptcy. IF that happened, any DOGE that was deposited in Gemini Earn you would not be able to get back. The terms and conditions would specifically protect Gemini in this circumstance since Earn users have to agree to the risk of losing all their assets when they sign up for the Earn program.

I'm not saying this is guaranteed to happen and I'm not trying to create unnecessary FUD, but this scenario playing out is possible and could be detrimental to many. It's my opinion that you should just keep all your coins on a hardware wallet, that's the only real way to guarantee they are protected.

TLDR: IF the DOGE community is successful and goes to the moon, its possible the lenders partnered with Gemini Earn will not be able to cover their losses and you could lose all your coins that are deposited in Gemini Earn. To keep your coins safe, just put it in a hardware wallet.

CryptoCurrency,"Congressman says helicopter money is killing the U.S dollar, CBDC can be the solution","During a Congressional hearing regarding central bank digital currency on Tuesday, the prospect of China setting the norm and deploying the digital yuan for cross-border payments as well as China’s capacity to monitor was extensively debated.

Congressman Patrick McHenry expressed worry, stating that “if we do not act as Americans, international settlements and remittances may go to a regime that we do not like”. Democrat Congressman Jake Auchincloss had the same stance as McHenry,

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;I found the case for CBDCs for geo-economic and strategic purposes very compelling. And I understand why the United States needs to catch up, both to retain its economic leverage, retain the U.S. dollar as the (global) reserve currency.

&amp;#x200B;

There are many arguments against helicopter money. Most economists and investors fear that, unlike QE, helicopter money is harder to drain from the system and the excess money could spur long-term inflation over time however far-fetched that may seem in the current environment. Davidson stated,

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;There’s a coveting of the power that China would have by being able to create this creepy surveillance tool. Of being able to know everything about every person, including every transaction and, honestly, the capacity to filter such transactions via the state’s power. I suppose if you’re a statistician, you’d appreciate that tool

&amp;#x200B;

Davidson then went on to express his concerns about negative interest rates and how the Federal Reserve might potentially place expiry dates on people’s savings accounts. He concluded that a CBDC would have to operate without the requirement for authorisation.

In short, he was talking up the Sunny Boy XX00TL-US which has (from the flier) ""Shade management with OptiTrac Global Peak MPP tracking.""  The claim that he was making is that this allowed the string inverter to act more like micro-inverters (with regard to shaded panels) and less like traditional string inverters, where the entire array would produce less.  

The reason to go for the Sunny Boy over the micro-inverters is that I could use the outlet provided by the Sunny Boy during a power outage and during the daytime with up to 2,000 watts being provided.  Honestly, I probably wouldn't use that feature because the three times I've lost power here in the last 15 years has been due to a bad storm and the power was back up before the clouds cleared.  But, that is an added bonus IF the Sunny Boy really does handle shade just as well as micro-inverters.

So the question is, does the Sunny Boy really handle shade better than traditional string inverters?  Or should I stick to micro-inverters?

## U.S. GDP Trails Forecast Even as Consumer Spending Surges

(Bloomberg)  -- U.S. growth missed forecasts in the second quarter as the effects of  supply-chain constraints reverberated through the economy and took the  shine off one of the biggest gains in consumer spending in decades.

Gross  domestic product expanded at a 6.5% annualized rate following a revised  6.3% pace in the first quarter, the Commerce Department’s preliminary  estimate showed Thursday. Federal government outlays, residential  investment and inventories weighed on the figure.

Personal consumption, the biggest part of the economy, advanced an annualized 11.8%.

The  inflation-adjusted value of domestically produced goods and services  climbed to an annualized $19.36 trillion, eclipsing its pre-pandemic  peak.

The median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of economists  called for an 8.4% increase in second-quarter GDP. Stock-index futures  climbed after the report, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose  and the dollar weakened.

Emboldened by vaccinations, federal  financial relief and a broader reopening of the economy, Americans had  both the wherewithal and the opportunity to ramp up spending on services  such as dining out. The extra cash paired with robust hiring helped  sustain outlays for merchandise as well.

Looking ahead, economic  growth will be challenged by waning government support and lingering  supply and labor constraints. At the same time, the rapidly spreading  delta variant of Covid-19 present risks to the spending outlook.

- there was a lot of complaints about how the federal government has just been pumping Usd into the economy and that inflation is on the rise. Totally agree this is a concern, but it was in response to a global pandemic that shut down the economy in a way we had never seen before. If we pretend Btc has replaced Usd as the predominant currency of choice how exactly would Btc have helped the people massively struggling? I am a secure office worker that got to work from home and was able to be fine through Covid so I didn’t need help. But what about the working poor that might have lost their jobs and needed that stimulus to pay for food or rent?

gaming,Should I keep playing high spec games on console or low spec PC?,"Hey all. To give some context here I currently have a PlayStation 4 and a Surface Studio desktop computer for my work. I don’t currently have the budget or means for a higher quality computer, but I have a pretty intensive digital catalogue for both systems. 

As it stands I’m thinking of sticking to getting the more high spec games on PlayStation 4, where I know they’ll be able to work fine. Yet I’m also wondering if I should get them on Steam instead, as part of me wonders if I may be able to get a higher spec computer down the line that I know can run the games that I enjoy.  It may be a long shot, but at least on Steam the games are practically future proofed. 

Incidentally my Studio has also had some problems running low spec indies as well, which makes me wonder if I’d be better off getting them on PS4 as well, where I at least know they could also run on next gen hardware there as well. That or the Switch Lite, which I could likely afford at Thai time and where I know there’s a plethora of low spec indies. 

Maybe it’s a bit ridiculous to be thinking this far ahead on non-existent possibilities, but I thought it’d be at least worth airing out for some commentary, so please feel free to give any input. I would genuinely appreciate it.",technology

CryptoCurrency,I finally convinced my father to start investing in Crypto,"My father (who is an engineer btw) would listen to my rants on the benefits of crypto but has refused to invest in it up until this point. I tried to convince him to DCA in to BTC in the past, but he told me he would only buy BTC when it ""hits 20k."" He doesn't believe in the technology yet, and BTC could drop but it's obviously much more safe to start averaging in.

It was honestly pretty frustrating, and worst thing was when my father told me he intended to put a lot of money in to Gold. I had explained a variety of advantages that BTC &amp; crypto in general has over hard assets, but he just wouldn't listen to me. Even though he knows what BTC and ETH are and how they work, I was trying to convince him to invest in something that was just too alien to him. I was starting to feel like I had failed my dad, but just yesterday when I was randomly looking at interest rates on BlockFi, I discovered **PAX Gold**

For those who don't know (like me yesterday), PAX Gold is stablecoin backed 1:1 by physical gold so that the price of one PAXG is always equal to the price of one ounce of gold. Paxos is a regulated company and the physical gold can be redeemed at any time if you so wish. I was a little giddy when I found out about this because it was the perfect coin to introduce my father to the world of crypto.

With the simple argument of ""*you can invest in gold but also get 7.5% APR on it*,"" I was able to finally convince my dad to start investing in crypto. He was also enticed by the negligent transaction fees, lack of yearly holding fees of any kind, and the ease of transfer/withdrawal.  While I would love for him to invest in other coins, just dipping his toes in the water is surely enough to get him interested in other projects in the future. 

I see a lot of posts about older relatives denigrating or misunderstanding crypto, and I have experienced the same. Crypto is a relatively new and complicated technology so that can scare a ton of people off, and when it concerns money people tend to invest in things they know. Grandiose arguments have little effect when people are unfamiliar with or skeptical of the basic technology and implications. Exposing ""boomers"" (or any other age group for that matter) to a form of crypto that they can easily understand &amp; grasp is the best way to combat this FUD. While my dad may not immediately invest in other coins, PAXG will provide a perfect opportunity for him to get involved on his terms. Let's hope that he gets the crypto bug!",cryptocurrency

I have debt that I have to take care of but I also want to ensure I invest my money and live comfortably as well. Here are is a breakdown of my current financial situation: 
Student Loan: $46k (refinanced recently at 2.9% over 7 years)

It’ll take a few months to be sure if substantial progress is made, and the process towards actually tapering will be gradual. The Fed will be very transparent and telegraph their intentions well ahead of time to avoid surprising the market.

On another note, the fact that China’s securities regulator convened a virtual meeting with major investment banks, including a few foreign ones, to reassure them that the crackdown on education firms is targeted and not intended to hurt other sectors is telling. Any panic selling in the broader market will be met with support from the government as a collapsing market is not something that they want.

The bottle told me to mix 1 teaspoon(5ml) per 5 pounds of of weight with food or water, so I mixed up two bowls for my cats last night. One had 2 teaspoons (10ml) for my 8lb cat and the other had 3 teaspoons (15ml) for my 14lb cat (I rounded up because it didn't come with a syringe. I used my measuring spoons). 

&amp;#x200B;

I tried feeding them their doses separately but my roommate let the 8lb cat into the room where I had fed the 14lb cat. I think my 8lb cat may have eaten some or all of the 14lb cat's food. She's been acting sleepy and dazed today (after around 6-8 hours of dosing). She's not having any other symptoms. Should I be concerned? 

&amp;#x200B;

If she had eaten both bowls completely, it would be 5 teaspoons(25ml) she's ingested. If it's equivalent to 110mg piperazine base per teaspoon(5ml), then it would be 550mg of piperazine base. I read that ""[In dogs and cats single oral doses ≥110 mg/kg can already cause slight adverse drug reactions; ≥800 mg/kg cause neurotoxic symptoms.](https://parasitipedia.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=2714&amp;Itemid=3022)"" I don't think that makes her fall into the neurotoxic zone, but I'd rather know for sure.

Bitcoin,A Bitcoin world is an inevitability.,"I've been here for a long time. This sub is where I first discovered BTC back in 2011.

It immediately piqued my interest because, at the time, I recognized it as something new, we've never been able to do what bitcoin does. I did a bit of research and discovered what settlement networks are and how they are the plumbing of the global financial system.

The world runs on a few simple rules. One of them, is that people seek out things that are faster and cheaper. By all accounts, bitcoin fits this bill, and beats the legacy financial system's settlement times and price.

We now have the lightning network that is offering faster and cheaper payments globally 24/7.

Despite this, I see this sub explode when a politician makes a negative comment about bitcoin.

It does't matter what politicians do. They are along for the ride and will succumb to their own hubris. Central banks have lost their monopoly on monetary policy and money creation. The banks have lost their monopoly on payment networks. Bitcoin averages 80% year over year. They have no hope they have simply become redundant because they are slower and more expensive. People will simply abandon them because bitcoin will be the more superior solution for global commerce. The war was over before it even begun so to speak.

With that, comes the collapse of the governments. We all see what inflation is doing at over 5% a month. The RRP market is pushing over a trillion dollars, which to me, looks like the system is on the verge of collapse.

When you see the disaster coming and you know what the solution is, you have a responsibility to the ones that don't. You have to drag them into the future kicking and screaming. You need to build a better world than the one we have.

You won't be able run off into the woods to avoid the churn. We have to work together to build something that works fairly for everyone.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Is the interest rate more important or the total cost?,"When deciding for different mortgages, at the fixed-rate phase which is 2yrs or 5yrs typically, do we have to check the total cost for the fixed rate term or the interest rate?
For example here are two offers:

Lender A:
2.04 initial rate, £592 monthly. Fee £1000 - £500 cashback.
Total cost after 2 years: £14,708

Lender B:
2.44 initial rate, £620 monthly. 
No Fee - £1000 cashback. 
Total cost after 2 years: £13,880


Lender A has lower interest rate and the monthly payment is cheaper but with the initial fees it turns out more expensive in total term. 

For the second lender the interest is more but with the initial rates it is cheaper in total.

My question is, should we stick to the lower interest rates or i should consider lower total costs?

If I pay less interest does that mean I have more equity at the end of the term?  So the Lender A is better in long term?! 

I just need some clarity in this.

stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Thursday, July 29, 2021","**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, July 29, 2021**

Despite some volatility earlier in the week, stocks firmly rose today as market participants looked beyond slightly disappointing GDP and jobs data and the Federal Reserve’s July Monetary Policy, which showed no changes but did indicate members are increasingly considering the potential timeline to taper quantitative easing (QE). In my opinion, the fact that markets continue to shrug off volatility to charge higher shows great relative strength and signals that market participants remain willing and able to buy dips. 

The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) both recorded fresh all-time highs, closing 0.4% and 0.42% higher respectively. The Nasdaq (QQQ) is right under its own record high and closed the day 0.18% higher. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, outperformed again, closing 0.77% higher.

Today, the US Bureau of Economic Analysis released its advanced estimate of second-quarter gross-domestic-product (GDP) growth. Despite accelerating from the first-quarter, economists were largely expecting a higher jump, despite consumer spending, the largest component of US economic activity, beating expectations. However, it seems market participants were not fazed. Here are the numbers:

* **Q2 GDP, seasonally adjusted annualized quarter-over-quarter:** 6.5% vs. 8.4% expected and a downwardly revised 6.3% in Q1
* **Personal consumption:** 11.8% vs. 10.5% expected and 11.4% in Q1
* **Core personal consumption expenditures, quarter-over-quarter:** 6.0% vs. 6.1% expected and an upwardly revised 2.7% in Q1

Market participants are digesting the Federal Reserve’s July Monetary Policy Report, released yesterday, which largely reiterated what members of the Fed have been saying for months, but did include some new language hinting that the economic recovery is getting closer to the Fed’s stated goals. The statement read, “Last December, the Committee indicated that it would continue to increase its holdings of Treasury securities by at least $80 billion per month and of agency mortgage‑backed securities by at least $40 billion per month until substantial further progress has been made toward its maximum employment and price stability goals. Since then, the economy has made progress toward these goals, and the Committee will continue to assess progress in coming meetings.” In other words, the Fed says substantial progress has been made and that in the coming months, we will increasingly begin to hear more about a timeline to taper quantitative easing. 

On inflation, the statement largely reiterated what it has in months past. The statement read, “Inflation has risen, largely reflecting transitory factors. Overall financial conditions remain accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses” and “The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. With inflation having run persistently below this longer-run goal, the Committee will aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and longer‑term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent. The Committee expects to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these outcomes are achieved.”

However, the report did acknowledge potential risks and stated the Fed was ready to act if “appropriate risks arise”. The statement read, “In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals. The Committee's assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on public health, labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.”

Amazon (AMZN) absolutely smashed earnings, posting probably the most impressive quarter I have ever seen. Despite this, the stock is currently down 5% after some analysts raised concerns about a slowdown in growth moving forward due to reopenings and difficult comparisons. Personally, with numbers like this, I am going to snap up any dip if it continues tomorrow. Here are the numbers:

* **Revenue:** $115.06 billion expected versus $88.91 billion in Q2 2020
* **EPS:** $15.75 expected versus $10.30 in Q2 2020
* **AWS revenue:** $14.18 billion expected versus $10.81 billion in Q2 2020

In other news, the Labor Department Weekly Unemployment Report came in higher than expected. Here are the numbers 

* **New Jobless Claims:** 400,000 vs 385,000 expected
* **Continuing Claims:** 3.269 million vs 3.183 million expected

**Highlights**

* Yesterday, shares of Facebook (FB), which recently joined the $1 trillion market-cap club, fell after the company warned of a “significant slowdown” in growth moving forward and suggested that Apple’s (AAPL) newest iOS app-tracking update, which let’s users opt out of having apps track their activity outside their own platform, would negatively impact their core advertising business. Here are the numbers
   * **Earnings:** $3.61 per share, adjusted, vs. $3.03 per share as expected\\
   * **Revenue:** $29.08 billion, vs. $27.89 billion as expected by analysts
   * **Daily active users (DAUs):** 1.91 billion, vs. 1.91 billion as expected
   * **Monthly active users (MAUs):** 2.90 billion, vs. 2.91 billion as expected
   * **Average revenue per user (ARPU):** $10.12, vs. $9.66 as expected 
* PayPal (PYPL) also reported earnings, which were largely in-line with expectations. As a result, stock fell roughly 5% today. Personally, that move seems a little overdone to me.
* Today was the highly anticipated IPO of Robinhood (HOOD), popular brokerage that has garnered a horrendous reputation among many retail traders, particularly those who invest in “meme stocks”. Like I have said before, personally not touching that stock with a 10-foot pole, too many dynamics at play. But it will still be fun to keep track of.
* President Biden on Thursday called for state and local governments to make $100 payments to every newly vaccinated American as authorities race to stem the newest wave of Covid-19 cases. 
* Trevor Milton, founder and former CEO of Nikola Motors, the truck, hydrogen start-up that turned out to be a fraud, was charged with defrauding investors.

personalfinance,Using multiple savings/money market accounts and auto-transfers to help with budgeting?,"I'm banking with Ally and I have a checking (with direct deposit), saving, and money market account. To help separate my budget and monthly expenses like rent I was thinking about having automatic withdrawals from my checking each payday to my savings/mma and having those services withdraw directly from those accounts so I can more clearly see how much disposable income I have. I'm just starting managing my money so I don't know what my average spending is yet. Plus I'm still furnishing my apartment so I still have occasional large expenses that I don't want to trick me into being unable to pay my rent.

But since each has a monthly withdrawal limit of 6 and I want to save those withdrawals for emergencies and other saving goal withdrawals (using Ally's buckets system), I was thinking of opening additional savings accounts so I can have more withdrawal ability (and higher interest rates as a bonus for when that money is sitting doing nothing). I want to immediately take what I need to save for rent, insurance, or other predictable expenses each paycheck and move it into a separate account. 

Ally says they have no limit for the number of accounts, but is this abusing the system or something? Seems like it bypasses the 6 withdrawal limit restriction put in place for probably some valid reason.",finance

Now, since our house has increased to be worth $200K another person told me to ""take all that free money"".  But this doesn't make sense to me, there's no such thing as free money.  So after looking into it, I assume this (not so close) friend of mine was talking about a ""cash out refinance"".

My second question is - how the heck would this work?  If I refinanced using the $200K current market value, wouldn't I just have a new $200K loan?

economy,The case for requiring students to learn financial literacy,"Well written curriculum that teaches our high schoolers fundamentals of financial literacy will HELP make a HUGE POSITIVE CHANGE in USA!

When students are signing up for a student loan in college, they should know what they are signing up for, what the consequences will be, and what they should expect. If they understand interest rates, income, and budgeting, they’ll be able to make better decisions and plan for their future. They would be happier, and our economy would flourish, when young adults are able to spend and invest wisely. This would make a positive impact on the poor, the rich, and the middle class. No matter who you are, where you are, or what you are doing you will benefit just by being in a country where the students are taught financially literacy and as a result the economy is constantly strong for everyone!

Many students come from a family where their parents do not have financial literacy and as a result both the parents and children suffer because of it. Many students are from different countries where they will be the first generation of Americans and there is no one to teach them the right and wrong ways of personal finances.

Teaching financial literacy will help students in the future and immediately at home. Teaching student’s financial literacy would help their lives and their whole family because the students will go home from school and explain financial concepts to their parents. As a result, the parents would make better decisions and the family would be less focused on how to pay off credit card debt and more focused on improving their communities. They can help improve their own lives and their parents lives with just one class. If in the future, we have a financial crises a generation filled with financial literate kids will have an easier time fixing and making needed economic changes than adults who had to learned it by themselves and may have learned incorrect or have incomplete information.

One teacher put it this way:

“I teach high school economics in LAUSD and these classes are becoming more popular, however, they are delivered as units within the Economics class that all seniors take. The one used at my school is called Junior Achievement Finance Park and it covers basic financial literacy skills like credit cards, car loans, etc. At the end of the program, under normal/non COVID circumstances, the kids get to go to an in-person simulation where they are given a profile/identity and a budget and must figure out how to live on that budget. It’s pretty cool and the kids seem to appreciate it.”

As a final note, if we do not equip our future with financially smart and literate people, we will suffer from it because as they make bad decisions it falls on the rest of society to help fix and pick up the tab. This drags our country down instead of allowing our country to flourish!",finance

Currently: $580/month payment, maturity date = 12/2025, interest rate = 7.9% balance = $24,558 

Offer: $410/month payment, maturity date = 12/2027, interest rate = 4% balance = $26,208

I currently am paying $700/month, the additional going to the principal. 

I would like to pay the car off as quick as possible, while lowering the total interest I am paying.

I am not sure how the interest plays into my math, but just taking my balance and dividing by the amount I am paying monthly, it looks like the loan would be paid off at roughly the same time, 35-37 months, but I am thinking the lower interest rate, and paying more into the principal would ultimately be the way to go. 


I am also wondering if my warranties (20 year, 200.000 miles) would be impacted at all. Kia offers 10 year, 100,000, but my dealership, in California offered 20/200K, so I am not sure if that is factored in at all. I am waiting to hear back from the dealership.

personalfinance,How to handle unusual pediatric billing,"My son recently had eye surgery and the pediatric ophthalmologist's office sent us a bill about a week before the surgery that seemed a little suspect. It was a typed note that basically said ""We contacted your insurance and they said your deductible is $X for the upcoming procedure. Please pre-pay this amount."" I'm not trying to dodge payment but any time I've received a medical bill that involves my insurance I receive an itemized, coded bill that says ""we asked the insurance for $X, they paid $Y, you owe us $Z"". I didn't pre-pay for the surgery and during the follow up visit I asked them for the itemized bill they sent to the insurance. They administrative assistant huffed and puffed, made a call to their billing team, and said ""the note we sent you is what we have on file. This is what you owe."" I told them I just want to see what my insurance told them before I make payment, to which they said ""do you want to setup a payment plan?"" I repeated myself and started to feel like a stubborn jerk, but I know once money leaves my pocket it's never coming back, so I just want to make sure I'm paying the right amount.

They said they'd follow up with me and when I went home I checked my insurance (Blue Cross) website and there was no claim for this procedure as of today, so I don't know what's going on. I haven't been sent an explanation of benefits from BCBS and this ""bill"" from the office seemed strange. Am I crazy or should I wait until my insurance company tells me how much I owe the office? I just don't want to write a check for $X amount only to end up having to fight to get some part of it back if they billed me incorrectly or something.",finance
CryptoCurrency,What the heck is Decentralization? Why is it Important?,"Decentralization is one of those words that people say around the cryptoverse when they want to sound like they know what they’re talking about. Most often, I see it mentioned in passing as sort of a “and of course, it’s decentralized” without actually going into what it is and how it plays a part. Here is an attempt to explain what I believe is one of the most important ideals to hold in the fight for a fairer, more transparent world.

**What is Decentralization?**  

Here’s the long and wordy definition: 

**Decentralization** is the transfer of authority and responsibility for public functions from the central government to subordinate or quasi-independent government organizations and/or the private sector.

In a nutshell, when things are centralized, only one or a few people have the power to make the final decision. When things are decentralized, the collective(or people designated by the collective) have the power.

Bitcoin is decentralized because there are many miners/node runners in many different locations and from many different backgrounds. No small group can make the decision to change the blockchain or alter the monetary policy(like going from 21 million max supply to 22 million).  It would cost billions of dollars to take control of the network(51% attack) and even then the 49% can hard fork and invalidate everything you did to gain control.

Ethereum is decentralized for the same reasons, but in the change to Proof of Stake, it will switch to more of a model where the average person designates a validator to make decisions. Some will say that PoS is more centralized, some will say it is less centralized. Another topic for another day.

**Why is Decentralization Important?**

This is something that wasn’t super intuitive to me and it seemed like everyone used “Decentralization” in slightly different ways.

Bluntly, Decentralization is important for Crypto assets because financial systems cannot be fair if they are centralized. The banks/politicians can always print more money because they have Central authority over the supply. They can always change the rules, and we have to trust them that they both know what they're doing and are doing it fairly.

What has happened is that instead of allowing markets to take shape, to grow exponentially and to fail hard(but not too hard), they have set the system up in ways to appear prosperous. Distributed human decision-making is playing less and less a part in the capitalism we know today. This is, in large part, what led to the 2008 financial crisis. The problems got so bad that they couldn’t hide them and couldn't do anything to stop the catastrophic cascade.

When we allow markets/industries/banks to fail, we are allowing the system to repair itself. As humans we learn much more from mistakes than from victories. It’s for that reason that crypto assets are uniquely suited to solve the centralization problem. Everyone participating has skin in the game and the punishment for being a bad actor is not in question. If you try to pass false transactions you are programmatically crushed. As an Ether holder, you cheer when a bad acting validator gets slashed. You don’t have to watch the news to tell you that even though the economy crashed, nobody is going to jail and all the bad actors are being bailed out. You know for a fact that they cannot escape their punishment.

These Crypto Assets are primarily matters of incentivization. They operate under the assumption that, if an avenue exists to make money that is to the detriment of all other actors, it will be exploited. They are designed to not only limit those avenues, but to heavily incentivize being a good actor and to heavily disincentivize being a bad actor.

Imagine a world in which politicians are elected based on smart contracts that represent their platforms. If they’re elected, those smart contracts take effect and money is allocated exactly where the voters want it to be AND it’s provable because it is on the blockchain. We would not have to rely on the shaky ability of human beings to judge someone’s character based on sound bites and prepared speeches. If their smart contract is good, they have no choice but to be good.

I realize this got a little ranty, but I think it’s something everyone should think a little bit about. Please leave a comment and let me know what you think.",cryptocurrency

solar,solar prices over time?,"This question is to people working in the solar industry who have been educated about solar component pricing for the last 3 to 5 years or longer.

I'm wondering about what solar prices might do once the federal tax credit is gone.  I believe that panel prices will go down, but has there been a downward trend in pricing for microinverters, or in optimizers and inverters, or in racking materials?

I have been planning a system that I'm planning on installing myself and I'm noticing that panels are about half the cost of the system and whether I go with enphase microinverters or if I go with solaredge optimizers and inverters, those components alongside the racking accounts for the second half of the cost.

I'm coming to the conclusion that if in the future panel prices dive to 50% of what they are today, my overall system cost will still only go down by 25%.  The power conversion and racking hardware needs to get cheaper too before post-rebate prices are more attractive than current prices after a rebate is applied.",energy

personalfinance,Home Equity/Loans question re: Aging Grandparent,"My grandfather is getting on in years, and is a Navy vet.

His Navy pension isn't stretching quite as far as it used to, so I've offered to 'buy' his house (he will still live in it unless/until he needs the longer term care of a nursing home, etc., he will take the cash and I will pay the mortgage).

As he will be the one primarily living in it, and I would prefer to pay primary-residence mortgage rates, my thought was to have him take out a 15-year loan, 'pay' himself and I will act as the co-signer (as my income and credit score are substantially higher), with the house willed to me. He is 81, and of sound mind.

(presume that I trust my grandfather here that I don't feel the need to take the title to the home)

He also qualifies for better rates as a Naval veteran, of which I'd doubly love to take advantage.

Is there anything that smells like mortgage fraud here? Should he pass on, can I take over the mortgage or would it be required to have the debt paid out of his estate prior to disposition? If I did take it over, would I be required to refinance as I myself am not a veteran and do not qualify for veteran status?

ETA: In terms of disposition, I'm in his will as the executor of the estate already and the sole recipient of the house; the only person realistically in contention for it would be my mother - who I'm not super worried about - and an uncle in another country (who is in the will separately for half the equity for grandfather's summer home up north).

I do understand the costs of legal fees if it got tied up in probate would eat any gains from the smaller interest rate itself - presume, for a moment, that I'm willing to discount this concern.",finance

CryptoCurrency,Story of how I stopped doubting the importance of decentralization,"When I first heard about Bitcoin it was 2010. It was one geek project among others. You can imagine the type of people involved. I think most enthusiasts were either libertarians or just interested in crypto technology, or both.

As a very pragmatic person myself, it was easy to ignore the fuss about decentralization as idealist cry for more freedom, without much practical implications. I thought: as a citizen in a developed country, everything is working just fine with the existing central systems.

Then, the past 10 years I've been following the news and gradually seeing more and more problems all around me. It wasn't just theoretical, it wasn't just idealistic fuss.

First, let's remember the 2008 crisis that I eventually studied more. Big banks took massive risks and were bailed out with US taxpayers money. Private profit, public risk.

The Federal Reserve and ECB do whatever they want to manipulate the value of your money, and interest rates. Imagine you take a big mortgage with a low interest rate. You don't understand economics. Then, a house of cards built by the central banks, governments and banks collapses and the interest rate on your mortgage jumps to 15%. This was the reality in my country just 25 years ago. 15% of 100k is paying 15000k just for the interest. Every year. WTF?

Then I read a book about Deutsche Bank 2 years ago. It's called Dark towers (3.5/5, would recommend). It involves more stories about market manipulation including how Libor rates were manipulated, and the same continues today.

My own bank stopped offering currency exchange at a reasonable 2.5% fee, and guided me to Forex instead. Then, I watched Forex increase their prices every year. 8% spread in currency exchange. Fuck you!

Recently I rewatched The Big Short. I didn't even remember, but rating agencies, S&amp;P are corrupt as well.

I followed news about stock markets. The SEC gives absolutely ridiculously LOW fines for blatant crimes. The fines typically don't even cover profits made by the criminals. They hardly even make a dent to QUARTERLY profits.

Then I read about clearing houses, fail to delivers, and the ancient systems they use.

I learned about counterfeit stocks. Apparently stocks don't have unique IDs so there can be 2x more stocks in existence. Voting counts are ""adjusted"" to hide this embarrassing detail. Oh and you don't own any stocks. 

Oh and lastly, you don't own the money on your bank account. You have lent it to the bank and they legally own it. And they can profit of it, leverage it 10x to investments and loans using the fractional reserve system, and you get ABSOLUTELY ZERO SHARE OF THEIR MASSIVE PROFITS.

Over the course of the years, it should be obvious to anyone that central parties are not to be trusted with too much power.",cryptocurrency

Nervos is a UTXO proof-of-work blockchain which is building a cross-chain bridge with Cardano so that you can use your ADA on Nervos dApps and vice versa. Interoperability is a big theme for Nervos and they plan to have a working testnet within a month. Orion Protocol is building a terminal that will allow for decentralized non-custodial trading across centralized and decentralized exchanges. They say this would not require you to KYC or even have an account with any of these exchanges. Revuto is an online subscription management service that recently completed a $10MM token sale on Cardano.

The people from Wolfram were talking about very interesting things including live minting during streaming events and automated upload to IPFS. COTI will be building out auction and bidding mechanisms in ADAPay.
24. Professor Aggelos Kiayias gave us an update on research including that Ouroboros Chronos and Hydra papers have both been accepted into conferences/journals. Chronos will provide Cardano with a global concept of time that doesn’t rely on any outside timekeeper. Prof. Kiayias also pointed out that Hydra is distinguishable from other layer two protocols in that the scripting language is identical to that of the base layer in Cardano such that any dApp that can run on Cardano will run on the Hydra L2. This is a huge plus and superior to many other layer two solutions in other ecosystems where the base layer dApps will not run on layer two. Finally, the Mithril paper has been submitted for peer review. It will provide Cardano light wallets with Succinct Non-interactive Arguments of Knowledge that will give us the best of both worlds: no delays for syncing as in full node wallets while still preserving trustlessness.

This is another problem that could not happen in Cardano staking. It feels like we stepped into the ring, they rang the bell, and ETH just started punching itself in the head. Eventually it’s going to KO itself.

29. John O’Connor of IOHK points out that France still controls the monetary policy of 14 countries in Africa. There is definitely a built in market on the continent for a project that delivers monetary sovereignty to the people.

42. Robert Kornacki of dcSpark releases an article on why every Cardano dApp will use NFTs. The article contains some very interesting discussion on smart contracts in the EUTXO context including language instructing that “UTXOs have smart contracts attached to them and not the other way around” and “\[...\]the simplest way to think about it is that when a UTXO is created it has the option to have a smart contract attached to it.” [https://medium.com/dcspark/every-eutxo-dapp-will-use-nfts-and-heres-why-fd87e6a8c9a6](https://medium.com/dcspark/every-eutxo-dapp-will-use-nfts-and-heres-why-fd87e6a8c9a6)

61. Very interesting timing with a) Grayscale Buying $50MM ETCG, b) Grayscale adding ADA, and c) Charles joining the ETC Cooperative board given that two of the members of the ETC Cooperative board seem to come from Grayscale and DCG.

63. There is currently a lawsuit challenging the notion that staking rewards should be taxed as income. The plaintiff argues that newly created property isn’t taxed as income and that this should also apply to staking rewards. A win here would be very nice for Cardano delegators.

69. In news that could have significant repercussions for many stablecoin reliant Cardano DeFi projects, Fed Chair Jerome Powell gave some hard signals that they will regulate stablecoins in House Committee testimony. He revealed that the Fed will issue its long-awated paper on stablecoins, CBDCs, and other digital assets in September. Powell also went as far as to say ""You wouldn't need stable coins you wouldn't need cryptocurrencies if you had a digital US currency, I think that's one of the stronger arguments in its favor.""

85. The El Faro article reporting meetings between Cardano, Whizgrid of Cyprus, and the brothers of President Bukele of El Salvador definitely contain some extremely interesting details related to a possible Salvadorean national stablecoin by the end of the year and a possible digitization and blockchain storage of a wide range of government related documents next year. This could be huge!!!!!!

87. Sebastien of dcSpark was recently on Cardano Live to discuss Alonzo. [https://youtu.be/lejoT\_odbOY](https://youtu.be/lejoT_odbOY)
88. Notable news for upcoming Cardano DeFi projects. There may be slightly less competition in the “get a return on your crypto assets” game very soon. The New Jersey AG’s office has delivered a cease and desist letter to BlockFi. The AG’s press release cited BlockFi’s interest bearing deposit accounts as unregistered securities and also mentioned the lack of FDIC or SPIC insurance for it’s depositors. This leaves some lingering questions for Cardano DeFi projects that might be planning to accept deposits or other transfers of value and offering a return of sorts. You could argue that these projects are decentralized where BlockFi was not. But, the AG’s press release seems to cite decentralization as one of the risks of DeFi projects. Also, as a practical matter, there is a question whether decentralization will be a good shield from regulators since many of these projects have companies and real humans with faces and names behind them unlike a truly anonymous founder such as Satoshi Nakamoto. [https://www.njoag.gov/new-jersey-bureau-of-securities-orders-cryptocurrency-company-blockfi-to-stop-offering-interest-bearing-accounts/](https://www.njoag.gov/new-jersey-bureau-of-securities-orders-cryptocurrency-company-blockfi-to-stop-offering-interest-bearing-accounts/) [https://twitter.com/BlockFiZac/status/1417316834244796416](https://twitter.com/BlockFiZac/status/1417316834244796416)
89. EU is planning to introduce regulations on anonymous crypto wallets. This is a big deal. But, Cardano is probably more prepared than any with its identity solutions that could be used for KYC/AML. [https://twitter.com/Wiiinnie/status/1417575921565978628](https://twitter.com/Wiiinnie/status/1417575921565978628)
90. Cardano didn’t come up in the Cathie Wood, Jack Dorsey, and Elon Musk panel discussion at “The B Word” event. But, given how Elon repeatedly shot down maximalist explanations for the shortcomings of proof-of-work chains in energy consumption and throughput, the whole thing ended up sounding like a long-form pitch for proof-of-stake and Cardano. Seriously, you should check it out. [https://www.thebword.org/c/track-2-Bitcoin-As-A-Tool-For-Economic-Empowerment](https://www.thebword.org/c/track-2-Bitcoin-As-A-Tool-For-Economic-Empowerment)

92. Gary Gensler, SEC Chair, indicates that crypto assets providing synthetic exposure to securities will be regulated as securities.

100. Big lesson for future Cardano DeFi projects: Uniswap Labs just had to censor the Uniswap UI to ban synthetics of underlying securities.

CryptoCurrency,"In the interests of informed investment I think it's very important to challenge the assumption that ongoing inflation of the USD is a certainty in the mid term, it's very possible that despite increases in the cash supply we could see recession/depression, which are deflationary events","Arguably the most common narrative on the sub revolves around inflation, and while it's correct to say that long term inflation is a certainty, in the medium term we could actually be looking at a series of marginally, or deeply deflationary events - despite the increase in the money supply. This would lead to an increase in the value of the US dollar against BTC in the medium term.

If we look to Japan as an example, money printing isn't always inflationary. Because the financial system is botched, banks determine when and if they lend, and what interest rates they pass on. Since lending in our system is the primary driver of growth (and thus inflation), when the banks are conservative regarding lending, this results in less economic stimulation. This can occur regardless of the money pumped in to the system, since it sits in reserves. During financial uncertainty people are also less inclined to borrow generally speaking, the more scared they are, the more they horde fiat, which becomes a feedback loop. 

Secondary waves of COVID due to the delta strain, combined with the potential need for austerity measures in many parts of the world, could certainly lead to a massive reduction in production.

This has lead to a great deal of economic uncertainty, particularly in the major financial systems, and some of this is what has lead to the crab movement we've witnessed over the past quarter. Many people believe that when the stimulus halts the house of cards may fall down, and the largest players in the system are actually hedging with increased bonds purchases (a sign of fears of deflation from smart money). The markets usually shift before the economy, and the trend line in bond purchases is growing noticably.

So please, when choosing to invest, don't do so under the guaranteed assumption that inflation is a constant process - there can be breaks, both major and minor, and if there is a global economic crash we are likely to witness heavy deflation, which would in turn depress the price of bitcoin relative to the dollar (since the largest currency of exchange and trade are USD tethers, and since people tend to horde fiat during recessions/depressions).",cryptocurrency

We don't really have any other major debt aside from the mortgage, and we max out our retirement plans, put a decent amount away for college/future education for our two young children (aged 4yrs and 10months). We have an emergency fund that could always be a little bigger but it's there (about 30K). 

We've been saving and investing towards our goal of this house for so long we sort of need to re-evaluate what our investing goals are now that we achieved our big one of the forever home. We want to invest in future family vacations. 

In about 10 years from now I will have a 14 &amp; 10 year old and I want to be able to take my family on nice yearly vacations  and I would love it if those vacations were at least partially paid for by the interest of an investment now. Not that we won't travel before then, just want to do some real traveling when they're old enough to handle it.

* Measures to step up tax enforcement around crypto assets were added to the infrastructure bill at the last minute to raise funds to finance the infrastructure plan.
* The $550 billion will be spent over the next eight years on roads, bridges, high-speed internet, public transport, electric vehicles, airports, and shipping ports, among other areas.
* The measures impose heightened reporting requirements on crypto brokerages and exchanges. They will be required to provide details on cryptocurrency transactions of $10,000 or more to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).
* The provisions are expected to raise an additional $28 billion from cryptocurrency transactions.

CryptoCurrency,"Farming, Yields and ""Deflationary"" should be big red flags for you.","About 70% of the earth's surface is made up of water. In the same spirit, well over 70% of the crypto-space is made up of shitcoins (probably closer to 99%). That's great, but what makes a shitcoin, how do they tend to work, and what are some common red flags to look out for? 

*Disclaimer: For the sake of objectivity, I will consider the terms shitcoins and scamcoins interchangeable. Some people consider VET a shitcoin, others don't. Those are not the coins/tokens I'm talking about here.* 

[Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shitcoin.asp) defines a shitcoin as ""a cryptocurrency with little to no value or a digital currency that has no immediate, discernible purpose"".

[Urban Dictionary](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Shitcoin) defines a shitcoin as ""a great way to lose your money"". 

And they are both correct. A shitcoin is just that - shit. 

Now great! You figured out how to use PancakeSwap and now you're ready to 100x your hard earned money overnight! Your friend Bob invited you over to some fancy private Telegram groups, and you're confronted with hundreds of new, promising investing opportunities. Daily! Dev's are based, liquidity is locked, ownership is renounced. *What can go wrong?!* 

**""Farming"" and ""Deflationary Tokens"" are good indicators that the cryptocurrency you are buying is a scamcoin built to make developers (or at best, early adopters) lots of coin -- and to be promptly dumped on unsuspecting investors (that means you).** 

Some examples: BabySafeDoge, ElonMarsShiba, DarkShiba, and any other wild combination of food/animal/planet/etc related words. 

Honestly, names like these should already be a ginormous red flag.... *But let's proceed.*  

There are heaps of examples of projects like these, and they all rely on the same model: 

&amp;#x200B;

**1. The developer creates a smart contract which either:**

A) Burns 2-10% per transaction.

B) Steals 2-10% per transaction and gives it to ""stakers"".

C) Allows you to lock (stake) your newly purchased token to farm more of the token, or another shitty token.

*Fun fact: there are many generators for these smart contracts avaliable on the internet for as little as $100.*

**2. The developer puts the all the tokens and 1BNB in Pancakeswap or Uniswap, and burns the Liquidity Provider tokens. This is done to convince users that they cannot be ""Rugged"" by a developer removing the BNB from Pancakeswap -- rendering the tokens worthless.**

**3. The developer announces the release of his token. Not before putting in a big buy order on Pancakeswap, gobbling up a large chunk of the supply and promptly dumping it on everyone who purchases after him -- who ignorantly think that because the LP token was burned, they can't get ""rugged"".**

&amp;#x200B;

So - if the coin you're thinking of ""investing"" in, fits this criteria, it's probably a pump and dump shitcoin.

[**https://tokensniffer.com/tokens/scam**](https://tokensniffer.com/tokens/scam) **maintains a list of known rugs and scams.** However, once it's on this list -- it's probably too late. 

Nobody in a year (shit, even a week for most of them) is going to remember yet another ""deflationary"" coin that has 0 usecase. Goodboi will not be the next Dogecoin, and SafeElonBitcoin will not be the next Bitcoin. 

**Anyone shilling these coins has big bags and is just trying to dump them on you**, and is complicit in perpetuating the scam. If something seems too good to be true - 99% of times, it is. 

That is all.

CryptoCurrency,"CeFi, good or bad?","Here's some questions that I had before I decided to dive into CeFi. I'll post my answers to them, but what do you think?

1 - What do you think in general about CeFi projects like BlockFi, Celsius, Gemini, Nexo, etc?

I personally love the idea of earning interest on coins you can't stake. I also love the idea that by converting my crappy savings account into stablecoin, I'm now earning 7.5% on it instead of the bank's ""High Interest"" of 0.5%. But there's legit FUD to consider...

2 - Are they legit? 

Super high interest rates always sound scammy, but let's look at BlockFi for an example: they're trying to go public (you have to be accountable to investors) and they already partner with VISA. I don't think VISA would sully their name with a scam. So to me, this proves legitimacy as much as any other fiat company. History, length of operation, and country of origin all factor in as well.

3 - ""Not your keys not your coins""

Is the bank any different? Not your paper not your fiat. Gemini offers insurance on crypto to an extent and I'm sure others will follow. But yeah, if there's a rug-pull, you'll lose all your money, no getting around that. For this reason, I've got assets split between 2 companies, each with a different stablecoin. If one does get pulled I won't lose everything.

4 - Which companies are great, which ones suck? 

Nexo and crypto .com both scare me, I don't know much about the countries they're based in and the regulations there. BlockFi went down a notch for me because of the securities cases popping up, but I still think they're strong. Gemini is US based and GUSD seems transparent and safe. Celsius I'm 50-50 on, but am leaning more towards favorable every passing day. They do a lot of AMA and seem to be actively developing and working towards legit business. If Coinbase offers 4% that seems super safe to me, albeit a lower interest rate than others (but still like 10 times higher than most banks).

5 - Are your assets safe? 

Your hardware wallet ain't safe from fire or physical theft. Also, your metamask/trustwallet is probably a lot more susceptible to a hack than a centralized exchange. Insurance is also a big factor here and it seems like we're not far away from this being common in the crypto world.

6 - Which stablecoin is best?

Well I certainly won't say Tether, though that's always the best interest rate. I've seen FUD for pretty much every coin, but I honestly like GUSD and USDC the best because they seem transparent in general and are backed by Gemini and Coinbase which I think are both strong and not going anywhere.

personalfinance,Auto Loan Payoff?,"Quick question - is it advisable to pay off my auto loan in full? Here is my situation:

\- 27F, living in the suburbs with my parents of a HCOL area. Salary is 60k.  
\- Took out auto loan in 2019, financing the car with a 1.99% interest rate for 5 years. Have been paying off a bit over the minimum payment each month. I still owe a little under $14k.  
\- Don't have many expenses/bills at the moment besides the car loan. The monthly payment of my car takes up about 12% of my take-home pay. Fixed expenses include auto insurance, contributing a bit to my parents' rent, and credit card usage.  
\- Credit score is 805: I have 3 credit cards, have paid off my bachelors/masters academic loans in full, have purchased a car before to which I refinanced it after 2 years and then ultimately traded it in for my current car (new at the time). Current credit card consistently remains under 5% at any given point (currently at 2% - I always pay off the balance in full).  
\- Total bank accounts' balance amount to $37k, and I have a retirement account with a balance of $19k.

I am looking to move out within the next few months due to conditions that have come up with my parents (to sum it up - it's not just out my own complete desire, but it's also due to a need in maintaining my parents' housing resources; if I stay, they lose a benefit). But, due to the HCOL in my area, it's doable but it is costly and it would definitely impact how much I can save each month. 

I am considering to pay back the total balance of my auto loan, in order to have more monthly funds to be able to live on my own. Plus, I am able to pay it off while still having an emergency fund. But, I am worried about some repercussions of doing so. I've read that my credit score will drop temporarily - would this profoundly impact my ability to even apply for credit. Are there any other implications that I am not aware of or should be considering? Still learning how to more effectively manage my finances...

personalfinance,Rent vs own vs parents basement?,"This is going to be long. I figured more details would be helpful in assisting in a strangers plight.

Some background:

* 22 y/o new graduate nurse who just got a job working in an ER located in Chicago. 
   * three 12 hr shifts/week at $31/hr, $33.60/hr weekends, mandatory 2 weekends/mo. Overtime eligible, and since we're so short staffed, it should be no problem working two extra days a month to bump me up to a &gt;80 hr/biweekly pay period.
   * Full health/vision/dental, matches 3% of whatever I put into my Roth IRA. 
   * Low end gross: 53k/year. Most likely 60k/year gross. 
* Live with my parents in Chicago burbs. 
* No debt
   * full ride and worked throughout college, was too afraid to get a credit card.
   * Monthly recurring expenses: $340/mo.
      * Phone: $50/mo
      * Dog school/food: $150/mo
      * Gas: $90/mo
      * Streaming services: \~$50
* About 2k in savings. 
* No credit 
   * Now that I have a consistent source of income, I'm looking for ways to build up my credit in 1-2 years. 
* No SO/Kids, just a dog who I love dearly. 

I would like to spend 6mo minimum or 2 years maximum living at home just to get stabilized (build up savings, credit, etc) before considering renting/buying. 

**Questions:**

1. **Tips on building up credit?** Apply for a chain credit card and go from there? Whatever bank cards I qualify for? Does the amount I spend affect the rate in which the score increases/decreases, or is it just based on the fact that I consistently pay off the debt on time?
2. **Are condos a smart choice?** Ideally sell for what I bought it for, and the only ""loss"" would be HOA and taxes?  I like stability, and being priced out of my apartment doesn't appeal to me
3. **Is renting better for someone my age?** I'm young, there's ample opportunity for pay raise and job growth, and there are more options for rentals than condos in neighborhoods I'm interested in. Plus it will give me the opportunity to learn how to live on my own without a mortgage. 
4. **How big of a nest egg/good of a credit score should I aim for before considering apartment/condo hunting?** 

I don't know much about personal finance, but I've been lurking around to help prepare me for the transition to existing on my own. I appreciate any references/podcasts/books/media that would help educate me further.

personalfinance,Reducing Auto Loan Interest Rate by Buying from SO,"SO currently owes $8000 on a 2011 vehicle and has a horrendous 22.99% APR for the next fifty something months. She has terrible credit and won't have an income for the next three years, but still needs to have a vehicle. I was thinking of ways to reduce our spending. What are our options for reducing how much we are paying for financing?

I was considering taking out a personal loan with a much lower interest rate to buy the car from her to avoid wasting thousands on interest and thousands more for full coverage auto insurance. What kind of interest rates can I expect for a personal loan?

personalfinance,"Just graduated University with a new job, Roth 401k or pay off loans?","So I recently graduated from college and started a job in my field. A part of graduation is to start paying of my loans. I'll throw some numbers out there from my budget to help you understand.

I make about $62k pre-tax or $30/hour 40 hours a week, which is about $4800 per month. 

Then I pay for insurances (Medical, Dental, Vehicle, and Renters) that comes to about $485/ month. I also pay rent ($650/month), Truck loan ($538/month), Utilities ($210), and around $120 for fuel for my vehicle. Those are my non-negotiable payments. I also expect my student loans to be around $330/month, Dog food &amp; supplies ($120), Spotify ($12), and food ($300/month). All those add up to around $2800/month.

That leaves about $800/ month left. I would only use a max of $750 to pay off loans or invest in the 401k.

The student loan is about $32k and has no interest until Sep. 2021, I am not sure on length or interest rate as the company doesn't really know right now. I used the 2019 rate and length to find $330/ month at 10 years and 4.58%. The vehicle is $33k on a 6 year loan that I just started. 

So what I am wondering is if I should start to put some money into my Roth 401k or use that extra money to pay off my student or vehicle loan off. Should I split that money between my 401k and paying off my higher interest loan or should I focus on 1 or the other? 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: I have $750/ month to put towards paying my loans off, investing into my 401k, or a split between them.",finance

Bitcoin,Further Elaboration on the Infrastructure Bill Concerning Miner KYC,"I want to further elaborate on this. It is important for people to understand the legal precedent that was used to take down both Helix and Bitmex, because it has everything to do with this bill. They charged bitmex with banking secrecy act violations and tax evasion aid because they had enough proof that bitmex did commerce with us citizens. This Bill isn't just a way to enforce this on US entities. We know the US will use DeFi overseas, and the federal agencies know it also. The mere failure to collect KYC by offshore entitites is in and of itself a breach of US law on the banking secrecy act. This law helps set the precedent domestically in clear language so that they have a basis to extrajudicially and extrajurisdictionally sieze, litigate, threaten, enforce, and prosecute anyone in the world in any country. That's why FTX and Binance instituted mandatory KYC yesterday. The purpose of this bill is to enforce global surveillance on all validators and miners in the world, not just the US. They will, and they intend to, and that's why they introduced the bill. They have been planning to litigate against Trezor and Ledger Nano for a long time. This Bill is to help them do it.

This is why they want Marathon to censor blocks. If you let them censor Ofac, soon they will start censor everything. This is setting up to be a hostile takeover of the industry by wallstreet types to try to fundamentally backdoor the protocols to censor at the node and miner level. They wouldn't do that if they didn't have a plan to collect KYC and a plan to make it only affordable for mega industry players to collect that KYC, putting the miners and validators and governance in the hands of these billionaire corporations in the states.",cryptocurrency
CryptoCurrency,So you're in it for the tech? Let's talk tech. A simple POW blockchain explanation with code PART 1,"It always amazes me how many people say they are in it for the tech (yes I know it's a meme), but they can't begin to explain the first thing about how a blockchain works. If that's you, let's change that! I am going to try to really ELI5 the concepts but reinforce them with some simple python code. Disclaimer: I'm not an expert and happy to have anyone correct me.

For this example, we'll be talking about proof of work (POW). This is just part 1. I don't want to overwhelm you, but if there is interest, I will make new posts until we've built out a full blockchain in python.

**What is a blockchain?**

It's nothing more than an immutable (not changeable) store of information (in blockchain, we call these blocks). What makes it special is that as there is new information to store, it gets saved on top of the existing data. Each new piece of information (block) stores a reference to the data below it. These references are in the form of hashes.

**What is a hash?**

The topic are hashes are really complex, but all you need to know about them is that they are a computer algorithm's that take data of an arbitrary size and converts it to a fixed size. If the input data is the same, the hash will be the same every time you generate it. If you only have the hash, you cannot reverse it to get back to the original data. You should also know that a tiny change to the input data, results in a completely different hash. It won't look similar at all.

**Let's try it out:**

This assumes you are using Python 3 and have a basic understanding of Python and the command line. If not, there are tons of resources online, but happy to try to answer any questions.

in this example, we are going to use the standard programming string ""hello world"" as our input data for simplicity. But in a real blockchain the input data is most likely a group of many transactions.

Open a terminal and enter the following. This opens a python interpreter in which you can run code.

     python3

Now enter each line 1 by 1, pressing enter between each line.

    import hashlib # imports the hashing library
    input_data = ""hello world"".encode('utf-8') # set some input data
    first_hash = hashlib.sha256(input_data).hexdigest() # saves the hash of our input data to a variable
    print(first_hash) # prints out the hash

Notice that after the entering the last line you get this out:

    b94d27b9934d3e08a52e52d7da7dabfac484efe37a5380ee9088f7ace2efcde9

Repeat the steps above and you'll see the hash doesn't change.

Now let's make one tiny change to our input data (making the word world plural) and prove that the hash stays the same length but completely changes. In the same terminal enter the following lines:

    input_data_updated = ""hello worlds"".encode('utf-8') # create some new input data
    second_hash = hashlib.sha256(input_data_updated).hexdigest()
    print(second_hash)

Notice this time you the following output:

    8067f1ae16f20dea0b65bfcbd50d59014d143c8ecebab179d923f6ef244b40f8

You should know that we can just treat the hash like any other text and hash it again. We can even combine it with other text before we hash it. Let's try it out:

    combined_hash = hashlib.sha256(str(first_hash).encode('utf-8') + str(second_hash).encode('utf-8')).hexdigest()
    print(combined_hash)

Now you will get the following:

    3ef229cf1df86a5a0a0fed22d95484585995bc9d851e4b46ac57b7287fa0f9ea

**How do hashes make a blockchain immutable?**

Because we now know the properties of hashes, we know that changing the input data changes our hash. We also know the each block refers to the block below it by referencing it's hash. The way it does this is by combining its own input data with the hash of the previous block, just as we did in the above example. In POW, nodes run special software the keep track of the existing blocks and validate new ones. Just like we did in the above example, they can calculate the hash for themselves. If things don't check out they will reject the block.

So imagine an attacker wants to change data in an older block so instead of saying you sent crypto to your friend, they try to rewrite history to say you sent crypto to them. But we know if they try to propose a block with this change, it will change the hash of the block they modified and thus will change the hash of every block after it.

The only way they could work around this is by performing a 51% attack. in POW, nodes follow the longest chain of valid blocks. But because the attacker has gone and changed an older block all the blocks after that one are invalid because the hashes are wrong. They would need to regenerate all the blocks after the one they modified to make them valid. But doing so is expensive because meanwhile, all other miners are generating real blocks. This is where 51% attack comes in. If the attacker controlled &gt; 50% of the hashing power (computer's generating blocks), their modified chain will eventually become longer than the real one and nodes will begin treating that as the real chain.

This scenario is difficult to do because gaining hashing power requires a lot of computer resources that are expensive. In the next part, we'll look at what these computers are doing that makes it a long and costly attack.",cryptocurrency

stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Friday, July 30, 2021","**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, July 30, 2021**

Stocks fell Friday, reversing after yesterday’s gains to cap off one of the choppier weeks we’ve had in the market all year. The choppiness largely seems to stem from very erratic movements after-hours after companies report earnings. In my humble opinion, a lot of these movements seem like overreactions to me and represent nice opportunities. Moreover, this week market participants digested a weaker-than-expected print in GDP growth and the Federal Reserve’s July Monetary Policy Report. 

Despite the volatility, all three major indexes closed the month higher, capping the six consecutive month of gains. As of today’s close, the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) is up 18.04% year-to-date. Absolutely insane. On the other hand, the Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, continued it’s streak of underperformance, closing the month 3.77% lower. 

Core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) grew at a faster year-on-year rate in June than in May, reflecting ongoing upward price pressures as demand surges during the recovery. The Bureau of Economic Analysis reported that core PCE grew 3.5% in June over last year, topping May's 3.4% rate. Still, however, this was less hot than the 3.7% pace consensus economists expected.

Yesterday, the US Bureau of Economic Analysis released its advanced estimate of second-quarter gross-domestic-product (GDP) growth. Despite accelerating from the first-quarter, economists were largely expecting a higher jump, despite consumer spending, the largest component of US economic activity, beating expectations. However, it seems market participants were not fazed. Here are the numbers:

* **Q2 GDP, seasonally adjusted annualized quarter-over-quarter:** 6.5% vs. 8.4% expected and a downwardly revised 6.3% in Q1
* **Personal consumption:** 11.8% vs. 10.5% expected and 11.4% in Q1
* **Core personal consumption expenditures, quarter-over-quarter:** 6.0% vs. 6.1% expected and an upwardly revised 2.7% in Q1

The July Monetary Policy Report was largely reiterated the same thing it has been for the last 3-4 months, but did include did include some new language hinting that the economic recovery is getting closer to the Fed’s stated goals. The statement read, “Last December, the Committee indicated that it would continue to increase its holdings of Treasury securities by at least $80 billion per month and of agency mortgage‑backed securities by at least $40 billion per month until substantial further progress has been made toward its maximum employment and price stability goals. Since then, the economy has made progress toward these goals, and the Committee will continue to assess progress in coming meetings.”

Moreover, the Fed athe report did acknowledge potential risks and stated the Fed was ready to act if “appropriate risks arise”. The statement read, “In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals. The Committee's assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on public health, labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.”

* 18.15% APR

My credit score is 720 (Experian). 

I have already stopped using both my cards. During the course of the pandemic and the reduction of income, I felt like I lost control. So that's an important thing to do #1. 

\#2 is that I already tried calling Discover and Wells Fargo to see if they could lower my interest rates or do anything for me and they said no. 

\#3 is that I'm doing the ""snowball method"" for paying down debt in about 80/20 since Discover has a higher minimum payment. Wells Fargo just honestly feels more manageable and I don't like that card as much (though I'll keep it open).

I want to get my overall utilization down to \~30% before I would do anything mentioned in the post title. Does that make sense? Or should I \[transfer, loan\] sooner?",finance

personalfinance,Severely Underinsured after Major House Fire,"Hello personal finance folks! 

My in-laws recently experienced a devastating house fire. Everyone is okay, but they were severely underinsured after some major renovations over the past couple of years. (My father-in-law had intended to adjust their policy this month, but the fire hit before he could. Ugh!) 

They’re able to save some of the structure, and their contractor is waiving his supervising fees to keep the rebuild costs as low as possible, but they’re definitely going to have to get a sizable construction loan. We’re thinking out of pocket costs will be at least $100k (especially with current costs for building supplies) but we don’t know exactly what they’d be looking for in a loan. 

Here are my questions:

1. Construction loans are not something my family has any experience with. Do you have any tips about application processes/questions to ask the bank?
2. We’ve set up a GoFundMe for them with a modest goal compared to their expected expenses, but it will still be a good chunk of change. My husband and I have a high yield savings account with Ally, and we have suggested they open one, too, to make a little extra money on the money while it sits. My mother-in-law, though, is pretty uncomfortable with the idea of an online-only bank. She’s suggested putting the money in a CD, but we’ve cautioned her against tying it up unnecessarily. Do you have any suggestions of brick-and-mortar banks that have high interest rates? For reference, they are in the mid-Atlantic USA area. (Sorry to not be more specific—but the same anxiety about online banks has caused her to be cautious about sharing any semi-exact location online.)
3. And finally: I hope that none of you have had a similar experience, but if you have, do you have any tips or organizations to get in contact with? We already have the Lions Club and Red Cross on our radar.

Thanks a bunch! This is my first post on this sub, so if there’s a better sub to direct these questions to please let me know. :)",finance
stocks,Why stocks drop after earnings,"I feel like this earnings season is a great time to compile a list of reasons why a stock can drop after an earnings report and also how you can use this knowledge to decide for yourself if the dip is a good buying opportunity or if it's time to jump ship. I'll start us off, but comment below if I missed anything!

&amp;#x200B;

**1.**  **Financials Missed Estimates**

This is what most people look for in the earnings report first, and what headlines news articles. Did revenue grow, did EPS beat, etc. However, in this day and age, I'd argue this does not matter as much compared to some of the other metrics below, especially for growth stocks. Sure, a big miss will result in the stock tanking, but a slight miss, meeting expectations, or slight beat will not really move the stock all by itself. Sometimes, even a big beat in financials won't necessarily outweigh the impact of the other metrics.

* Before making a decision to buy/sell, ask yourself: ""Do the financials of this quarter change my overall thesis in any way?"" ""Is the miss in financials something temporary (i.e maybe acquisition costs) or is there a worrying trend?"" ""Is the miss in financials something that is out of the company's control (i.e pandemics, natural disasters, etc.)?""

&amp;#x200B;

**2. A Miss Elsewhere**

This includes anything outside of pure financials and sometimes outweighs the impact of the company's balance sheet. For example, social media companies rely heavily on growth of MAUs in line or above expectations. Production can be slowed due to shortages or other reasons, which investors see as threatening to the profitability of the company in the near/long term.

* Before making a decision to buy/sell, ask yourself: ""Is this something that's temporary or that will continue to be a problem?"" ""Does this change my overall thesis in any way?""

&amp;#x200B;

**3. Earnings are Priced In**

Say it with me everyone: ""everything is priced in."" On a more serious note, right now a lot of companies are priced for perfection, so even a nice beat on every metric may not move the price that much, because it's expected to do so. However, a miss on anything can result in investors selling out of a rich valuation to take profits and waiting for a more reasonable entry. It's a nice reminder that fundamental analysis does matter even in an extreme bull market.

* Before making a decision to buy/sell, ask yourself: ""Is my future valuation of this company still the same?"" ""If not, is it still reasonable enough to justify holding/buying more?"" ""Is the new price attractive enough for me to buy?"" ""How long do I plan to hold this stock for, and is there a better opportunity to grow my money elsewhere?""

&amp;#x200B;

**3. Sector Influences &amp; Competition**

This includes more macro movements of the stock market. Is it in a cyclical industry? Is there positive momentum for the stock? Other similar company earnings can impact the way investors feel about the stock before its earnings. This can lead to overly high expectations, and result in overall disappointment if the company does not report as well as its competitors. Significant events can also play a role in the overall sentiment of the earnings report. For example, eBay moving away from PayPal transactions greatly hurt investor sentiment for the future financials of the company.

* Before making a decision to buy/sell, ask yourself: ""Did the company's competitive advantage weaken?"" ""Will the events that transpired hurt the company in the long term?""

&amp;#x200B;

**4. Poor Guidance**

This is probably the most important factor. The stock market is priced for the future. If the company can't provide guidance of continued growth in metrics that are most important to their success, or if their predicted growth is too slow for the consensus of analysts and investors - this will greatly tank the stock price. This ties into point 3, where the sentiments of overall valuation change. Sometimes, CEOs have a history of sandbagging their guidance; it would be wise to keep this in consideration when judging the outcome of earnings.

* Before making a decision to buy/sell, ask yourself: ""Is the guidance reasonable? Is leadership sandbagging or is the guidance too optimistic?"" ""Does the guidance change my overall thesis, are people overreacting?""

&amp;#x200B;

**5. Changes in Philosophy and Leadership**

When leadership changes, the transition can be rocky for the short term, or it can drastically change the mission of the company. This can also mean poor allocation of capital, poor guidance, etc.

* Before making a decision to buy/sell, ask yourself: ""Will the new leadership change anything?"" ""Is this change temporary?"" ""Is this change something that I think will help or hurt the company?""

&amp;#x200B;

**6. Market Headlines and Trends**

This would be anything related to broad market changes, like interest rates, a market shift to lower-risk investments, world news, etc.

* Before making a decision to buy/sell, ask yourself: ""Does this hurt the company in the long term?""

&amp;#x200B;

Earnings are a fun time, but they may also be scary for investors. It's important to remember to not trade based on emotions. A 10-20% drop can be scary - but make sure to dig into why the stock price changed and if that changes the reasons why you initially invested in the company.",finance
personalfinance,Working Two Jobs to Pay Student Debt?,"Hi guys,

I am a college rising senior that will have around 100k (1/3 private) in debt ( I know horrible but long story short i was sabotaged by my family and a scholarship (funding issues on them) ). I will be graduating with a degree in Aero/Astro Engineering. 

I have 3 offers ranging from 73k-90k. Bad thing is all of them are in HCOL areas.

The 73k offer is a federal job that has a stipulation that will pay 10k of my loans every year (favoring that)

Beyond my degree in engineering, I have certifications in AWS Cloud Practitioner and SysOps and I have extensive experience tutoring students in Math all the way upto differential equations. I can also teach 1st year comp sci concepts

I was wondering what avenues I should take to reduce my loans. Im willing to work like no tomorrow just so I can get rid of my loans.

No CC loans, 750 credit score, no other financial obligation
(PS. I am an immigrant and my family is putting a lot of pressure on me to buy a house. I really dont want to do it in this market. Especially with my debt)

Thanks guys, you are all awesome.

CryptoCurrency,A coming market correction and its possible effects on crypto.,"Today and tomorrow are Congresses last days to extend both the debt ceiling and the moratorium on evictions and suspension of mortgages. Die to many reasons but seemingly down to Apathy they put this off to the last minute. Last month the Supreme Court allowed one final extension of the moratorium after ruling that the CDC did not and never had the power to pass such a moratorium. They specifically said Congress would have to legislate such an extension just yesterday POTUS finally said something and urged congress to act with only two days to spare. 

The government highly likely will not be able to pass the eviction relief bill in the day and a half they have remaining until recess (vacation) On top of that the debt ceiling may not be raised due to the aforementioned time constraints and recess. While in normal circumstances a government shut down would not be too much of a problem for the wider economy, in this situation with the market itself basically just held up by money printing, it will be the straw that breaks the camels back. The FED is a private organization you might say they can operate on their own. And you would be correct even, except to print money they need treasuries (securities) to back the cash. These neat little collateral units are the backbone of most of the economy you never see. And in a normal economy a shut down would just make them start eating into stored securities. They have enough for years even. This economy is not normal. 

Too many Entities are competing for treasuries in the market as cash is not and cannot be collateral. This is shown by the ever increasing Reverse Repo which just passed 1 trillion dollars dollars just today. 1 Trillion parked overnight at the fed? Why? The reverse repo system primarily exists to service MMF's (market maker funds) These funds exist to invest in US debt to keep the currency solvent. Fidelities mmf's alone make up a significant chunk of daily RRP in recent days and months. Why? The FED is the market of last resort and they have their own treasury supply to act as collateral. MMF's NEED treasuries to remain functional and for the US currency to remain solvent. There are supposed to be securities in the wider market and they have never needed to dip into the fed at this level before. So what changed? A combination of factors seperate from Covid and stimulus but starting with kicking the can down the road in 2008. The entire market outside of the stock market is completely over leveraged. 

So who else is competing for those treasuries? Banks, Hedgefunds, Bullion banks, Businesses, Bonds, You name it. Competition is so fierce right now that MMF's simply cannot compete so they flee to the FED. But it is not so simple. With a possible government shutdown no more treasuries can be made. The FED is starting to Run low on stored securities no matter how many times they raise the borrow limit, right now 80 billion per registrant. It is predicted that at 1.3 trillion they will no longer be able to satisfy all treasury demand and problems will start occuring. 
How would this cause a market crash and why should I as a crypto currency investor care? Without treasuries these overleveraged entities will crash and burn and start a margin chain reaction that will tank the whole market. On the other side if MMF's cannot secure treasuries the entire currency is in jeopardy. 
The effect on crypto in my opinion will be massive fear induced fomo from a market crashpushing prices up as desperate people look to recoup losses. In the short term I believe it will lead to a large dip as people liquidate to pay bills and expenses. So on that note continue to Buy and HODL but don't yolo and stay safe out there.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Remove PMI as prices in the neighborhood have increased.,"Hello

When I bought my house it was appraised at $475k.

House Price : $520k

Appraised Price : $475k

Current House prices for similar house in the neighborhood : $690k

Outstanding loan balance $442k

I asked my mortgage company to do a re-appraisal and I got this response. Need help understanding what this means.

Can someone suggest me if my understanding of doing re-appraisal at this point in time correct?

&gt;An appraisal can be ordered, via our offices, at the expense of the homeowner, when a loan has been seasoned for two years starting with the 1st payment date. If an appraisal is requested and the borrower is eligible, then a LTV of 75.0% is required if the loan is less than 5 years seasoned and 80.0% for loans more than 5 years seasoned. If an appraisal is desired prior to the two year requirement, evidence (receipts, work orders) of completed substantial structural improvements must be submitted to our PMI department. These improvements would then be reviewed by our PMI removal analysts to determine if an early appraisal can be granted. As specified in #1, a Good Payment History must be maintained.

EDIT : Date bought : FEB2021.

CryptoCurrency,"After El Salvador warning, IMF says accepting Bitcoin as national currency is “a step too far” | The balls on these people....","https://cryptoslate.com/after-el-salvador-warning-imf-says-accepting-bitcoin-as-national-currency-is-a-step-too-far/

##

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) published a warning that putting Bitcoin (BTC) or any other crypto on par with a national currency presents serious risks to macro-financial stability.

In their official blog post, written by monetary and capital markets department director Tobias Adrian and legal department head Rhoda Weeks-Brown, the IMF describes adopting cryptos as national currencies as “a step too far” and “an inadvisable shortcut,” while recognizing the “advantages of their underlying technologies.” 

##

#####Breaking-down the crypto threat

Some of the most pressing threats of the widespread Bitcoin adoption outlined in the blog post include crypto’s money laundering, financing of terrorism and environmental implications.

“Without robust anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism measures, cryptoassets can be used to launder ill-gotten money, fund terrorism, and evade taxes,” the authors warned, adding that “this could pose risks to a country’s financial system, fiscal balance, and relationships with foreign countries and correspondent banks.”

The blog post also pointed out “an enormous amount of electricity” used for mining Bitcoin, saying that the ecological implications of adopting crypto as a national currency “could be dire” but failed to mention initiatives to take advantage of renewable energy. 

Besides these abstract global threats, the authors detoured into an everyday life anxiety buildup, while addressing more individual-oriented compromises, such as sustainability of domestic prices.

“As a result, domestic prices could become highly unstable. Even if all prices were quoted in, say, Bitcoin, the prices of imported goods and services would still fluctuate massively, following the whims of market valuations.” 

In the same manner, the authors addressed how crypto might compromise consumer protection while saying that “households and businesses could lose wealth through large swings in value, fraud, or cyber-attacks.” 

##

#####Urging governments to step up

While the biggest part of the blog was dedicated to warnings about risks and pitfalls surrounding Bitcoin adoption, the concluding remarks were written in a consistent alarm-raising tone as the authors urged governments to react with a solution in the form of national digital currency (CBDC).

“Governments, however, need to step up to provide these services, and leverage new digital forms of money while preserving stability, efficiency, equality, and environmental sustainability,” concluded the authors worried about “monetary policy losing a bite.”",cryptocurrency
Bitcoin,Historic rally,"If we close a smidge over 40K today we will have 10 Green Days in a row. I think it was mentioned here that we’ve only had 9 in a row three times, each followed by a face melting rally. But we have never had 10 Green Days in a row. 

Imo it doesn’t make sense that the cycle top was 65K. We’re still in a risk on environment for (probably) the next year at least, and in such an environment Bitcoin should continue its rally, atleast until interest rates go back down.

Tbh though none of this means anything until we see Bitcoin go back above the 200W, followed by a golden cross. It also is kind of meaningless to follow prices closely if you’re not planning on trading but instead hodling with a specific price in mind. But it’s nice to have confirmation of your conviction after going against the herd over the past 3 months.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Tax question on long term and short term capital gains,"I just want to verify I’m thinking about this correctly in regards to how taxes are calculated when you have both long term and short term capital gains for a single filer. To make things easier, I live in a state with no state income tax and am strictly talking about Federal calculations.

Long term gains: $30,000

Short term gains from stocks: $7,000

Federal income Taxes owed:

CryptoCurrency,How do we not become the villains?,"Look, I love crypto.  I love this sub.  I think moons are great, Elon is a Douche Canoe, and SafeDogeElonMoonGateConnectFuckMountain BSC coins are all scams.  We’ve got some great people and we are all looking forward to seeing crypto succeed.  Most of us only sparsely care about the tech or don’t care about it all and want to make bank as early adopters, and yes, a few of us genuinely care about how crypto will fundamentally change the world.

#Butttt….

Can we really say we deserve to get rich off of crypto and ask for things like countries adopting bitcoin when 18% of the world doesn’t even have a cell phone or easy access to a computer?  Is it really right for us to tromp around like our shit doesn’t stink when we say “regulations are bad, muh decentralization!!!!1111 or “not your keys, not your coins, too bad you got scammed!”

I’m just saying, crypto is definitely still in its infancy, and while I don’t know that it will truly replace fiat (because governments can’t manipulate it and inflate away their debt with bitcoin.). 

I don’t know… I feel like the biggest piece of us all getting to lambo land is solving how to get crypto to as many people as possible, and eventually, everyone. And hey, I’m NOT the guy to do it.  I just like to post for moons and Hodl projects I believe in.  But calling for countries to adopt BTC as their currency…. I just don’t know.  Watching it lose half its buying power over a month has given me pause.  Not FUD, I just wonder…
Like, if a mother in El Salvador converts her dollars to BTC at the governments behest, and then it drops 40-70%, and she can’t feed her kids…

I’m just saying, I think maybe a crypto based on a basket of currencies and the value of gold and silver and oil or some such might be less volatile.  Thoughts?",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,401k rollover that has pre-tax and roth 401k money [JH -&gt; Fidelity],"Tried searching and couldn't find, most likely suck at searching.

I had an account at John Hancock from my previous employer that I am trying to rollover to my new employer's 401k plan at Fidelity that contained contributions to a regular 401k and to a roth 401k along with the employer match. I received the check and it is a single check which on the penultimate page just goes over the withdrawal details of funds/units/amounts and the last page goes over distribution amounts.

I have 2 questions: 

* In the table it displays as follows. (From [here](https://www.dwc401k.com/form-1099-r-distribution-codes) it shows that Code G = Direct rollover to another plan and GB combined = Direct rollover to another plan + Designated Roth.)
   * My issue is I never withdrew any money from the 401k so why would it show amount z?  


|Distribution Amount|Taxable Amount|Employee Contributions Withdrawn|Federal Tax|State Tax|Distribution Code|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|x = total - y|$0.00|$0.00|$0.00|$0.00|G|
|y|$0.00|z|$0.00|$0.00|GB|

* When I called Fidelity they said that they require 2 checks to process, the first being pre-tax and the second being roth. Since I can not call as they are closed for the weekend I am wondering what would be the process here as it seems John Hancock issues it all together in one check.
   * If I start the rollover process online it allows me to designate how much is roth and how much is pretax so I was curious if I did that then just submit the picture of the check via the app then would it just work itself out and the correct amounts go to correct buckets in new plan or do I need to figure out how to get two separate checks?",finance

Now here where i need your advice .  I have been thinking about this .. Instead of my original plan of paying down my mortage as soon as possible . If  only pay P&amp;I everymonth and put the extra in say I-treasury bonds ( 40k (?) max) , wont I be saving some money due to 1) tax saving on mortage interest  2) state  tax saving on treasury bond interest 3) federal tax saving if using the treasury bonds as a educational vehicle.

# **July jobs report could be what gives the market its next big jolt in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/30/july-jobs-report-could-be-what-gives-the-market-its-next-big-jolt-in-the-week-ahead.html)**
*****
&gt; Friday’s jobs report could be a catalyst that helps determine whether markets are volatile or will trade like it’s the quiet dog days of August.
*****
&gt; More than a quarter of the S&amp;P 500 report earnings in the coming week. The calendar includes companies in sectors such as consumer staples, insurance, pharma, travel and media. From Booking Holdings to ViacomCBS, Wayfair and Kellogg, investors will be watching to see what companies say about reopening activity, supply chain disruptions and rising costs.
*****
&gt; “I think as much as 85% of the companies which are reporting earnings mentioned inflation on their earnings calls,” Franklin Templeton Fixed Income chief investment officer Sonal Desai said. “Inflation may not be a problem to policymakers and financial markets, which seem not to be concerned at all. It does seem to bother the people who have to buy stuff or people who produce stuff.”
*****
&gt; # The jobs factor
&gt; The Federal Reserve has said the sharp jump in inflation is just temporary, and many investors appear to be taking it in stride for now. The market is intensely focused on the central bank’s other mandate: the labor market. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said Wednesday he would like to see strong jobs reports before winding down the central bank’s $120 billion a month bond-buying program.
*****
&gt; The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics will release the July employment report on the morning of Friday, Aug. 6. It’s expected to show 788,000 nonfarm payrolls, down from 850,000 in June, according to Dow Jones. The unemployment rate is expected to dip to 5.7% from 5.9%. Average hourly wages are expected to rise 3.9% year over year.
*****
&gt; Ironsides Macroeconomics director of research Barry Knapp said he expects the next two monthly jobs reports will be strong, and the Fed should then be ready to announce in September that it is ready to start the slow unwind of its bond purchasing program.
*****
&gt; That is an important step since it would be the first real move away from the central bank’s easy policies that were put in place in the pandemic. It would also mean the Fed would be open to raising interest rates once the tapering is completed.
*****
&gt; # Game changer for markets
&gt; “Friday could be a game changer,” Knapp said of the employment report. Before that, he expects stocks to trade in a narrow range.
*****
&gt; If the number of jobs added in July is much higher than expected, at more than 1 million, Knapp said the market could immediately sell off on the idea the Fed would be ready to pare back its bond purchases.
*****
&gt; If the number is weaker than expected, the market could rally. “We are in a dead period after earnings, with concerns about the pace of the reopening. It’s still a bit of a question mark. The bias would be higher after a weak number. ... Bad is good. Good is bad,” said Knapp.
*****
&gt; Like some other strategists, he expects to see a stock market correction, possibly later this summer.
*****
&gt; “I’m in the camp where I think we’re going to have our first major correction.” Knapp said. “What we’re likely to get is at least 10% or more. ... It could really happen when they [Fed officials] make the announcement in September.”
*****
&gt; Wilmington Trust chief economist Luke Tilley said he expects just 350,000 jobs, based on the high frequency data he watches.
*****
&gt; “We think the run rate is about 500,000 jobs. Last month seems a little bit overcooked,” he said.
*****
&gt; # Reflation trade
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 was down 0.4% in the past week, finishing at 4,395, while the Nasdaq lost even more , down 1.1% at 14,672.
*****
&gt; Cyclical stocks were among the best performers. Materials jumped 2.8% in the week, and energy shares were up 1.6%. Financials gained 0.7%. But tech fell 0.7%.
*****
&gt; Knapp said it now makes sense to hold stocks that are in the reflation trade, such as energy, industrials or materials.
*****
&gt; The surge in the delta variant of the coronavirus has become a worry among investors and has been a factor holding down interest rates. The 10-year yield, which moves opposite price, has held at low levels and was at 1.23% on Friday, amid concern that the delta variant of the coronavirus could slow growth.
*****
&gt; Investors will be watching other important data in the coming week, including the Institute for Supply Management’s manufacturing data Monday, and jobless claims and trade data Thursday.
*****
&gt; # The China trade
China was also a dominant market story in the past week and could continue to be. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index fell 5% for the week. Chinese regulators continued their crackdown on internet companies, publicly traded education companies and other industries.
*****
&gt; Strategists say Beijing is trying to reclaim its biggest companies as its own and turn them away from listings in foreign markets. Officials were particularly upset with Didi Global which reportedly went public even after being warned not to by Beijing.
*****
&gt; Chinese regulators reportedly spoke with international banks after their actions sparked a wave of selling in internet stocks and the broader Chinese stock market. The regulators said companies could continue to go public in the U.S. if they met listing requirements.
*****
&gt; “We will continue to see regulators try to calm the waters. I would say this was a communications misstep,” said Franklin Templeton’s Desai. “You don’t have massive swings without having negative impact.” She added it sent ripples through emerging markets.
*****
&gt; “This is China trying to gain control, and they tried to do it in a very heavy way, and they were surprised at the backlash,” Desai said.
*****
&gt; The KraneShares CSI China Internet ETF has lost about half its value from its peak in February, and was down another 2.6% Friday.
*****
&gt; Internet retailer Alibaba is one of the ETF’s top holdings. The company is expected to announce earnings on Tuesday.

&gt; # August has been a dangerous month for the market

&gt; August is the worst DJIA, S&amp;P 500, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 month over the last 33 years, 1988-2020 with average declines ranging from 0.4% by Russell 2000 to 0.8% by DJIA. For NASDAQ August ranks second worst over the same period with an average gain of 0.2%.

&gt; Contributing to this poor performance since 1987; the second shortest bear market in history (45 days) caused by turmoil in Russia, the Asian currency crisis and the Long-Term Capital Management hedge fund debacle ending August 31, 1998 with the DJIA shedding 6.4% that day. DJIA dropped a record 1344.22 points for the month, off 15.1%—which is the second worst monthly percentage DJIA loss since 1950. Saddam Hussein triggered a 10.0% slide in August 1990. Sizeable losses in 2010, 2011, 2013 and 2015 of over 4% on DJIA have widened Augusts’ average decline.

&gt; In post-election years, Augusts’ rankings are little changed. August is the worst month for DJIA and Russell 1000 and second worst for S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ and Russell 2000. Average declines in post-election year Augusts swell to 0.8% by Russell 2000 to 1.7% by DJIA. Each index has also seen more declining post-election year Augusts than positive.

&gt; # Modern 4-Year Cycle Theory Approaching Near Term High

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/e7c3175df9fa85b593af70440d79c62f/b5c96d0e540e1659-24/s500x750/5c976a9f3f233c0795ead0a363cd399469eab8e2.jpg))**

&gt; Despite the recent uptick in volatility and today’s drop the S&amp;P 500% is up 17.2% year-to-date. This is right in line with our 2021 Annual Forecast best case scenario made last December. Our updated outlook is for S&amp;P 500 to finish the year in the 4300-4500 range or even higher.

&gt; However, as you can see in the chart of the Modern 4-Year Presidential Election Cycle we are due for a pause over the next couple of months before the rally resumes in the September/October timeframe. This illustration of the average 4-year cycle uses the S&amp;P 500 back to 1949, which is the first full cycle post-WWII vs. other comparisons that use the Dow back 125 years to 1896.

&gt; We feel the more recent dataset is a better representation of the modern cycle where post-election years have been better and election years weaker – impacted by the undecided election in 2000 and the financial crisis of 2008. Midterm years are still lackluster with propensity for the significant bottoms and pre-election years are still the tops.

&gt; This creates the sweet spot of the 4-year cycle from Q4 in the midterm year through Q2 in the pre-election year. From the midterm low to the pre-election year high DJIA averages a 45% gain since 1950 and NASDAQ averages a 70% gain since 1974.

&gt; # Neutral Sentiment Surge Continues

&gt; The AAII's weekly sentiment survey saw an equal percentage (30.6%) of respondents report as bullish and bearish last week. This week saw a much more optimistic pivot as 36.2% of respondents reported bullish sentiment. While higher, bullish sentiment is still at one of the lowest levels since last fall. At 36.2%, bullish sentiment is also now just below the historical average of 38%. While the AAII reading on bullish sentiment was higher but still muted, the Investors Intelligence survey of newsletter writers showed bullish sentiment fall 8.1 percentage points to 53.1%. While that is not a particularly low reading (the lowest since only the end of May), it was the largest one week decline since October 2019. In other words, bullish sentiment is not necessarily collapsing, but it has lost some footing.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/07/072921-AAII-Bull.png))**

&gt; With more bulls in the AAII survey, fewer respondents reported bearish sentiment. In fact, less than a quarter of investors reported bearish sentiment this week. That is down 6.5 percentage points from the prior week; the largest one-week decline since a 6.6 percentage point decline in the first week of June.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/07/072921-AAII-Bear.png))**

&gt; The inverse moves in bullish and bearish sentiment resulted in the bull-bear spread to rise 12.1 points. While off the lows, it is still not as strong of a reading as has been seen for most of this year. In fact, the current reading is 5.5 points below the average since the start of the year.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/07/072921-AAII-Spread.png))**

&gt; The most impressive sentiment reading this week was neutral sentiment. Over the past four weeks, neutral sentiment has risen 10.5 percentage points without a single decline in that time. That is the biggest four-week rise since mid-May when it had risen 14.9 percentage points. Now as the predominant sentiment with just below 40% of respondents reporting as such, neutral sentiment is at the highest level since the first week of 2020 when this reading was 1.2 percentage points higher.

&gt; # Services Consumption Lifts GDP Growth

&gt; Lofty expectations for second quarter gross domestic product (GDP) growth were left somewhat wanting as a decent headline number fell short of expectations. Peering under the hood, though, we think this is still a fairly solid report.

&gt; The Bureau of Economic Analysis released its preliminary estimate for second quarter GDP this morning, showing the U.S. economy grew at a 6.5% annualized pace against the Bloomberg median forecast for 8.4%. While this represented a small acceleration from the first quarter’s 6.3% pace, investors viewed the headline number as a mild disappointment in light of the heightened expectations. The composition of the growth, though, largely reinforces the prevailing narratives of a strong consumer juxtaposed with supply chain bottlenecks, restricting growth.

&gt; “The positive takeaway from today’s report is that we are clearly seeing a rebound in the in-person consumption of services,” said LPL Financial Chief Investment Strategist Ryan Detrick. “This indicates a confidence by consumers to reengage with the parts of the economy beaten down most by COVID, and continued momentum here will be key if we are to see the consumer continue to power overall growth.”

&gt; As seen in the LPL Chart of the day, the US consumer continued to do the heavy lifting, offsetting weakness in most other major GDP components.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/7.29.21-Blog-1-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Business fixed investment came in strong and demonstrated business’ attempts to ramp up output to meet surging demand. Residential investment had a more predictable decline, as well-documented labor shortages and high materials costs are restricting new projects. The volatile inventory components, though, did represent a drag.

&gt; Looking forward, we expect continued growth in the third quarter but with a different composition. Consumer spending should still be respectable, but likely will recede a bit due to the fading impact of past government transfer payments. New momentum in services as in-person commerce picks up should continue under the hood. Picking up the slack; though, business investment should continue to recover, and net exports may improve as the rest of the world plays catch-up to the U.S. in their recoveries, consuming more of our goods and services. Government spending and inventories also both have favorable outlooks.

&gt; The Delta variant of COVID-19 presents a risk to the outlook, but we see strong reason to remain optimistic. The U.S. is lagging the U.K. in its exposure to the Delta variant, and if we model our trajectory after theirs, which obviously is an imperfect comparison, we expect to see a peak in cases in the coming weeks. In fact, the U.K. is already on a strong path to recovery despite doomsday headlines. Domestically, COVID-19 cases are spiking in areas with the lowest vaccination rates. But, there is evidence that these are also the states experiencing the highest uptick in new vaccinations, which should help self-correct the trends. Positivity rates can be thought of as the fastest-twitch indicator, with hospitalization trends following in the ensuing weeks. Through that lens we see that some of the hardest hit states may have already seen their positivity rates peak.

&gt; We upgraded our 2021 forecast for U.S. real GDP growth earlier this year from 5–5.5% to 6.25–6.75%, and while there are sure to be bumps along the way, we expect to see the economy continue growing at a strong pace as activity further normalizes over the course of the year.

stocks,The 1 trillion dollar repo market simplified and highly reductive.,"Okay so today we saw 1 trillion in Repo market activity. Banks have too much cash. They throw it back to the Fed Treasury overnight at a .05%APR bond. As asinine as it sounds too much cash as a bank is a liability due to inflation. So in order to not get slaughtered by inflation they take meager returns from the Fed. Purchasing an overnight bond from the FED is considered an asset. But let's reduct this a bit. I can buy a bond with cash and that bond would be can asset to me. That's what banks are doing. They are shifting liability (cash) for an asset (bond). Now let's move to step 2. While the Fed is issuing bonds they are essentially issuing debt. You give me 1000 I'll pay you 1001 at the end of the night. This is alright due to the debt ceiling. But the debt ceiling is approaching. I believe congress will raise the debt ceiling. So that kicks can down road. They always have in past. But what worries me is banks that are absolutely flush with cash can't find a better use for it? There best guess is an overnight parking spot? Mind you if banks for example park 1,000,000 in this parking spot they are getting .005 over the year. .005x1,000,000 is $5000. $5000÷365 = $13.69 a night on a million dollars. Think about it if I was a bank and my business is making financial deals making 13 bucks on a million is dog shit. It's a waste. So why are they putting all this cash here? I don't doubt for a second that these banks are exponentially more savy than anyone in this subreddit and that's the most rational decision they could come to. Between loans, mortgages, investments, forex, construction, etc they chose to park it in a overnight parking garage for dog shit. This leads me to my finale. They park it here because this is the least risky option they have at there disposal and that's fucking scary. There in the business of keeping whatever they have and fucking you out of whatever you have. They're banks. It's in their nature a la scorpion and the bullfrog. Of the options at their disposal they chose this route because it's the only viable option at this juncture. That's scary. Especially since market wise the S&amp;P 500 hit new highs just yesterday. There are tons of options in money markets. There are even more options in loans for let's say corporate bonds but no they didn't pick them. They have no faith in lending to businesses even though there is need. If that was a viable option we wouldn't see 1,000,000,000,000 in dog shit overnight parking garages. They have no faith in the recovery of America out of the coronavirus bullshit. This should scare you. What happens when banks, our lifeline of credit stop interaction with the economy at large because of ""MuH .0o5%"". They simply ran out of good deals. In closing to back track a bit banks need assets as collateral for outstanding positions they have. In order to not get liquidated out of riskier positions they have to have enough assets on the books to keep the game going. This is a grown up margin call. I think alot of this reshuffling is meant to give our biggest banks ""assets"" that stand as collateral in the wake of underwater investments. Goldman Sachs JP Morgan Citi Credit Suisse etc do investment banking. They need to have assets to cover their bets or else face liquidation",finance

CryptoCurrency,Cold Wallet and Seed Dilemma,"This post is not to oversimplified the complex problem for being ones own bank, but rather it is to look at it from a different perspective. A perspective that it is considered a sin for the Cryptocurrency community. There are always comments and posts asking where to physically store a cold wallet and the seed. It is clear that the main disadvantages of using any type of physical method to keep the seed safe whether it is a titanium plate with the words engraved on it, is that it could fall in the wrong hands or it could be misplaced and end up lost forever. Conversely, instead of write down the seed in something physical and  have to worry on how to properly store it; the seed could be stored digitally offline and secured by cryptography. Some may argue that the seed must never be typed in an electronic device other than ones hardware wallet at the moment of recovery. Moreover, the price of a hardware wallet might be more than young people is willing to invest in Cryptocurrency or if Cryptocurrency is meant to give financial freedom to the poor in poor countries, investing in a hardware wallet is not an affordable solution. Aside from the price, there is another factor that makes physical storage of Cryptocurrency inconvenient, which it is the fact that one could misplace it.

In contrast, virtual storage solves the inconvenient of a single copy or an obvious unencrypted seed by allowing the user to create multiple copies and scatters them as much as the user wants. This can be accomplished by trusting nobody but cryptography. In particular, a good way to achieve the ultimate goal of trust  is by using FOSS (Free Open Source Software) that has been tested throughout time like: Tails, Electrum, KeePassXC, and Veracrypt. Before start to use these various software, the user must verify their integrity and verify they were signed by the authentic authors with PGP using GPG. Above all, the step of verifying integrity and signatures of all the software it is paramount. This is to mitigate the possibilities of download compromised software. Once the software is downloaded and verified it is time to create the cold wallet and safeguard the seed using the previously mentioned software. Tails is a GNU/Linux distribution that focus in anonymity and privacy and it will be used in this setup. Electrum it is an open source wallet that has a large community of developers since 2011, it is the wallet that comes per-installed on Tails, however, the .Appimage  will be needed in case the user wants to use a different OS. KeePassXC it is a free open source password manager recommended by PrivacyToolsIO, it will be used to stored the seed in an encrypted database. Veracrypt it is the free open source utility for on-the-fly encryption that can create a virtual encrypted disk to better protect the KeePass file where the seed will be kept. Also, the Electrum .AppImage downloaded will be used as watch-only wallet and it could be used on a different OS to generate receiving addresses and to see the balance in the cold wallet. Of course, the user is welcome to use another well known distribution like Fedora or Debian for this setup as long as the integrity and signature of the software is verified prior to use.

The following sounds complex, but should only take minutes to complete for someone technical who knows how to use these tools. Step zero it is selecting the passphrase, which it is the key step (literally) because it grants the user access to its money. Therefore, selecting a good strong passphrase that it is not a famous quote or a recycled passphrase it is extremely important. For a passphrase to be effective it must be long (6+ words), contain numbers, special characters, lowercase letters, uppercase letters, never been used before, and it must mean something to the user so that it can be easily remembered. This passphrase will protect the encrypted volume created with VeraCrypt, that has the database file created with password manager, which contains the seed and private key for the wallet. Therefore, the passphrase will be how to access the user’s money. The first step is to create a new database using KeePassXC. The following step is create a Standard VeraCrypt Volume to store the database on it. Next, create an offline wallet using Electrum and generate a seed. Later, the user must copy the seed and paste the seed in the KeePassXC database file previously created and save it.

Once the seed has been safely encrypted it can now be distributed in copies to anyone, anywhere, anyhow. This is to avoid the main problem of misplacing the seed and without worrying that someone might gain unauthorized access the user’s private key or seed. It is worth to highlight that under any circumstances the user can input the passphrase used to guard its seed in an online device or an unknown computer. How can one remember such a long passphrase? Through practice. The user should crate a new database using a password manager to store credentials that are accessed in a daily basis and use the same passphrase previously implemented to save the seed. Although, there is a great concern of the user’s passphrase being somehow intercepted through any mean of hacking or scamming, a passphrase alone it is only one piece for the puzzle. Thus, it is worthless if the attacker does not know about the existence of the VeraCrypt volume created to store a database that contains the user’s seed. Besides, the attacker would need the encrypted file in the first place. At any rate, the user can opt not to use the same passphrase anywhere else and decide to hide it in plain sight. In contrast, 12 words or 24 words that make no sense are particular, they cannot be hidden in plain sight. On the other hand, a phrase that makes sense to the user and to anybody else can be saved anywhere in the user’s notes, or even in the captions for a picture in social media. Hardly someone would guess it is a passphrase. Once again, even if someone figure out that this could be a passphrase, it is worthless if the attacker does not know where to use it.",cryptocurrency

My grandmother passed away two years ago today. I got a check from her estate today from a bank called Navy Federal. I am aware of the bank and how it’s a small bank meant for military families. I tried to deposit the check today at my local Chase, but the check says it has already been processed. I know for sure the check has not been processed yet, but I did not want to risk the chance of losing the check. I have my uncle that is POA to look into for me tomorrow or Monday. 


Does this thing usually happen with a Credit Union like Navy Federal? If so, what actions should I take for this? I know one of my uncles already cashed his check through a Navy Federal, but I have not heard from anyone else. I am not familiar enough with this situation.",finance

* **Five countries, clustered in the Caribbean, have fully launched CBDCs:** The Bahamas, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Antigua and Barbuda, Saint Lucia, and Grenada. Fourteen nations, including China, Sweden, and South Korea, are currently testing pilot currencies.
* **The number of countries working on CBDCs doubled during the pandemic.** As crypto gained steam and COVID revealed new use cases for digital currencies — from contactless payments to the distribution of stimulus funds — funding for CBDC research spiked.
* **China is poised to become the first major economy to fully roll out a CBDC.** Even though the digital yuan is still in its pilot phase, it’s already being used for transportation, meals, and more in parts of the country.
* **Visitors to China will also be able to use the digital yuan** without having to open a [bank account](https://links.coinbase.com/u/click?_t=3aca56371967418192255878e9689713&amp;_m=3513024ff5ef441382d1102767aa0d24&amp;_e=SRmv7VdPi0fRNaOJ3TIi51orr2l3H8vGP1H4svNJzGvzZTO_YF2x4ZznBa4kKf9fya0RLPHgC2YbbwU_g48Um111CseouxKXTkgfc5BRFDHUTHk1TyZW1PWKbhItW-3Fv0AzcsgDp0iWNUCIWpAefT5x3_jxvOqArH7D9V0AgIDjgNRev2K17OkoRV5aITlTpvDdJb3H0AKG-nLiJq7VOjpO0n5LnoXJwlSZvhBmUyaf7iiSjv2zZmFM2njiLD_PJTTqis8pxUhJF0wvC1uZlfzzYAT7Br9wLb10H3PgyLNWrD049h8jjUqodxOS-ArDf-reFZUnUAYkee2Dvf7oMx0-I-s_X72PJGr7JHMBkyaM8o7WYUN02MZXuHfKaKz2C1hU6GtqFPiUQHfX9Kvm708DyvF1XwlqryDTdVMZE4JuH3rWa3SzTQHnCT8ZsQUqNg4HUnFPWxgVGoo6QRataxlam8KGuPHTHjwYSgD_V18%3D).

CryptoCurrency,Anatomy of a FUD article,"This is going to be a long one so strap in, grizzled crypto veterans will probably already know this. 

We in the crypto community often use the term FUD. As many of us know it stands for fear uncertainty and doubt. Often this term is used by YouTubers for any information they don't want to hear and might be bad for their bags. That isn't what I'm talking about today. 

I am talking about weapons grade FUD. FUD designed specifically to try to encourage you to drop your bags. Sneaky FUD that makes you think it was your own choice. FUD that is  wrapped in a blanket of ""news"".  FUD specifically designed to scare off new investors. A huge number of institutions/people seem to have a vested interest in spreading FUD in an attempt to swing sentiment. So let's look at the latest FUD and see how it holds up. This article was posted July 30th at around 10 am EST. 

https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/07/30/should-bitcoin-dogecoin-ethereum-investors-panic/

First let's talk headlines. People don't often read far past them and they tell you a lot about the goals of the article. Our headline is ""Why Bitcoin, Dogecoin, and Ethereum investors are panicking today""

That headline is immediately designed for you to take it as fact that they are panicking. The article states it as fact and then the rest of the article is framed around why people are panicking. This is a trick to establish credibility and a narrative while simultaneously deflecting from the fact that the article is trying to make you panic. There was no panic this morning.

The article then follows up with facts then loaded language. 

&gt;In twin reports out this morning, we learned the International Monetary Fund is not a fan of cryptocurrency -- and that the United States Congress is getting serious about taxing people's profits from investments in cryptocurrencies.

&gt;As of 9:45 a.m. EDT, the prices of several of the biggest names in cryptocurrency are tumbling:

First they hit you with some facts to make this article seem less like the opinion piece it is. Then immediately it switches to fear with the word ""tumbling"". Here are the numbers they called tumbling. 

&gt;Dogecoin (CRYPTO:DOGE) is down 2.3%.
&gt;Bitcoin (CRYPTO:BTC) is falling 2.8%.
&gt;Ripple (CRYPTO:XRP) has tumbled most of all -- down 3.5%.
&gt;Ethereum (CRYPTO:ETH) is falling least of all -- down only 1.5%.

In crypto we know this is a fart in the wind, hardly tumbling. The writer knows that but they want to drive home why this space is a bad investment. I mean if they were framing it as a good investment wouldn't a little ""tumbling"" be a good time to buy? 

So they talk about the IMF's report where they say they dislike Bitcoin as a national currency. Nothing in this paper is really new to the crypto space. They have transitioned away from talking about why crypto is falling today and instead they pull out some key phrases you have probably seen before. 

&gt;IMF argues that crypto will not prove popular in ""countries with stable inflation and exchange rates, and credible institutions""

&gt;And of course, IMF also points out that cryptocurrency is often used to ""launder ill-gotten money, fund terrorism, and evade taxes.""    

&gt;Calling cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin ""extremely volatile,"" not good for people who need to ""store value,""

You all hear that. Your rapidly appreciating asset funds terrorism! It doesn't store value! It's never going to be useful if your country is doing well at all, after all you have the very ""credible institutions"" to work with. I'm sure there are lots of those where you live /s. 

This is designed to hit your brain on a few fronts. We all know terrorism is bad and don't want to be associated with it. It implies that you should feel insecure with your investment long term and you would be better of with these nebulous ""credible institutions"". So we have fear and doubt. There is one more letter in FUD though. The big U. 

Uncertainty is sneaky. It's designed to make your brain do a double take. Uncertainty aims to put you in a place where both yes and no are viable outcomes. First the article scares you, then it makes you doubt, lastly this article leaves you uncertain about the writers conclusion. This prompts you to make your own conclusion right after being fed fear and doubt. Look at this. 

&gt;Now what does all of this mean for cryptocurrency investors? I actually see both bad news and good in these reports. On the one hand, yes, the clear trend for crypto going forward appears to be for governments, and international organizations working with governments, to try to layer new reporting requirements, taxes, and other regulations on cryptocurrencies, which could diminish their attractiveness to investors and users alike.

&gt;On the other hand, I also suspect that Congress may get its hand caught in the cookie jar on this one. Once Washington becomes convinced that it can profit from taxing other people's cryptocurrency profits, it may become addicted to the new revenue stream, and afraid to see it cut off. Legislators may therefore become more inclined to regulate than ban cryptocurrencies outright.

So the end conclusion says basically nothing at all about why people were panicking. Nowhere to they cite panicking people. The article is barely related to the headline at all. It mostly talks about Bitcoin, meanwhile ETH, XRP, DOGE don't even get a mention. 

Guess what? After the day was done we were up another 8-9%. 

Those people who got tricked by this opinion piece sold their bags to people who made 8% the same day. My conclusion and what I want you to take away is that there are people out there trying to gain a competitive edge in the market through essentially propaganda. They are trying to shake you up and get into your head. When you read news articles try to do so with a critical eye.

I'm sure others can point out further hypocrisies in the article but this wall of text is long enough.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Leave my current job for this higher pay opportunity that feels risky?,"Hello! I was looking to find some guidance on a quick-moving opportunity that suddenly appeared on my plate. Here are the straight details:

-----------------------------------

**Job #1** (Current, I've been here 3 years):
**Salary**: $70,000/yr | **PTO**: 20 Days, 5 Sick, Federal Holidays | **Benefits**: Medical, Dental, Vision, 90% covered | **Retirement**: 401K + 1:1 matching up to a certain amount | **Stock**: None

- I have a pretty comfortable role here, good co-workers who I do consider my friends.

- 9AM to 6PM hours, 40 hours a week. Rarely overtime.

- This is a contract job, with no end period/time limit.

- This contract job is with a F500 tech company that provides some opportunity to move on as a full-hire,  but not guaranteed and pretty competitive. Moving on as a full-hire to the company is pretty much the big goal, but again it's pretty difficult to get in.

- I have grown a bit discontent with my current role because they haven't given me a raise since hiring me three years ago, despite making (verbal) promises to.

-----------------------------------

**Job #2**
**Hourly**: $60/hr | estimated $124,800/yr | **PTO**: None, no sick days, no holidays | **Benefits**: Medical, Dental, Vision, 50% covered | **Retirement**: None | **Stock**: None

- 6AM to 2PM hours, 40 hours a week. Sometimes overtime. Even though PTO/sick is ""none"", it doesn't mean I can't take sick or vacation days, it just means I am not getting paid for it.

- This is also a contract job for a F500 company, but the contract is set to ""end"" at the end of 2021 and be put up for renewal. However, I've been told that this contract has been going on for 4 years and has been renewed each year since 2017. None of the workers are cut/let go during the renewal process. They have others on this contract who have been with the project for that duration. Even though they have given me some confidence that I won't be let go at the end of 2021, I'm also aware of the seasonal hiring spike that occurs right before the Holidays, which is usually followed by an exodus of employees. The only thing I have in my favor is that my line of work doesn't really have 'seasonal' hiring behavior like this, but it still feels awfully like it - this could just be me psyching myself out though.

- The recruitment manager seems to have a really fast pace in getting me through the hiring process, though I don't know why. It almost feels like they need to fill a spot ASAP, but haven't explicitly told me that.

- I've been in contract positions in the past that have an ""end date"", and I told myself to be incredibly wary of these because that essentially means that if I don't get renewed, I'll have to be back looking for a job at the end of that stated cycle. However, they got me connected with the Account Manager and they were the ones who told me this contract renews every year and that there is a level of confidence I'd be there longer than four months. I just don't know whether or not to take this risk on their good faith.

- For some reason this hiring agency is also incredibly shrouded in mystery. They don't have much of an internet footprint. There is very little to no information found on job websites like Linkedin, Glass Door, or a Wiki page. They've allegedly been around since 2017 and sound like they're a very small hiring company in the US. I can't find any information about them, so I am unsure if leaving my current employer for another that I have very little information on is risky? On the other hand, the F500 company I will be working for at the end of the day does have information I can lookup, and I'll be in an environment that I can be informed about. I am just unclear about the hiring agency staffing me in the job.

-----------------------------------

Altogether I feel like my current role has good offerings in an all-around sense. The pay, benefits, environment, etc. (although them not giving me a raise in 3 years is kind of disappointing). However, this new opportunity is just a very substantial increase in base wage, but they don't provide that all-around coverage in PTO, retirement, etc. while also being fairly unknown to me as a company because their internet profiles are incredibly small/brief. I can't lookup reviews of the company or get any clue on what the culture/working condition/employees are like. I am unsure of what to do in this sense so would appreciate any insights.

15. It’s a good sign that the top two crypto communities are spending so much time talking negatively about Cardano. You only focus your hatred on that which is most threatening. I’m glad to see we’re the biggest threat on their radar. [https://twitter.com/nic\_\_carter/status/1405194146063736840](https://twitter.com/nic__carter/status/1405194146063736840)

17. All 345,501 of the people who have watched the Lex Fridman/Charles episode as of writing are realizing that Cardano could be the first project to put voting on the blockchain in a U.S. state. [https://www.atalaprism.io/app](https://www.atalaprism.io/app)
18. It looks like the second biggest ETH stakepool or it's custody provider has lost it’s users private keys to $75MM in ETH. Cardano doesn’t have this problem. We get to keep custody of our crypto because we found a better way than slashing. [https://stakehound.com/blog-post/fireblocks-eth-2-key-management-incident/](https://stakehound.com/blog-post/fireblocks-eth-2-key-management-incident/) [https://twitter.com/JamesSpediacci/status/1407465311180255236](https://twitter.com/JamesSpediacci/status/1407465311180255236)

21. The June Cardano 360 is currently available on Youtube. [https://youtu.be/al5m14299ww](https://youtu.be/al5m14299ww)
22. We saw segments on various newer partner entities like Nervos, Orion Protocol, and Revuto. Nervos is a UTXO proof-of-work blockchain which is building a cross-chain bridge with Cardano so that you can use your ADA on Nervos dApps and vice versa. Interoperability is a big theme for Nervos and they plan to have a working testnet within a month. Orion Protocol is building a terminal that will allow for decentralized non-custodial trading across centralized and decentralized exchanges. They say this would not require you to KYC or even have an account with any of these exchanges. Revuto is an online subscription management service that recently completed a $10MM token sale on Cardano.
23. It was also revealed that Wolfram Labs, COTI, and IOHK have a three-way partnership (a ménage à tech) to build an NFT auction site. The people from Wolfram were talking about very interesting things including live minting during streaming events and automated upload to IPFS. COTI will be building out auction and bidding mechanisms in ADAPay.
24. Professor Aggelos Kiayias gave us an update on research including that Ouroboros Chronos and Hydra papers have both been accepted into conferences/journals. Chronos will provide Cardano with a global concept of time that doesn’t rely on any outside timekeeper. Prof. Kiayias also pointed out that Hydra is distinguishable from other layer two protocols in that the scripting language is identical to that of the base layer in Cardano such that any dApp that can run on Cardano will run on the Hydra L2. This is a huge plus and superior to many other layer two solutions in other ecosystems where the base layer dApps will not run on layer two. Finally, the Mithril paper has been submitted for peer review. It will provide Cardano light wallets with Succinct Non-interactive Arguments of Knowledge that will give us the best of both worlds: no delays for syncing as in full node wallets while still preserving trustlessness.
25. Finally, the Goguen Summit will be in late September. Sign up now at [summit.cardano.org](http://summit.cardano.org/).
26. The Fed is once again STRONGLY signalling to us that they are going to regulate stablecoins. The Fed is also specifically calling out Tether for the first time. You need to be thinking about how stablecoin regulation might affect your favorite Cardano DeFi or other project. [https://twitter.com/CaitlinLong\_/status/1408500265397985282](https://twitter.com/CaitlinLong_/status/1408500265397985282) [https://twitter.com/CaitlinLong\_/status/1408572624125534212](https://twitter.com/CaitlinLong_/status/1408572624125534212)
27. People are starting to realize that the Stakehound private key loss in ETH may attract unwanted regulatory attention to Ethereum 2.0 while this problem could never have occurred in Cardano. Also, only a few days later another ETH stakepool (this time SharedStake...the sixth biggest ETH Stakepool) allegedly experiences a rugpull that some are valuing at over $30MM. This is another problem that could not happen in Cardano staking. It feels like we stepped into the ring, they rang the bell, and ETH just started punching itself in the head. Eventually it’s going to KO itself.

29. John O’Connor of IOHK points out that France still controls the monetary policy of 14 countries in Africa.

42. Robert Kornacki of dcSpark releases an article on why every Cardano dApp will use NFTs. The article contains some very interesting discussion on smart contracts in the EUTXO context including language instructing that “UTXOs have smart contracts attached to them and not the other way around” and “\[...\]the simplest way to think about it is that when a UTXO is created it has the option to have a smart contract attached to it.” [https://medium.com/dcspark/every-eutxo-dapp-will-use-nfts-and-heres-why-fd87e6a8c9a6](https://medium.com/dcspark/every-eutxo-dapp-will-use-nfts-and-heres-why-fd87e6a8c9a6)

In news that could have significant repercussions for many stablecoin reliant Cardano DeFi projects, Fed Chair Jerome Powell gave some hard signals that they will regulate stablecoins in House Committee testimony. He revealed that the Fed will issue its long-awated paper on stablecoins, CBDCs, and other digital assets in September. Powell also went as far as to say ""You wouldn't need stable coins you wouldn't need cryptocurrencies if you had a digital US currency, I think that's one of the stronger arguments in its favor.""

85. The El Faro article reporting meetings between Cardano, Whizgrid of Cyprus, and the brothers of President Bukele of El Salvador definitely contain some extremely interesting details related to a possible Salvadorean national stablecoin by the end of the year and a possible digitization and blockchain storage of a wide range of government related documents next year.

88. Notable news for upcoming Cardano DeFi projects. There may be slightly less competition in the “get a return on your crypto assets” game very soon. The New Jersey AG’s office has delivered a cease and desist letter to BlockFi. The AG’s press release cited BlockFi’s interest bearing deposit accounts as unregistered securities and also mentioned the lack of FDIC or SPIC insurance for it’s depositors. This leaves some lingering questions for Cardano DeFi projects that might be planning to accept deposits or other transfers of value and offering a return of sorts. You could argue that these projects are decentralized where BlockFi was not. But, the AG’s press release seems to cite decentralization as one of the risks of DeFi projects. Also, as a practical matter, there is a question whether decentralization will be a good shield from regulators since many of these projects have companies and real humans with faces and names behind them unlike a truly anonymous founder such as Satoshi Nakamoto.

stocks,Current strategy: value thesis and allocations.,"Hey folks.  First let me clarify that I'm sharing because I like sharing, not because I think my strategy is the end-all, be-all or something that everyone needs to learn from.  I do think it's well thought out, but there's a high probability that it underperforms other strategies or simply passive investing.  Time will tell.  I have tailored it to my needs, and it is also the fruit of my understanding of the global economic situation, which is, of course, limited.  Everyone is entitled to their own opinion about things.

As I said, I am sharing today because I enjoy sharing. As a reader you may get the most value from this by looking at my value picks. For those who have somewhat of a bear thesis or are totally lost in today's market, you may also find my analysis of the current market somewhat insightful.  I also briefly mention tailoring my investing to my individual needs, which I believe is something that is often overlooked.

I welcome any questions or comments.  So, without further ado:


**Strategy**

I'm a young adult and have been investing regularly in a target retirement fund for a few years now. I had a lot of cash savings this year for a few reasons (stimulus checks, less spending thanks to Covid, gift from parents, etc.). I got involved in the GME saga because I believed in the message, foolishly or not, and that was when I realized I could start putting my money to work in a more active fashion apart from my regular retirement contributions. 

I've calculated it and my retirement should be okay given my current contributions. My passive strategy here will remain unchanged. But my job security is uncertain going forward and I'd like to start building a medium-term nest egg ASAP so that, basically, I can continue being comfortable working as little hours as possible (my current job allows for this but I may not have it forever).

I absolutely understand the benefits of passive investing, and obviously I engage in it myself.  But seeing such high valuations in the market, I decided that it was not a good idea to make a giant lump sum into them right now.  My opinion is that averaging in is fine, but given that this investment is a one-off I am afraid to lose capital in the event of a sudden downturn.  No matter what your opinion is, valuations are high right now.

Furthermore, I have somewhat of a bear thesis and do not think that our current monetary policy is sustainable in the long-term without causing some serious unintended consequences.  When?  Nobody knows.  But debt stocks and assets prices go up every day, and markets continue to drift further and further from fundamentals.  Leading economists like Paul Krugman do not see an issue here.  Some noted economists like William White disagree, however, and do sense danger (great source [here](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://www.dallasfed.org/assets/documents/institute/wpapers/2012/0126.pdf&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjWj6rk64zyAhWKDsAKHR8RCpcQFjAAegQIAxAC&amp;usg=AOvVaw2RnvpT2PuFVPBdG3wJHi-C), albeit a bit old).

With all of that in mind, for my active strategy I am avoiding what I view as overvalued growth stocks and focusing strictly on value and dividends.  I have been building this position slowly over the last few months, but my intention is to maintain significant cash reserves and use them to snatch up good (primarily growth) companies as soon as we have a significant correction or downturn.  

I am also a fan of companies that make or invest in real, tangible things (tobacco, food, real estate, etc.) because in the event we do have a downturn these are the companies that are most likely to continue to perform and pay dividends.  


**Allocations**

This is excluding my retirement fund which I make regular contributions to.  The allocations are roughly intended to be equal but I'm slowly building some of the positions.

**BNS** - Bank of Nova Scotia - This is a Canadian dividend stock with a long history of reliable and increasing dividends.  My understanding is that Canadian banks are more regulated than their US counterparts and are thus safer.  Note that they do take 15% off the top of the dividend for foreign investors. 

**BTI** - British American Tobacco - They serve the whole world, unlike Philip Morris or Altria.  They are also trading at an extremely low multiple (P/E of 10.  The dividend is safe and with a very attractive yield.  Billionare investor Kenneth Dart recently built a huge stake in them ([source](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://amp.ft.com/content/a56c4bc5-ae11-4de7-be56-4c95ec85d1fb&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjpv7re7YzyAhXVPsAKHdcQAFQQFjACegQIJBAC&amp;usg=AOvVaw3IS95GVAoh-1vrN_n2iWHz&amp;ampcf=1)), I'm assuming because he saw really good value in a market that's hard to find value in.  

**EDPFY** - Energias de Portugal - International energy company that is over 80% renewable and with huge contracts worldwide.  Growth is slow with this one, it's not a market-disrupting renewables company, but they're already in the space so that guarantees future sustainability.   The dividend yield is attractive (currently about 5%), although they do take 25% off the top, unfortunately. Still a solid defensive play IMO.

**FDP** - Fresh Del Monte Produce - US-based fruit company with international operations. They trade at an extreme discount because investors lost interest due to a semi-recent dividend cut.  I view the dividend cut as a positive because they used it to pay down debt and change up the business model.  Their new e-commerce operations have been performing very well.  I like this company because, no matter what, people need to eat, and they've been delivering reliably for over 30 years. 

**IMBBY** - Imperial Brands - Another tobacco company, Kenneth Dart also bought a small stake in them. They are the fourth largest tobacco company.  The bulk of their operations are in the US, Europe, Australia, and the Middle East.  They trade at an extreme discount when looking at their free cash flow.  I believe this is due to the fact that they have lagged behind on next-generation nicotine products and I think the market doubts the sustainability of the business.  I disagree, however, as I think their cigarette business still has room to run, and new management is making turn arounds in the next-generation product line.  The dividend yield of nearly 9% is highly, highly attractive.  All indications are that it is sustainable in the medium-term, but I will watch this company closely for potential signs of weakness going forward. 

**LMT** - Lockheed Martin - The US isn't going to stop buying planes or other weaponry anytime soon.  Despite some recent setbacks in their F-35 program, and questions about management or their future with the Biden administration, this company can only continue to grow.  Geopolitical tensions with China, not least of which due to Taiwan, are ramping up. Not only is it trading at a nice valuation (P/E of 15) with a decent dividend of about 3%, it's also a wonderful hedge in the event that shit does hit the fan.  I doubt it, but it doesn't hurt to be prepared.

**NTDOY** - Nintendo - What can I say?  I love the Nintendo brand.  It's a great company with no debt, a large cash position, and great free cash flow which currently trades at a great multiple (P/E lower than 15). The forward dividend yield is showing 4%, although my understanding is that their dividend can be somewhat unreliable. I entered into this one yesterday because it's been trending down for the last few months.  I was very heavy on value so I was eager to get at least some tech exposure, and what better way than in a strong, reliable international company? 

**UVV** - Universal Corp - This is the world's largest grower of leaf tobacco.  They sell to all the world's major tobacco companies, including China Tobacco. There's not much growth if any left here, but I'm confident that their business is sustainable due to the fact that people will continue smoking, and new heat-not-burn products products that involve tobacco, are catching on as alternatives to smoking.  They also have a small investment in a fruit company. Attractive valuation with an attractive dividend (6%).

I also have a position in **PAAS** - Pan American Silver Corp and **GSG** - iShares Commodity Trust.  PAAS is to get exposure to gold and silver, but I have stopped adding to my position at the moment because they're having some political issues with their El Escobal mine in Peru.  The GSG trust is to give me broad-based commodity exposure as a portfolio and inflation hedge.

**Watchlist:**

These are fan favorites and don't require much explanation, except for WPC which is an internationally diversified REIT.  I am eagerly awaiting better valuations to snatch these up.  MSFT and AAPL are my top picks but I will enter what I can with good valuations.

**AAPL** - Apple.

**KO** - Coca Cola.

**MCD** - McDonald's.

**MSFT** - Microsoft.

**NSRGY** - Nestlé.

**WPC** - WP Carey.

Anyway, that's all folks!  Good luck to all!",finance

I would like to keep 10% in bonds or cash to take advantage of rebalancing. 

But I'm not sure how I feel about bonds right now. If you are buying bonds now, isn't that kind of like betting interest rates will go negative? I know bonds tend to go down in value when interest rates go up. And it seems a common theme now is investors shorting bonds, which is a little scary to be honest. 

The Cash fund offered in my plan is "" Invesco Stable Val Trust CF"", which basically tracks the ""[FTSE 3 Month US T-Bill Index Series""](https://www.ftserussell.com/products/indices/3m-us-tbill). It has a 0.35% expense ratio, which is kind of high for a cash fund imo.

personalfinance,Requesting help deciding between 2 student loan payoff strategies,"Throwaway account -

Hi - I'm looking for some 3rd party advice regarding which strategy to take in tackling my federal student loans. I'm trying to figure out whether or not it's worth it to allocate a 30k lump sum payment towards my balance at the end of September 2021 or if I should use that money for other investments while continuing to make minimum payments for 20 more years and then receive REPAYE based forgiveness. Any help is appreciated.

Context: I'm 31 years old with 95k in Graduate level federal loans currently in IBR REPAYE. I've made minimum payments since Jan 2017, so I have 20 more years of minimum payments until I am forgiven. The loans are roughly as follows:

13k @ 6.69%

24k @ 6.69%

13k @ 6.59%

22k @ 5.96%

22k @ 5.59%

Option 1: Make a 30k lump sum payment at the end of September 2021 and reduce my principial balance to \~65k. Once I do this, I can continue to make 500/month payments and will be beating the accruing interest. At the rate of 500/month I will pay off the loans by 2038. Over the next 20-ish years this strategy will cost me around 130k in total.

Option 2: At 500/month I will match the interest accruing on the account and the balance will not increase. Therefore over the next 20 years the 500/month payments will amount to around 120k. At that point the 95k balance will be forgiven as income on my tax return resulting in a roughly 47k tax bomb. Therefore, over the next 20-ish years this strategy will cost me around 170k in total.

20 years is a pretty long investment timeline and I'm having second thoughts about pursuing option 1 when I could throw that 30k into VOO style ETF investments instead. By using strategy 2, I'm assuming that A. my investments will negate the adverse effects of the tax bomb, B. my earning potential and net worth will have increased to a position in which 47k added to my income tax won't be a HUGE deal. I know it's riskier and not guaranteed, but it doesn't seem totally unreasonable. Can anyone help me think through this? Curious to hear your thoughts and thanks for the help.",finance
CryptoCurrency,Bank suggestions?,"Hi everyone,

I’m currently using PNC to handle all of my banking. Unfortunately, I’m having a really difficult time to get it to connect to CB Pro. I’ve been on the phone with PNC support multiple times trying to see if anything can be done, and I have had a ticket in with CB Pro support for a while now (they’ve been pretty useless).

My understanding from a few people in this sub and some simple googling efforts is that PNC is anti-crypto. I’m pretty fed up at this point, and while I like PNC’s virtual wallet design, it really does nothing for me.

I’m considering switching banks and am curious which ones you guys prefer? I’m based out of the US and dont care whether the bank has physical branches. I prefer to have all my non-brokerage banking accounts under a single entity, but I’d consider having checking at one bank and savings at another.

I’m leaning towards Discover at the moment.

I appreciate your input!",cryptocurrency
CryptoCurrency,Tinfoil hat time. The RRP hit an all time high yesterday. Could the banks be parking liquidity every night in hopes that any day now they can add cyrpto to their balance sheet?!?!,"So if you’ve been following the stock market you know the reverse repo rate has sky rocketed recently. Some subs are reporting new high scores for it every day. Well it just crossed a trillion dollars. 

https://www.np.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ourri0/daily_reverse_repo_hits_historic_high_over_1/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf

Now I don’t have much knowledge of these reverse repos or anything really, but my loose understanding is as follows: 

Cash is a liability for the banks. A banks function to me and you is somewhere we store money, but what happens to all that money??? Well the bank invests it of course and pays you a very small APR for letting them invest it and make a bundle. Problem is the banks (who are the biggest investors in the world) aren’t willing to invest that money right now in the traditional equity markets, I believe they see stocks and other derivatives as a bubble and don’t want to be caught holding the bag when it bursts. The problem is they are still paying me and you to hold that money for us. This is why cash is a liability for the bank. The more they have sitting around not making money the more they bleed. 

In come the reverse repo repurchases. So instead of bleeding every day the FED created this nifty program for them a few decades back. Instead of sitting around and bleeding let me throw a bandaid on you every night. So the banks send the money to the fed, the fed holds on to it and in the morning the fed gives the money back plus .05%APR. This is a yearly interest rate payed daily so a  minuscule amount compared to a return a hedge fund could give them in the casino of the stock market. 

So who fucking cares and how does this relate to cyrpto?? So as I lay around hungover this morning looking at the chaos that is the world I had a tin foil hat,full blown Alex jones,nothing is provable in a court of law,but god damnit it feels good, moment. Why wouldn’t the banks just keep doing what they always have and just give their buddies on wall street the money to get them a fat ass 7% APR? Well 1 the banks are scared shitless of what these over leveraged rats have done to the market this year and 2 when they do that their money is tied up. “Insert Michael burry in the big short telling his clients they can’t withdraw their funds memes”.

So the banks are obviously signaling the market is fucked, no bet is safe. And we all know (them probably better then us) that inflation is hitting like a shit brick house. They want to stay liquid Incase of market crash and parking their money at the FED each night is the only way to do it without being bled out by their customers. What could they possibly be planning with all that money?? What deflationary asset that they can’t currently add to their balance sheet (but is one of the most liquid in human history) could they be waiting to add??

You got that right boys and girls. From stage left enters crypto. It’s the perfect opportunity for them to balance their ugly balance sheets. When fiat money, the thing their business is built on, starts to fall apart why would they want to hold more and more of it on a daily basis? They don’t want to they need to so when the Us govt finally gives them the green light they can buy up all the crypto in sight.  

Just look at your boy Glon Fusk(hope I spelt that right) his company made more money on BTC gains then it’s primary function of selling cars some quarters. I personally think it helped fend off the massive short attack against them.

Again this is pure speculation from a hungover moron who hasn’t had his breakfast weed yet. I’m sure you can poke holes all over it and please do, but I for one think this growing amount of liquid cash is intentional not accidental. Pair this speculation with recent news that large banks are currently allowing wealth clients to invest in cyrpto markets (think of this as them protecting their biggest customers first)and I think we are first hand watching the largest adoption of cyrpto currency ever. The same institutions that tried to write it off and kill it are now being forced to plan for and adopt it, and that has me bullish as fuuuuuuuuuuck.

TLDR; I speculate that the current RRP market is signaling that big money is currently scared shitless of fiat and this is forcing them to be ready at any moment to start adding deflationary cyrpto assets to their balance sheets to protect themselves from the current global economy.",cryptocurrency

Market Wrap: Bitcoin Hits Two-Month High After Late Day Surge

After spending most of the day in negative territory, cryptocurrencies made a late surge on Friday with bitcoin hitting its highest level since mid-May. Bitcoin is currently trading above $41,000 at press time and is up more than 15% over the past week. Bullish sentiment has returned after a sharp sell-off in May and two months of consolidation above the $30,000 support level.

Some analysts are optimistic and expect buyers to remain active above the 50-day moving average, which is above $34,000 now.

“We have been talking about the market having lower liquidity during the summer for a few weeks now and we think this helps explain the sharp price action we saw that triggered the short squeeze of nearly $1 billion in futures liquidations,” David Grider, a strategist at FundStrat, wrote in a Thursday newsletter.

Grider stated that bitcoin’s spike could reflect a flight to safety from Chinese investors looking to “get out at any cost,” given the recent sell-off in Asian equities. “Bitcoin could have been trading as a proxy tool for investors looking for a hedge,” Grider wrote.

#####Next Fed rate-hiking cycle might be shallow

Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell assured markets this week that the U.S. central bank is considering when to start winding down its program of purchasing $120 billion in bonds every month, but Wall Street analysts are already wondering what will come after that.

Bitcoin,Update to my nightmare with blockchain.com,"1)  On July 9, I sent 2 wires to my blockchain wallet ($5,000 and $8,000). I did not put the reference number per the instructions - I put my name instead. This was my error. Chat support said the wires were received and then rejected. It is now 22 days since I sent the wires and blockchain.com has not responded to my request for a refund. This is the easiest fix - every wire has a federal reserve reference number and the funds can easily be returned via the reference number. In fact, if a wire is actually rejected, this is an automated process and the funds are usually back in the sender's account within 24 hours. It's now 22 days since a ticket was opened! I was asked to provide a copy of a bank statement which I did. All I have received since are automated emails. The emails ask me to click on a link and check for updates. There are no updates - not a word. The emails also state that if I don't respond within a few days, the ticket will be closed. I respond every time, then nothing, then another automated email that has no update. 22 days to do nothing - they don't need a copy of my bank statement, they don't need anything at all. They have the federal reserve reference number which is all they need to return the money to the bank account where it came from.  


2)  I sent the 2 wires because I needed to send BTC urgently for my business. I knew there was a delay because of the missing blockchain.com reference #, so I sent in another wire on July 12 for $25,000. The $25k was credited to my account and I bought BTC. I tried to send $12k of BTC value on July 12 and my account was put on a hold. My activity shows deposit $25k and BTC purchase and my balance now is $42. The activity report does not show what happened to the missing $24,958? Again, a ticket was opened on July 12th and there has been absolutely no action or response, except for automated responses referring me to a link, and stating that if I don't respond within a few days they will close the ticket. Of course there is absolutely no update to the ticket every time!  


Blockchain.com does not deserve to have any customers. I have not just had poor service - I've had NO service after more than 3 weeks.

Trading,"Cash in QYLD, investments in TQQQ, QLD","Hi,
if you are here just to comment how risky levered etfs are, please avoid.

My current Portfolio: 10% TQQQ, 20% QLD, 10% AAPL, 30% cash, and 30% in value garbage i am bagholding by listening to some great analysts in CAT, BA, VIAC, PLTR etc.

My question is on the 30% cash i am holding:
What if i move the cash to QYLD. If market goes up sideways, i collect dividends. If market goes down, I plan to convert to QLD(5-7% correction), TQQQ(10-15% correction).

- I understand if market drops, i better be in cash. But it may or may not, why time it. I am not expecting more than 5-15% correction. I am ok loosing 15% of my QYLD if that happens as ill also give me the opportunity to move it to TQQQ.

- Why not cash in QQQ instead of QYLD as it has similar downside risk but much better upside potential: I already have the upside exposure with TQQQ, QLD. Also if you look at daily vol in QYLD, it is much higher right now even compare to the 2020 crash. Means more ppl are moving to QYLD.
- I understand QYLD is slowly depreciating, but my Time horizon is small as we will have some corrections for sure, so i will not be holding QYLD long term. 

If you dont like my strategy, please suggest how you allocate your cash. Certainly not in savings account as the interest rate is too low.

CryptoCurrency,Americans: Call your representatives to tell them you oppose the infrastructure bill crypto provision,"Context: [It appears](https://www.coindesk.com/new-infrastructure-bill-looks-to-raise-30b-through-crypto-taxes) a provision was recently added to the federal infrastructure bill that would require more crypto network participants to make mandatory disclosures to federal agencies. The purpose is to make it harder for crypto folks to commit tax fraud. You can get some color by listening to the latest [NLW podcast at the 6:30 minute mark](https://www.coindesk.com/podcasts/the-breakdown-with-nlw/crypto-race-fix-infrastructure-bill).

Problem: The provision appears to impose impossible standards that would make most crypto activity de-facto illegal in the US. For example, miners would have to surveil and report the transactions they process. Hardware and software wallet makers might be liable for surveilling their customers. Even DEXs would need to report to the government, whatever that means.

What you can do: Call your congresspeople and tell them the provision should be taken out - regulation is good but it has to be smart and it has to foster innovation not destroy it.

(Reuters is one of the few remaining truly hard news publishers).

""(Reuters) - Federal Reserve Governor Lael Brainard on Friday laid out a range of reasons for ""urgency"" around the issue of developing a U.S. central bank digital currency, *including the fact that other countries such as China are moving ahead with their own.*

""The dollar is very dominant in international payments, and if you have the other major jurisdictions in the world with a digital currency, a CBDC (central bank digital currency)offering, and the U.S. doesn't have one, I just, I can't wrap my head around that,"" Brainard told the Aspen Institute Economic Strategy Group. ""That just doesn't sound like a sustainable future to me.""

Fed officials are taking a deep dive into the digital payments universe, collecting public feedback on the potential costs and benefits as well as design considerations with a view to publishing a discussion paper in early September.

Fed Chair Jerome Powell in comments earlier this month described the analysis as a key step in accelerating the Fed's efforts to determine if it should issue its own CDBC.

""One of the most compelling use cases is in the international realm, where intermediation chains are opaque and long and costly,"" Brainard said on Friday.

But there are domestic reasons too for a U.S.-backed digital currency, she said: the dramatic rise in stablecoins, a form of cryptocurrency pegged to a conventional currency such as the U.S. dollar but not backed by any government.

Stablecoins could proliferate and fragment the payment system, or one or two could emerge as dominant, she said. Either way, ""in a world of stablecoins you could imagine that households and businesses, if the migration away from currency is really very intense, they would simply lose access to a safe government backed settlement asset, which is of course what currency has always provided.""

A CBDC could also help solve other problems, she suggested, including the difficulty during the pandemic of getting government payments to people without bank accounts, who also tend to be the very people who need the payments the most.""  
\----------

My opinion: 

Competition is going to make the Fed move.  It wants to ensure (1) the continued dominance of the USD as the world's reserve currency, (2) financial stability: if there is going to be a dominant US dollar stablecoin, it had better to be their own USDFRN, not USDC, and definitely not USDT.   


Those two developments may force the Fed into a CBDC.   The long-term economic advantages for the USA would be strong, particularly in other countries: it enables a very low cost USD transfer service, particularly if those holders could also earn interest (low as it is) from USDFRN directly, and risk-free, and without depending on foreign banks which have a habit of making access to money difficult, or forcibly converting dollar deposits to shitcoin fiat in a banking crisis. 

More and more of the world would be dollarized economically.   Banks would have to compete more honestly for deposits against a better alternative.
