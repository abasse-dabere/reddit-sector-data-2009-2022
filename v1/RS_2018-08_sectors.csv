personalfinance,Is too much taxes being taken out of my paycheck?,"Just stared a new job ($45,000 salary bi weekly) . Single, claimed 1 on my withholding

my start date was in the middle of second week pay period, so my first paycheck was only 1 weeks worth of pay. Total taxes taken out for 1 week of pay totaled $158.45

Federal:    $60.29

MA tax:     $32.13

Medicare: $12.55

OASDI :     $56.65

Gross income for 1 weeks worth of pay: $865.45

Net income for 1 weeks worth of pay  : $707.00

Unsure if my calculations are wrong, but are these taxes on my first week paycheck a reflection of what will be taken out weekly or monthly? If so, will my next (full 2 week) paycheck will have $316.90 taken out?? Every month will $633 be taken out for taxes?

This means for the year $316.90 x 26 = $8,239.2 will be taken total for taxes.

Federal taxes for the year will be $3,135.08

Does everything seem normal or should I adjust my withholding?

Thank you and appreciate the help!

personalfinance,"Going to have an on-campus job next semester in MA, but I have a question about taxes.","Hello, so when I go back to college this fall I'll be a Course Assistant making around $16/hr. After doing the math I figured I would be able to earn around $2.5-3k.

But, in addition to the earned income, I have some money invested through both Schwab and Robinhood with most likely less than $100 in dividend payments this year and with no realized gains.

Other than a few other bank accounts paying less than $10 interest a year, **I had a question about whether I have a tax filing obligation.**

I'll be claimed under my parents as a dependent, and from my research I think that means I'll be disqualified from personal-exemptions, which I think doesn't matter this year since Trump eliminated those anyway. 

But do I still receive the standard deduction of $12,000? And if so does that mean I don't have to file for my income/investments?

Also final question, since I'm not a resident of MA and my home state TX doesn't have income tax, do I qualify for the MA personal-exemption of $4,400 (and thus not have to file in MA either) even though I'm a dependent under my parents federal return?

Sorry is these questions don't make much sense, I'm pretty green with all this tax stuff and I don't post much so I don't know how to write these sort of posts.

Forex,Thoughts on fundamental analysis,"Hey guys, recently opened up my first forex account after two weeks of practice on a demo.  I have been lurking on this sub for about a month to get a better understanding of trading strategies, and have come up with a few questions:

I have noticed a lot of talk around technical analysis, and not much buzz about fundamentals. Has anyone built statistical models using counties GDP, CPI, interest rates, current account balance and so on? Would this be similar to building a free cash flow model for stock analysis? Interested in y’alls thoughts.

Also, in my experience with trading stocks, one of the hardest things to do is to know when to sell. How do you lock in your gains without getting too greedy and losing it all?

Finally, it seems like a lot of the pros here a day traders. What is your average holding period? One day, a few hours, months, a year?

personalfinance,"Only $5,144 in a 401k from previous employer. Should I cash out to pay out to pay a loan or roll into new 401k/Roth IRA","26 years old, got a new employer in June. I currently contribute 8% per bi-weekly pay period toward my retirement. Company matches 3% now and grows to 6% with time.  It’s not a big contribution from me, but it’s what I can do (student loans amirite). 

From my previous employer that I was with for 2.5 years, I have $5,144.40 in a 401k. It has stopped growing since I am no longer employed with the company. This is my only other retirement funds besides what I have with my new employer (maybe $500?). 

I have a personal loan that has a balance of $2,194. I am considering simply cashing out the old 401k and paying off the loan because it has a 14.99% interest rate. I pay $180 on it every month, and interests eats $42. It is my highest balance and highest interest rate debt (disregarding student loans). I think I could knock down the rest of my debt a lot faster with that extra $180 a month because they have low interest rates. 5.1k just seems like a small amount to have in a 401k that there may be a better use for that money right now. 


I’m not sure I understand the tax implications of cashing out instead of rolling it into my new 401k or a Roth IRA. I was reading the terms and it said it could be taxed up to 20%. The Special Tax notice also said there would be a 10% additional tax on early distribution - which I assume this would be that. So that’s 30% tax on $5144 leaves me with roughly $3600. That covers my high interest loan and leftover for another debt or savings. But that’s such a high tax still, can’t decide if it’s worth it., yet the feeling of immediate debt relief seems pretty attractive.

personalfinance,"22 with $27k, leaving the US for undetermined amount of time in less than 4 weeks, no idea what to do","Hello :)

I have no idea what to do with my money. I have read the community information, but feel this situation is a bit complicated. Here is my information:

$9,XXX in a savings account, earning about $2 per quarter

$6,5XX in a checking account

$14,5XX in Federal Student Loans through Great Lakes- 2k unsubsidized, the rest are subsidized with rates from 3.75-4.45, they are in grace until December

$2,XXX in an Edward Jones account

$10,5XX in a 529 account that will be taken out before I leave, relative is ready to write me the check

$3XX in Credit Card

$1,XXX I will make working the next month that I will probably spend

I have graduated from a state school with a fairly reputable business bachelors. I am off to (european country) on a working visa for the next year. After that I do not plan on returning to the US for some time, as I plan on traveling/ working while traveling for a few years, and eventually getting my masters degree abroad. The school I would like to go to is around $12k a year and is on the FAFSA list for international schools, so I will qualify for loans.

My main goal is paying off the 14.5k I have in student loans over the next 3-4 years working. I will be able to work all the time I am abroad, so I pretty much have $15k I  have no idea what to do with. I am so cautious about spending money, and I feel afraid to spend/ invest any of it. Because I don't know when I'll return to the US, I am leery about contributing to a Roth or a 401k. Retirement seems so far away, would I be able to access this abroad?

I was thinking about putting a few thousand in an index, but I don't have much confidence in the economy at the moment. I am really looking for something relatively low risk. I feel guilty that it is just losing value sitting in my generic bank account.

I appreciate any advice. $15k is so much money to me, I have no idea what to do with it right now. I hope I am not breaking any rules by posting this!! Thank you!!!",finance
personalfinance,How should I allocate my income for the best long-term results?,"I make USD $3,200 pre-tax monthly. After taxes and 4% to my 401K I'm seeing about $2,400 a month income.

Ripple,"New take on the cliche we always hear, an idea for a possible ""win-win"" scenario in the security-or-not discussion, and a thought on motivating factors uniting early XRP/crypto adopters","Long time lurker here. Just wanted to share what I believe is an intriguing thought, and curious if anyone else has had something similar cross their mind.

By now, the phrase, ""Only invest what you are prepared to lose"" has become so ubiquitous, it is nearly a cliche. A very wise phrase, but now very common.

It just struck me as I was looking at my new beverage glassware, that, to me, ""what I can afford to lose"" is much, much higher than most people could comfortably accept. As in, does anyone else here not like to discuss crypto with friends because they know those friends would question your sanity? And yet would you be fairly unaffected if your crypto holdings became worthless?

I put nearly all of my spare funds in XRP back in november '17. Still have a few ETH from 2016 too. If XRP is made illegal, Ill kick myself for not selling in January, but Ill stay a minimalist, and Ill survive without changing my life much. But if it hits $5... holy crap, that's life changing money.

I say ""illegal"" since thats the only status that would crush the value of XRP. In the extremely unlikely case XRP is made a security, I believe thats no big deal, over the right time-frame. Ill just sit back and wait for the dividends from Ripple to come in.

Theyre so pro-regulatory, they'd probably toss out small dividends just to remain in the good graces of the feds, and so innovative that theyd probably find a way to make it profitable for themselves. Thats one business Id love to have some securities from. And I bet a lot of other, huge, institutional players would too.

Anyway, to put in context how comfortable I am with losing a huge sum of money, I wish I could put in a picture of the glassware that inspired this post. 

That ""glassware"" is actually a few washed out wide-mouth salsa containers. Which are sitting on the scratched counter in my tiny, furniture devoid apartment, one of many factors allowing me to save/invest over 60% of each paycheck. Advantage of being raised poor I suppose. If you want to be hardcore, you do hardcore things. 

""If you aren't happy with less, youll never be happy with more"" is another cliche I believe is appropriate here.

And I still dump nearly all my remaining money into XRP on payday. 

(Now for the hedging. This is still a measured risk, so I have a small emergency fund, and I will diversify my portfolio as I get older. But til Im 30, being 99% crypto-allocated is a risk I can stomach.)

As for the motivation behind such risk-taking, does anyone else here (particularly fellow millenials,) still have a massive distrust of the finance and housing sector, or of traditional investing in general? Its part of why I like the idea of a decentralized financial structure.

Sorry for all the questions, and the wall of text. Theres not much else to do but chat while we wait for the world to find out what its missing, and I like learning about new or shared perspectives.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,About to start college - Want to learn to handle money better - Start ROTH or not?,"Hi all,

Longtime lurker here, but still personalfinance noob. 18m. Looking for some advice on my current situation. I'm turning 19 in a week and heading off to college a week after that. I have a taxed income with my summer job that I've made about 3.5k at this summer (Worked as a waiter at a country club) .

**3000$ in checkings (my general spending n such - hooked up to debit card) 2000$ in savings (emergency fund)**

I am taking out decent sized student loans (haven't yet) but will hopefully get my wealthy grandparents to help with them once it comes time to start repaying. I will probably eventually get some sort of job while away at school not first semester tho. I will be studying psychology but most likely be double majoring because its easy to double major with psych at my school.

Few ideas and questions:

1. Should I start a ROTH IRA? I'm thinking I will need that 3k for my first semester/year at school/future spending. But maybe I take 500 out of emergency fund just to *start* ROTH?
2. Also want to start something like an international fund. I wanna travel a lot more than I have, so I'm thinking I'll start putting small percent of income into a separate account with a rule that I only spend that money in foreign countries. Is this stupid or impractical?
3. Is it worth it to I transfer one if not both of my accounts to a high interest savings account. I like my local bank but interest rates are shit.
4. Should I get a credit card? Is it worth it to start building credit at my age or should I continue to only use my debit.
5. Tax return. I will almost definitely make less than 6,100$ this year, come march ill have no idea how to get back the \~700$ I have been taxed. If I start a ROTH IRA, can I still file for that tax return?
6. Kinda thinking I should track my expenses at colleges, considering every friend I talk to says they blow through an absurd amount of money each semester. Any tips here would be appreciated.

Side note: I am the first one in my extended family to have to take out student loans. My parents grew up rich and their parents grew up rich. My younger siblings and I were spoiled with a lavish childhood, but since my mom has been out of work for 2 years we have fallen on harder times (mom was high end stock trader making 150k+) . My dad (struggled choosing career path - is now somewhat successful real estate agent for redfin) tried to take out a loan for me but was rejected because his credit is so bad. My parents have been living over their head for years and consistently take from grandparents. Mom recently told me they have spent all of retirement savings. What can I do to help them? And what can I do to make sure I don't end up like them?

personalfinance,Parent Plus Loan versus Co-signer on a Discovery Loan,"I already started a thread on a related topic so you can see the context here:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/93kp96/cosigning\_an\_educational\_loan/](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/93kp96/cosigning_an_educational_loan/)

Background:

My daughter needs $21.5k/year for school.  She has 1.5k in scholarship for her freshman year.  She has a max $5500k Fed Direct Unsubsidized Loan for her freshman year.  I was also awarded up to 18k for a Fed Direct Parent PLUS Loan.

I have 30k saved for her.  But I don't want to give it to her up front because I like the idea of her taking on her own loans and being responsible for school (and knowing that she has to work hard every day because she has those loans to pay back).  In fact, that is what she wants.  But of course, I have to co-sign her private loans that she wants to be solely responsible for.  She wants to go with Discover because there are no fees and 1% back for maintaining 3.0 GPA (not sure if the no-fees part is true or not).

My initial inclination is to pass on the Parent PLUS Loan.  It's my loan.  I don't see the point in taking it out if I have 30k saved and can just pay for a big chunk of school without taking out loans.

But as I think about it more, the Discover loan is my loan as well.  In my daughter's mind, it is her loan and she needs to pay it back.  But in reality, it is just as much my loan as it is her loan.

Is there any significant benefit of the Parent PLUS loan over the Discover Loan?  Would it make more sense for me to take out the Parent PLUS Loan and make my daughter pay me back a certain amount toward the Parent PLUS Loan?    I am just not sure that the mindset is right in doing it that way.  The Discover Loan will motivate her because her credit is on the line as well.  What's the motivation if she just has to pay me back on the Parent PLUS Loan?   Just want to make sure I am not making a huge mistake by going with the Discover private school loan over the Parent PLUS Loan.",finance

litecoin,A beginner's Guide To Litecoin - The Silver To Bitcoin's Gold,"Blockchain, in simple terms means a database technology, or a distributed ledger that maintains an ever growing list of data records which are decentralised and impossible to tamper with. The data records, which may be a bitcoin transaction, smart contracts or in terms of other cryptocurrencies are combined in the form of blocks.

Hence, when a new transaction is entered, a block is added to the existing chain of records. Such an addition needs to be validated by 51% of all the nodes in the network making peer-to-peer transactions possible without the requirement of a centralised certifying authority.

There is a lot more to Blockchain than it being just a combination of decentralized transactions, and the scope is constantly increasing with the development of multiple cryptocurrencies. These range from different blockchains (Bitcoin blockchains, hyperledgers etc.) to marketplaces and cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin and multiple others.

**What is Litecoin?**

https://i.redd.it/ajn9ei3yvgd11.jpg

Litecoin is a peer-to-peer cryptocurrency and an open source, global payment network made using scrypt proof of work, and was launched on 13 October, 2011. The cryptocurrency has a market capital of more than $2 Billion as of 2017, which is 5x greater than the next largest currency, Peercoin.

The currency enables instant, almost no-cost payments to anyone in the world and has a fully decentralized system without any central authority. The digital currency is created and transferred electronically using encryption. All the transactions under Litecoin are recorded on a public ledger- blockchain, which allows payments to be verified in real-time.

Like Bitcoin, public ledger records all transactions, any new coins are created through a process known as “mining.” *The major difference between Bitcoin and Litecoin is that Litecoin is built for speed.* It allows quick transactions, making it a great choice for payment.

As of 2015, Litecoin was the second most popular cryptocurrency and third largest when it comes to market capitalization. One Litecoin was worth around $1.5 USD in 2015 whereas in late 2017 it hovered around $60-$95 USD. These coins function as an online payment system where users can transfer currency to one another without the need of an intermediary like bank.

**Who Created Litecoin?**  


Litecoin, which is a sister cryptocurrency to bitcoin; also projected as a better substitute to Bitcoin was created by Charlie Lee. Born in the West African nation of Ivory Coast, Lee completed his masters from MIT. He then worked for notable tech companies like Guidewire Software and Google.

Lee later went on to create the cryptocurrency while he was still working at Google, as an excuse to learn the Bitcoin code. At that time, creating the next Bitcoin was all the rage and he was no exception, although his first attempt- Fairbix wasn’t a success.

Less than a month after the failed release of Fairbix, Charlie Lee released Litecoin. This time around, Charlie cloned the core Bitcoin source code and made a number of adjustments which he felt were improvements on the problems faced with Bitcoin.

**Why Choose Litecoins?**

According to Charlie Lee, transactions under litecoins enjoy faster confirmation time. Where one bitcoin transaction takes about 10 minutes to process, a transaction under litecoin cryptocurrency takes just two-and-a-half minutes.

This is because a bitcoin transaction process requires confirmation from other users who have previously located the transfer on the master ledger which takes about 10 minutes. Although the odds of a transaction not being confirmed is pretty low, Litecoin eliminates this requirement entirely.

**Mining In Litecoin**

Unlike regular currencies which are regulated by Federal Reserve and specially printed, litecoins are created by an elaborate process called mining– the process of listing litecoin transactions.

The supply of litecoin is fixed, which means that ultimately, there will be only 84 million litecoins in circulation. As opposed to bitcoin, Litecoin generates a network called a block after every 2.5 minutes, which is a ledger entry of all recent Litecoin transactions around the world.

Bitcoin is built around hash cryptography which gets more complex as more transactions are added, and thus require more expensive computing power to mine. Litecoin eliminates this requirement by using an entirely different cryptography program, called **Scrypt**, where the limiting factor is memory, not processing efficiency.

The block made of transactions is verified by a mining software and made visible to any “miner” who wants to see it. Once miner verifies it, the next block enters the chain, which is a record of every Litecoin transaction, ever.

The incentive for mining is that the first person to perform mining successfully and verify the block is rewarded with 50 litecoins. These litecoins awarded, reduce with time, where it would continue at regular intervals until the 84,000,000th litecoin is mined.

Additionally, one unscrupulous miner cannot change the block, because the scam would be detected immediately by other miners which makes it impossible to spend the same litecoins twice.

**Trading In Litecoin**  


Litecoins can be easily integrated into existing applications and can be used to receive services like web development or buy goods. The cryptocurrency is fully compatible with Bitcoin API’s. The fast transaction confirmation feature makes litecoins ideal for small-sized purchases.

The cryptocurrency can be very easily purchased and sold on various exchanges using multiple currencies.

The Litecoin website has a growing list of services, merchants and providers that accept Litecoin, ranging from financial services to beauty product merchants.

**Purchasing Litecoins**  


You can buy Litecoins in the following ways:

* **Purchase directly from an exchange:** Litecoins are identified on exchanges under symbols LTC or XLT.
* **Earn litecoins via mining**: As already explained, the first person to successfully mine the block receives some litecoins as a reward. It is necessary to know that this process is slow and requires specialised equipment.
* **Payments using Litecoins**: Litecoins can be used to make payments for goods and services as it comes with little or no transaction costs.",cryptocurrency

I’m 25 years old and discovered PF the hard way...from being pretty bad with money. In college, I used high interest credit cards to pay for some basic living expenses I couldn’t afford, and then a few grad classes when I couldn’t get student loans in time (dumb, dumb, dumb). Doing this has had an negative impact on my finances to this day. At this age, I would love to have some decent savings in the bank, but can never seem to get my savings above 3k. I also feel like I have so many bills/money going out. 

Budget:

Student loan: $200 (minimum payment)
Auto loan: $200 (minumum payment)

Leftover-$360/month which I use for gifts, yearly expenses, unexpected expenses, travel, and honestly being young, dumb, and having fun with friends.

Fast forward to after I graduated in 2014, still had no idea that my parents had filed for bankruptcy, and had sort of forgotten about my Wells Fargo loan. I am making all of the payments for my other student loans on time, though. Because my parents (the cosigners) were still working their way through the process of bankruptcy, Wells Fargo, apparently, could not contact me telling me my loan was due after the grace period. It went into default/collections, but was never sold because of the bankruptcy.

Fast forward to late 2015. I'm getting curious and call about the loan. They tell me all of this, and say that the loan has been in default and it's my fault for not knowing and paying it on time. Fair. I get it. The loan was still my responsibility to take care of. Annoying but whatever. I eventually work out a $200/mo payment plan with them and am still working through that.

Then I discover this sub after I go to get a small loan for a car and am denied. I had a credit score in the 500s because of the default. Greeeaaaaaat. So I download credit karma, Mint, and manage to get a secured credit card. Got my score up to about 650. Nice.

Here is where things get REAL wonky. About two months ago, I get an email saying ""woah great job on your credit score!"" from CK. So I log on and notice that my Equifax report was showing a jump of 78 points while my Transunion stayed the same. CK was telling me that the Wells Fargo loan had been removed from my Equifax credit report. It had been a year since I pulled my credit reports from the big three so I went and did it.

The wells fargo default had been removed from Equifax and Experian, but was still showing up on my Transunion. I checked my FICO score and it had jumped up to 780! (Using Experian, from my credit card). However, everything with Transunion is still reading a score in the mid 600s.

Now when I look at the loan on Credit Karma under Transunion, it is showing that it has not been updated since April 30th, 2018. The amount due on the closed account was going down by 200 every time I made a payment previously, but has not changed since then. It is still not appearing on my Experian or Equifax reports at all. 


What happened here? Should I be expecting it to be put back on my credit report and my scores to go back down? Why hasn't Wells Fargo reported any change in balance/payments since April? Should I call and ask? Or would that notify them of the error and drop my credit scores like a rock again? Any help would be awesome, and I will provide any info I may have left out, please just ask.

Bitcoin,How was UASF relevant? Honest question.,"I still don't get how UASF was relevant in any way. I remember doing the thing - install the node software that would reject blocks that don't signal bit 1. I also remember that only a few percent of nodes did that, none of which were of any mining or economical significance.

And as far as i understand things, the net result on Aug 1 2017 would have been that these few percent of nodes would have forked off and seized up for lack of hashpower, while the larger honeybadger of Bitcoin would have continued on without caring.

How was that supposed to have any effect on the Segwit activation back then?

personalfinance,Grad student wondering if it's better to pay off loans or invest,"Hello personalfinance,

I'm a 23 year old PhD student in the US with $20k in student loans from undergrad. These loans have interest rates between 3-5% but they are all in deferment, not accumulating interest while I'm in school. My original plan was to save up $20k in a high yield savings account until I graduate in four years, and pay them all off at once, so I would be able to avoid paying any interest on the loans. But I'm wondering if this is the best course of action, since the interest rates are fairly low and I could probably get a better long term return by investing and making normal payments on the loans once I graduate. But I'm not sure if that slightly better return would be worth the stress of still being in debt. Or, should I be paying the loans off immediately as I have the money for it? My reasoning was that the deferment is like a free loan, so I might as well keep the money in my account instead of theirs for a while.

 My grad stipend is earned income, $26k per year, and tuition and healthcare are paid for by my program. My Roth IRA currently has $1500 and I've been adding just $60 per month. I have an emergency fund/saved money for loans currently at $6k, and I've been adding $330 per month which should get me to over $20k by four years from now. My only other debt is a car loan at $5800 @ 2.9%, monthly payment $190, so that will also be paid off by the time I graduate. Hopefully I will get a much better paying job after I graduate, and I would love to leave grad school with zero debt. Does my plan to save up and pay off all the loans at once make sense, or should I be investing more instead?",finance
personalfinance,"First job out of college, making 3 times more than ever before.","Hi, I recently graduated from college for Electrical Engineering and landed my first salary job as an Application Engineer. I live in Wisconsin, but work in Illinois. I’m 24, single, don’t own any pets or have any dependents, and haven’t really thought about anything past age 30 haha.

I’ve had pretty poor role models for handling money throughout my life (both parents in debt without retirement funds), so I’m turning to you guys to help me out with a financial plan/budget/advice so I don’t make the same mistakes. 

My salary is $72,000 gross. Prior to taxes, health insurance costs $71.73/month ($860.76 per year), dental is $7.06/month ($84.72 per year). Vision is only $1.01 per month; though I opted out because I have perfect vision (let me know if it’s a good idea to spend the $12, because I can opt in again in November). 

I also have a Health Savings Account (HAS) I could put pre-tax dollars into. My health insurance deductible is $1,500, so I’m thinking it would be good to build up this account to that number.

I chose not to enroll in voluntary life insurance or accidental death and dismemberment because they are employee paid and I feel like they’re not important at my life stage (If I’m correct in that assumption, at what age do they become important?).

My employer matches dollar per dollar for up to 6% of my 401K contributions. I’m thinking it would be best to invest into a Roth since taxes are likely to be higher when I retire. I’m assuming it would be smart to contribute 6% because I’m earning free money? Should I contribute more than 6%? Would it be smarter to instead pay down my student loans instead of put money into a Roth?

After taxes I get a bi-weekly paycheck.

My necessary monthly expenses right now are:  
 $600 for food (I eat out a lot, pay for friends, and tip well)  
 $700 for rent/utilities/internet     
 $50 for cellphone  
 $100 for student loan payment (this will increase in November, see note below)  
 $150 for car insurance  
 $250 for gas   
 $100 for car maintenance  
 $10 for Photoshop CC (necessary for the nonprofit I run in my spare time):  [http://connectionthroughcompassion.org/](http://connectionthroughcompassion.org/)  
 $150 for self-growth/healing (Reiki, breathwork, workshops, festivals, etc)

Here’s what my student loans are look like:  
 $32k in federal subsidized and unsubsidized loans serviced by Nelnet.  
 $63k in private loans through Sallie Mae and Great Lakes.

My loans are all in grace period until November. At that point I plan to consolidate the 32k I have in federal loans, at which point they’ll probably be at an interest rate of \~4%.

I also plan to refinance my private loans, at which point the $63k I owe will probably have an interest rate of \~6%.

I’m very curious about what the balance should be between investing in my 401k, paying off student loans, savings account, and fun money (so I don’t burnout). I’m also interested in any and all advice you may have for me. Please let me know if you have any further questions. My first paycheck will be on 8/24, at which point I’ll update this post to reflect my take-home amount after taxes.",finance

I checked my credit score today -- 814.  Right before applying for the car loan, I remember it was 780-something.

personalfinance,"Need help regarding refinancing our home, I'm a total noob.","My husband and I both work full time, our combined income is approximately $90k per year (after taxes). Only debt is one car, loan amount is $19k. Credit scores both in the 780 area.


My husband purchased our home in 2010, for $140k (total loan ended up being approximately $149k with closing costs). Interest rate is 5.5%, our monthly payment is $1240.


We currently owe $129,500 and are looking into refinancing with a 15 year fixed rate loan and qualified for 4.0% with our local credit union, the monthly payment will be about $1300 with closing costs.


I'm leaning more towards a 30 year loan, because we hope to pay our mortgage off more aggressively while still having some flexibility. Some of the reasons behind my opinion: the company my husband works for is shady and I am encouraging him to look for a new job, which might make our income a bit unstable and a lower monthly mortgage payment would take the pressure off during that time. We are hoping to purchase an income property (for example, a two or three family unit) and are unsure if we would keep our current home or become occupants in one of the units.


Our initial plan was to just increase our monthly payment on our current mortgage to $2000 and make an additional payment each year. But a 1.5% interest difference is tempting.


I've never purchased a home before (we got married this year) and my husband didn't really look into the details when he purchased ours a few years ago.


I'm just trying to educate myself so we can make the most sound decision. In addition, looking over the pre-disclosure document, the initial cost worksheet has me confused, so I've itemized it below, hoping someone can offer insight on what some of these charges are (they are closing costs I believe).

Underwriting: $645

Appraisal: $400

Flood certification: $32

Tax service: $81

Title - closing/escrow: $550

Title - lender's title insurance: $726

Title - title fee: $495

Recording: $295

City/county tax stamps: $1019.25


Items required by lender to be paid in advance:

Prepaid interest; 30 days at $14.893151/day: $446.79


Reserves deposited with lender:

Hazard insurance; 8 months @ 33.33/mth: $266.64

Property taxes; 8 months @ 200.00/mth: $1600.00

Is there an easy excel formula or template to help me pay off my loans given that they have different interest rates? 

I know its best to pay off the one with the highest interest first but as the higher interest loan goes down below the principal of the other loan when should I start allocating a certain dollar amount or percentage of my payment towards that one?  I know the interest will be negligible as it starts to get lower but every dollar helps! 

Loan one - $3000 @ 3.15%

Loan two - $4000 @ 3.61%

Current mortgage balance is $171,576.18, monthly P&amp;I payment of $892.82.   I have 26 more years to pay off the loan, but my motivation to consider refinance is not only protection from interest rate rising, but also to have the loan paid off before I retire (at 67 years of age).

I could also contribute $300 per month extra towards paying down mortgage principal, but how much time will this additional payment reduce the time to pay off the loan (from the current 24 years)?  I'm not sure...

personalfinance,Shady mortgage lender?,"The lender we are working with for our new construction home has been doing some weird stuff the closer we've gotten to closing.

 Everything started out great in the beginning. We were trying to decide between him and another, and he ultimately won out because he could do one closing for the construction loan, then a loan mod when the house is built, saving us nearly $9k. The other lender wanted to do 2 closings at $8600 each. Keep in mind, both lenders have been used by our builder many times in the past, so they came highly recommended. 

We told him of our intentions in the beginning to put down $100k to get our mortgage payment down to what we were used to paying and he had no issues with it at that time.
Last month, he stated that we really shouldn't put ANY down and just use the land we built on as collateral (9 acres at $85k), but we could if we really wanted to. 
Now that we are about to close, he is telling us again that we shouldn't, and that if we did a down payment that puts us under $200k, our interest rate (fixed and supposedly locked in) on our loan would go up. According to him, if we go through with the loan with no down payment we'll get the lower interest rate, BUT... we can do yet another loan mod with the ""down payment"" and it would lower the payments and lock us in at the lower rate (plus put another $350 in recording fees in their pockets). This also allows him to collect his commission on the full $251k loan, instead of on $150k if we did the down payment we want.

Everybody we've talked to says it sounds like he just doesn't want to miss out on the full commission and even other lenders we've gotten advice from said it sounds a bit shady.

TLDR: Lender says we will basically be penalized for putting a large down payment by our interest rate being higher if the loan is under $200k and is hounding us to not put any down payment.",finance

They kept their situation hidden until I prodded them enough to let me in to their financial situation. They have zero assets and zero savings for retirement of otherwise. My dad is medically retired and receives Social Security (8 herniated discs and broken screws in his back from a botched 4th surgery meant to fuse all of his vertebrae together), and my mom works in retail.

I think they need a personal loan with a low interest rate to pay off at least parts of the high-interest credit card debt, or they will never see the end of payments. They can only afford to make minimum monthly payments right now.

The idea i'm considering now is to open up a personal loan in my name, pay their bills up to the price of the loan's monthly payment, and then have them pay me the price of the monthly loan payment to break even on the loan every month.

I could refi and take out $30k with a new upb of $210k and an interest rate between 4%-5% on a new 30 year loan. 

I also have 401k. I can either take a loan on it for $30k and pay interest on that but in that case,  the interest would be going to myself. My payment would be around $550ish a month for 5 years. 

I could also just withdrawal the $30k and take a 10% penalty plus pay income tax... not sure how much the income tax would come out to. This would make it so I just pay it and move on with my life with no extra monthly payments. I am 37 right now and I could raise my monthly allotment (currently I'm at 4%) to make up for it.

A little bit about our finances we currently have a lot of debt, which makes me think we should just sell and pay down our debt and move on, but I wanted to make sure I wasn't missing something.

Our current mortgage is 800$ a month and we believe we could get anywhere from 1,500 - 2000$ in rent for our place. Also, we don't have really any savings to speak of.


It would be nice to get out of a lot of this debt/ stress, but my feeling is that long term it makes more sense to use the additional money to pay down our debt and still have the house.

personalfinance,Almost 30 years old / $110K in debt / $130K base salary,"I got a late start in the workforce, getting my first real job at age 27. Before that I was a PhD student (I exited my program to join the industry). At the time I lived in a very rural eastern state with very low income. I now work in Silicon Valley, and I'm nearing 30 years old and just now getting the full picture of financial literacy. I wish they taught this shit in high-school.

Anyway, I have $110K principal student loan debt at a fixed 5.25% interest rate. I'm on a 10 year plan, making monthly payments of approximately $1226. I have no other debt, aside from minimal credit card purchases that are easily paid off (mainly to build my score). 

* My base salary is $132,600
* My yearly bonuses target 10% (taxed at 25%, I think?)
* I have approximately $130K in RSUs of which a 3rd vests each year for 3 years (taxed at 41%). I'm one year vested.
   * This is what's paying my student loans. I take out 3 months payments of my vested amount every 3 months. This seems risky to me, but so far stock has had a good return.
* My 401K is maxed out, equivalent to 14% contributions (employer matches 125% of the first 6% not exceeding $10K) -- am I going overkill here? 
   * Currently sitting on \~$25K in the 401K
* I contribute 7% (of the allotted 15%) toward my company's ESPP
   * Not sure what to do with it, or if I should keep increasing or no; it's discounted at 15% price
* After rent + expenses, I manage to save around $1200/month 
   * I have around $9K in savings, just sitting there

In previous and similar posts I caught mention of David Ramsey's book and the advice he gives. Is it really worth it (consider my age here) to sacrifice my entire 401K, ESPP, savings, RSUs, etc. to pay down my debt within 2 to 2.5 years, and then go just as aggressively into the market and savings? I am afraid those 2-2.5 years will be a risky and stressful interval of my life. Has anyone done it? Can anyone rigorously explain the pros and cons? While I want to maximize investments and grow my wealth, I also want to reduce my debt as quickly as possible.

Silicon Valley is insane COL, and it's only getting worse. I have a serious girlfriend, and we of course would like kids one day. We'd also like our own house and a yard. That will never happen here, and we also wish to move to a lower COL area in the next 5 years.",finance

I am currently working full-time at a major corporation making about $60,000 a year. My girlfriend and I recently moved in and we have a baby on the way. Together our income is about $80,000 or some more a year.  

Since I'm 22 and not 24 my parents still matter on my FAFSA which is basically the only deal breaker for me when it comes to that. Federal Aid gives me a whopping **$0 a year** because of that! Due to my parents making (combined) well over six-figures yearly it complicates the matter.

I would love to go back to school but without federal aid it's a bit difficult, if not nearly impossible with everything. Monthly bills are below.  

* Rent - $1450
* Car Payment - $475
* Internet - $65.00
* Electric - $100.00 (on average)
* Gas (car) - $180.00
* Groceries - $250-300 (for not without a little one)
* Car Insurance - $100.00 (roughly)

personalfinance,Should I pay more than the minimum on my student loans and pay them off early?,"I’ve always been told to pay off debts as soon as possible and to pay more than the minimum interest payment. This way, I would cut down the principal and not just be paying the interest forever. My friend is now telling me it’s best to just pay the minimum and use my money for something else. My situation is a bit odd though. 

Either next September (2019) or January (2020), I plan to do a TEFL program overseas that will allow me to work, go to school, and have a visa. Considering the cost of the program, the amount of money they suggest bringing to comfortably settle in, and airfare, I’m estimating I will need to save $10,000. With the work I will be doing, I’m expected to break even every month, but could make some extra money doing side jobs. I definitely won’t be making fortunes though. 

Ideally, I would like to pay off my student loans before I head overseas. I have a private loan with a balance of about $4,700 with an interest rate of 3.875%. I am still in the grace period because I just graduated, so I only have to pay the interest ($15) every month until December. After December, the payments will jump to $88 per month (if I don’t continue paying off the principal now). 

I also have a government loan with a balance of about $6,400 with a 3.76% interest rate. I am also in the grace period for this loan until November. I am not required to make payments yet, but I made a payment recently to knock down the principal and pay off the interest early. 

I do have a brokerage account, but have not invested in any stocks yet. I just needed it for a separate debit card that I could use overseas without risking all of my finances in my normal account. 

I have a comfortable amount in my savings account right now ($3,500), so I am now paying $400 every pay period (biweekly) towards my private loan so I can hopefully pay it off before my government loan payments start. I need to save money for my program, but I will not be able to afford loan payments while I am overseas. My friend still disagrees with my current method. 

Should I just pay the minimum instead, or should I continue with my current method and pay off my loans then focus of saving for my program? 

I am temporarily living with someone rent-free, but that will change once I leave for my program. Right now, I’m only paying my phone bill, the interest for my private loan (already paid car insurance in full for the year), and for things like groceries/fuel.

investing,"Low risk, highly liquid investment vehicles for the next 12-24 months?","Can anyone suggest a relatively low risk, highly liquid investment vehicle with a holding time-span of roughly 12-24 months?

As anyone with their ear to the ground in the financial markets knows, the past six months have seen the return of volatility to the markets. Investors caught their first major whiff of correction in late February and while the market quickly moved back into the green, indices have been range bound, failing to break through the highs set in late 2017 and early 2018. The Fed has made good on its promise to raise rates and is scheduled to do so twice more before year-end. Meanwhile, the yield-curve is flattening, heading towards inversion, geopolitical risk has heightened while the white house trades blows with some of the U.S.'s largest trading partners and domestically, investors face uncertainty as midterm elections approach.

All this being said, investors should remain long term bullish on the stock market. However, in the meantime, with cash reserves to spare and little value-investment opportunities (with stocks trading hundreds of times their earnings), where can an investor stash money that will still generate income at rates higher than a money market or CD, but hold less risk than equities and are still relatively liquid?

The player starts as Zero-Suit Samus with no weapons, relying only on stealth and small puzzle-solving elements to break out of her cell and recover her belongings.  Low priority upgrades are the first to be discovered (stun-pistol, power-grip and high-jump).  Greater upgrades are acquired by confronting security bosses who are using them against her.  New powers can be found in laboratories where engineers are trying to adapt her Chozo-tech with GSF-tech and Space Pirate tech.  The game's antagonist is the prison warden who turns out to be a retired GSF general harboring a grudge against Samus for (insert plot details here), and wants to eliminate her indirectly or otherwise.

personalfinance,I've just been rejected for my first credit cards several times and don't know where to go from here to build credit and reapply,"I am a youngish (&lt;25) graduate student with an income of approx 30,000 per year. I recently moved banks to Chase and tried to apply for one of their freedom cards but was denied--the guy on the other end of the phone suggested it may be my student loans. I have about 30,000 in federal loans, a mix of subsidized and unsubsidized which have not entered repayment (deferred due to continuing education) although the unsub. loans have been earning interest--he suggested a lack of payments on these could be the cause (I also have 30,000 in my parents names' for the parent plus loans--not sure if these would affect me vs. them). He then suggested I try for a small college card from e.g. BoA to build credit with a small limit and to reapply in several months, however I tried to apply for one of these online and was rejected again.

I'm worried that multiple rejections in a short time span will actually worsen my credit score (along with the inquiries to my score maybe?) and was wondering what I should do. so far it seems my credit score (which seems to be somewhere in the upper to high 600s) is primarily from a history of on time utility bill payments, as I have never been late on any of those over a few years, but I've never had a cc to otherwise build credit.

I found some similar threads on here and suggestions were usually to get a secured card, but it seems chase doesn't offer those (or if they do I can't find them). 

frankly I just want the cc for credit building and cashback, I plan to clear the balance monthly as I would with any normal purchase but of course they can't simply take my word for it. so, I am wondering how I should go about building my credit so I can finally pass one of these applications... should I simply begin repaying some of the accrued interest on my loans for now?

personalfinance,Stock benefits as an ex-pat?,"Long-time lurker here and first time poster! Quick question for someone who might be a bit more tax savvy than myself.

Long story short, I work abroad in Ireland for a multinational corporation. I have just passed my probationary period with this company and have been given the option to invest 1-10% of each paycheck in stock in the company. The scheme has a ""buy in"" period every six months, where they deduct a percentage of each paycheck for six months and then at the end of that period they take the stock price on the lower of the two dates (the start date and end date) and sell employees shares at a 15% discount on that lower price. 

The deduction percentage is based on gross income (pre-tax) but is taken out after tax (so 10% of gross income would be more than 10% of net income etc). So there's no tax relief on these deductions- really the only benefits are that it is automatically deducted from each paycheck and that employees are sold shares at a discount. 

Given that I'm a U.S. citizen and have to file taxes in both countries, I'm concerned that taxation might dig into the earnings at an unnecessarily high rate.  As far as general banking/savings are concerned, I transfer about half of my monthly earnings to my U.S. accounts due to ease of investing, better savings interest rates, and the use of credit cards for cashback bonuses. The rest of my take-home pay goes to rent/bills/etc and a small savings account with Bank of Ireland.

Should I take the company up on this stock scheme, and if so- by how much? I was thinking of maxing it out, simply to ensure that I won't be able to touch the money easily (easily tempted to spend).

As of yesterday they’re both paid off. They both have the same interest rate of ~25%. Id like to close one now that they’re paid off.


Do you guys have suggestions on which one to close?  I assume for no reason at all keeping the unlimited is better? I have no idea. Any help would be much appreciated!!

personalfinance,Should I pay off my student loans all out once or in about 7-12 months.,"Quick Info:

* Student Debt - 11k
* Loan is federal so it is tax deductable
* Interest - 4.5%
* Monthy Payments - 700- 1,200 (depends on the month)
* I put 15% of my salary into my Simple IRA account for retirement
* I also put an additional 15% of my salary into an High Interest Savings.

I currently have 11k left in student debt, I started with 30k about 2 years ago. I have saved enough money to pay if off completely today. If I pay it off I will have left 5k in savings.

Reason I ask is because I am finally looking into purchasing a home. Where I live is fairly expensive, homes are no less than 200k. So I am looking at a home expenses at around 700-1000 a month which is why I would like to pay off the loans now to not have that expense and be able to focus just on the house.

I've look at other options and more affordable places are in bad neighborhoods. I plan to rent our the other rooms as a source of income combined with my current job.

My questions is, should I do it? Or if not what would you suggest. Thank you guys.",finance
personalfinance,Looking for the best Credit Card,"My wife and I currently have a credit card that I have had since I was 17 (12 years). It is a BP Visa credit card and has a 29% interest rate. We have always paid the bills on time, have great credit scores, and they refuse to lower the interest rate.

We are looking for suggestions on a new card that we can transfer to with 0% for the first year, no foreign transaction fees, and has a low interest rate.

EDIT:  We are currently carrying a balance around $5500. We almost had it paid off, but  then our dog got really sick and needed XRays and a ton of medication and ultimately had to be put down. We did not have an emergency fund as we were paying debts off. So now we are paying this particular credit card off again. The minimum monthly payments are  around $140 and they barely touch the interest.",finance
personalfinance,Investing vs. Paying down debt,"I currently put away 10% of my income into two separate work accounts:

1% into 401K (5% match) - 1% required for match

9% into TSP (5% match) - 6% required for match

I also have a Vanguard IRA which I'm not currently contributing to.

I'm curious if there is consensus on whether it would make better sense to take the extra 3% I'm currently contributing that is not required for the match and put that towards paying down my student loan debt. Debt currently sits at $20K in Federal loans at a weighted average rate of ~4%.

Am I better off continuing to build up my TSP or would I benefit more from aggressively paying down my debt right now and then focusing on retirement accounts once it's done?

Emergency fund is fine. Only other debt is my car loan with a 2.99% rate.",finance
financialindependence,Competing Job Offers - Need Advice,"EDIT:  Just wanted to thank everyone for their advice and recommendations.  I was already strongly leaning toward accepting the new job, but I'm now convinced more than ever that it's the right move.  Sometimes it's easy to miss the forest for the trees.  I'm going to let my supervisor know that I will not be accepting their counter-offer.

This post may be better suited to r/sysadmin, but I wanted to get some perspective from the people in this sub.  Here's a quick background:  I'm 30, married, living in the Pacific Northwest (born and raised), and an I.T. professional with 8+ years of experience.

After 5 years of working for the same ownership group and management team, I never once asked for a raise or used a single day of vacation.  Instead, I used only our allotted PTO days (5 per year) during that time.  We're given only 5 paid federal holidays per year as it's essentially a 24/7 business operation that is open all but 2 days in the entire year.  For roughly half of my tenure I've been required to be on-call for emergency after-hours technical support without any additional compensation.  I never received a monthly cell phone plan stipend (after inquiring multiple times in the past) despite being required to use my personal cell phone for work purposes,  Meanwhile, co-workers in my department and other employees throughout the organization all receive a stipend for using their personal devices for business if they are not assigned a company-issued phone.    


A few years ago after shockingly losing one of my closest relatives to suicide, I was informed that the company's bereavement policy only covered immediate family members and that I would need to use my own PTO or vacation days to take that time off to be with my family and attend his funeral.  For years I consistently stayed late in the office (voluntarily) to help meet project deadlines and keep us afloat of our daily workload because we were so heavily understaffed.  I've always taken the initiative to fix issues and make improvements wherever possible, and continuously asked to undertake additional responsibilities.  I've also consistently found ways to save our organization tens of thousands of dollars per year or more in software licensing, training, and hardware procurement costs.  While my skills, abilities and job duties have significantly increased over the last two and a half years, I've only received a single 3% cost-of-living salary increase during that time (one year ago).  I've essentially assumed the role of a System Administrator during this span, but my title has remained Desktop Support Technician along with the much lesser salary (and job requirements) that come with it.  I've been extremely flexible with my time and schedule and have traveled anywhere (we have 12 locations throughout the Pacific Northwest) they have asked me to be at any time (sometimes with less than 24 hour notice), including once 3 days before Christmas where I ended up getting stuck on a highway in a blizzard.  There have been countless times where I've worked extended hours (12+) in one day (again, voluntarily) to help resolve issues, and yet if for example I had to leave 30 minutes early the following day to go to a medical appointment, my supervisor would often expect me to ""make up"" that time so that I would need to stay an additional 30 minutes the next day, completely discounting all of the extra work I had done in the previous days/weeks.  

A few weeks ago, I asked my supervisor if it would be possible to earn more pay for more work.  Not a raise and not a demand, but simply a request to receive more pay for more of my time and availability.  Weeks passed and I felt that there was no real sense of urgency or desire to make anything happen right away.  So I finally decided that enough was enough and it was time to start looking for other jobs for the first time in more than 5 years.  Within a week I received and accepted an offer at a non-profit hospital for a System Administrator position.  It comes with a $6,000 salary raise, 2 weeks of paid vacation, 11 paid federal holidays plus 1 floating holiday, and 96 hours of paid sick leave per year (I have 3 weeks paid vacation, 5 paid holidays, 0 paid sick leave, 5 PTO days).  They offer a full 5% employer match/contribution to the 403(b) company retirement plan (compared to the 3% at my current job), the health insurance premiums are $103 less per month and their annual maximum deductible is only $700 per year ($2,700 at current employer), saving me at least $3,250 annually.  I wouldn't have access to an HSA anymore, but that's alright.  The other main draw of the new job is that they're not open 24/7.  No nights, weekend or holiday support required.  I would never be on-call again and I would not be providing help desk support which I've come to grow extremely tired of.  

I told my supervisor the next day and I was very forthright and honest with him:  I was leaving, and I was leaving because I wanted (and deserved/earned) a promotion and significant raise.  I also voiced my frustration and disdain for being on-call without adequate compensation, as well as being expected to hold down the responsibilities of two jobs for the pay of one.  I stated I felt that I was grossly underpaid and he agreed.  I also mentioned the unfairness with the cell phone stipend deal and the inflexibility I'm afforded because of my additional help desk role relative to my peers that are not working in support who have no such restrictions and have much more freedom and autonomy.  He mostly agreed with that as well and apologized for not giving me the cell stipend.  They strongly expressed their desire to retain me.  After speaking with the owner, they finally provided me with a counter-offer yesterday:  a promotion to System Administrator, $10,000 base salary increase, $30/month cell phone stipend, $50 for every week I'm on-call, and a $5,000 project/performance-based annual incentive bonus.  Not including the bonus, the total compensation (including salary, benefits, monetary value of time off) are almost exactly the same and up to $5,000 more assuming I earn the bonus.  I would still be expected to provide help desk support as well.  It's certainly an improvement from what I was receiving before, but I still don't quite feel like it's adequate.  Particularly the $50/week on-call payment.  That's really not very much to potentially have to work a lot more at any time, as well as the loss of freedom and flexibility in my personal life.

I'm strongly leaning toward going to the other organization due to the more normal business operation hours, the extra time off, not having to work in a Tier 1 support role, never having to worry about being on-call or systems going down after-hours, a more affordable health plan, superior benefits, and just having a fresh start in a new environment.  It seems like the obvious choice, but I wanted to get other opinions.",finance

* Principal Balance: **$44,000**
   * Direct Unsubsidized Stafford Loan: $11,100
      * Interest Rate: 5.84%
   * Direct Subsidized Consolidation Loan: $17,600

      * Interest Rate: 6%
* Salary: **$75,000**
* Rent: **$1600 a month**

**Background:** I was a low-income, first-generation student from an underrepresented background. First attended college ten years ago and knew nothing about financial aid because I was among the first in my extended family to have ever gone to college (very highly ranked as well). Graduated, worked in low-income jobs for five years (first job out of college had a salary of around $20,000 a year. After that, worked in careers that paid salaries around $30,000 - $35,000 a year), and now have a decently paying job in an expensive city. I've been paying off my loans regularly ever since.

My family had no knowledge of the financial aid system because none of them had ever attended college. I was told growing up that I had a college fund that would pay for my education...which ended up being a complete lie that I didn't find out until it came time to start attending. I didn't really know my best options and was pushed to take loans by the financial aid office. Ironically enough, the school now pays off the entire tuition of students whose family income matched mine when I applied. The whole situation makes me kind of nauseous.

**Current situation:** I wanted to bring this to somebody's attention because I looked at my current monthly payments and I'm paying MORE in interest than I am principal. This seems crazy to me because eventually I'll end up paying more than **DOUBLE** what I borrowed. 

I'm paying almost $1,000 a month and most of that is going to interest. This is a bit terrifying.

I want to escape this debt trap as quickly and efficiently as possible, but repayment currently seems like it would take 10 years and would drain my finances immensely. It doesn't help that my family is in poverty and needs all the help from me they can get.

**Future goals:** Currently, I have a few ideas on where I would like to take my future but would love your expertise on how this may affect my goals.

* I could potentially apply to an MBA program at a top school. I am confident that I would be able to get in, but I dread the notion of having to take out more loans to pay for it. My earning potential afterwards would be incredibly high.
* Investments. Nobody in my family invests and I currently don't have any, but it seems like a good idea.
* Working at a job that pays at least six-figures. At this point, it seems necessary to do so.

Anyways, I would love for anyone to give me their expertise on how to best proceed. I just want to figure out a way to live a decent life and escape this drowning debt so that I can move forward.",finance

personalfinance,Looking for opinions on when it is a good time to start looking for a used car/get out of current car loan.,"Hi,

I currently have a car loan, long story short, my first car I owned died and had to get a replacement, the car dealership took advantage of my plight and bad/no credit young kid situation.  Hence, I was setup with a car loan with a high interest, I think it was 28% and payments around $250 for a $20,000 car.  That was back in 2012.  I have since gotten that interest reduced to a reasonable interest rate.

So, here are my numbers:

The car I have:

2009 Kia Optima

130,000 miles

Total remaining owed: $4,592

Trade in value from Kelly Blue book is $1,574

Credit score: 689  (and continuing to rise thanks to Reddit and the help of my sisters guidance!... luckily no negative marks any longer on there!  Just 2 credit cards for gas and groceries to get the score to continue to move up)

Prepared to put a down payment of as much as $3,000 as well if necessary.

Details: on the car, just got the car serviced and was told the car engine and mechanically looks great.  It has some minor bumps to the drivers side door, only one accident... not at fault.

I'm wondering if it's worth considering trading in the vehicle for either a new car payment or even a lease option (since I just go to and from work, I barely put miles on the car).

My question:

* Should I be considering this now or eventually (if so, when should I revisit?)
* Which option would best be suited?
* What would be the best price range I should be considering? (I'm interested in low mileage about 35k or lower for next vehicle)

At this point, my reasoning behind looking into a new car, is my car is at 130k, it's currently in good working condition, but I want to prepare early and get an idea of when or if I can trade it in so I can plan ahead at what I need to do to get to this stage.  I do not want to get to a repeat event that got me into the current trap I'm in with this car.  It's great that is has run with nearly no issues.  However, my car payment is at $230/mth, and at the payoff rate, it will not be paid off until early 2020, at which point the mileage will be into I would imagine 200k's.  So I am just trying to get a factor on what I need to do or can do to best avoid another ""Oh crap, I need a car today"" moment.

Any advice on this would be helpful.  Any additional questions or info feel free to ask.  I tried to be a thorough as possible to give everything one would need all in one shot, but there may be something I missed, feel free to let me know.

Thanks!!!

Edit: Thanks for all the advice, after the opinions and thoughts, I gathered it will definitely be better to continue on the path I have been going on, to make the payment and work towards paying off the car.  Once paid off... continue to save up until the car finally gives up and only then will I look into a new car or lease option, which will also allow my credit to only continue to improve along the way.  Thanks again for helping me figure out the best path moving forward in the future for the car I have and in the upcoming years.",finance

personalfinance,"My mom just bought a used 2017 car. She's worried about the monthly payments, should she pay it out?","Okay. So my mom just bought a used 2017 vehicle for $25000 before taxes, with 11.72% (ish) interest. Payments are $285 biweekly.

After bills and whatnot, she will have roughly $600 left over per month for groceries, gas and spending money. She has the money to pay it out, which would come to ~$32000 according to the dealership (money is from life insurance, my dad passed away last year).

She's wondering if she should do this or just stick to the payments. The dealership is also suggesting she stick with it for at least 3 months to help her credit (her credit is poor), and *then* pay it out. I have no experience in financing cars, and would like advice for her. Thanks!

**Edit:** Thanks everyone. My mom was more than a little miffed at the dealership (and at herself) for all of this. She's meeting them tonight after work to discuss paying it out much closer to cost ($27k, I think this covers taxes) and is taking her brother with her to make sure she doesn't just agree blindly to things.

To those telling her to return the car, she's thinking about it.

Thank you everyone for the advice.

**Second edit:** all these numbers are in Canadian dollars, btw.

**Third edit:** now the dealership is saying they put in ""etching"" in case the vehicle is stolen (which she didn't ask for, nor was it offered), and rust protection (which is covered by Ford for 5 years anyway), that they can't remove from the price or vehicle. What is this, now? To me it seems like they're just finding bullshit fees to add onto the price for her to pay out now.

**Final edit:** my mom wants to thank everyone for their advice and comments. She's a little tired from arguing on the phone all day, but she's settled on paying it out (at just over 27k) and has learned a lot from this experience.

We have looked at a possible grace period for returning the vehicle and from what I can tell in our province (Alberta) this doesn't exist. Once you sign the contract that's your soul right there, I guess. Unfortunate.",finance

personalfinance,Reducing Tax Liability For Spousal Student Loan Payoff,"Recently married, spouse wants to pay off my student loams to the tune of $160,000.  All federal, rates from 7-8.5%.  Paying $1870 monthly plus whatever else I can throw in currently. 


We are trying to reduce tax liability if spouse pays off my loans.


Spouse has a trust of ~ $400,000.  Trust has been in 6-8% returns over last few years. 


Currently have a mortgage on a $500,000 house with ~$250,000 remaining at 3.65%. (Mortgage ~$1600 per month).


1).  It seems to make sense to payoff my loans, from a cash flow perspective.  This will allow us to increase cash flow, max contributions to 401k/IRAs and invest better.  With our mortgage at as low of a rate as it is, seems like we will get better returns in the market rather than paying that off.  We will draft a post nup that I take responsibility for all mortgage payments till payoff + projected interest amount is reached to protect her since she is covering my loans.  


2).  How do we reduce tax liability?  My research says no gift tax between spouses, although we will need a form 709 for reporting.   However, education expenses are another exemption if paid directly, but I can figure out if grad school student loans qualify.  


3). Am I correct in concluding that there is no way around the trust distribution being taxed?  Even if paid directly to loans?

If I kept my contributions in the FERS system this would pay out 5% x 100K = 5K a year

**Credit and Credit Cards**
 

**Why does this matter?** 

Understanding credit is crucial to unlocking a lot of opportunities in your life. Anytime you take out a loan the first thing examined is your credit score. Higher scores mean you get better rates, more money, more forgiveness, and better rewards. Lower scores mean higher rates, higher payments, greater chances of flat out denial, and worse opportunities for rewards. You might not think it’s a big deal right now, but down the line it could cost you tens of thousands of dollars. This stuff matters! The sooner you understand it and get a good grasp on it, the better. 

**Budget**

Before embarking on any search for credit cards, you should have a firm grasp on your finances. This includes having a budget and knowing exactly where your money is coming in and going out. Budgeting is an invaluable life skill for many reasons, but is absolutely necessary for credit cards. Lack of a budget and lack of sticking to a budget are two big reasons why people get into credit card trouble! Budgeting is worthy of its own guide but many such things are already published online. A quick google search should clarify any questions you may have. 

**The Basics**

So first of all, what is credit? 
Credit refers to your ability to buy something on the promise that you will pay for it in the future. Your credit says a lot about you as a financial entity, and it is all compiled together in one score. Banks and finance companies will check your credit score to get a snapshot of how you handle debt, which means it is very important to maintain a good score. 


*What is a credit card?* 
A credit card is issued by a bank (such as Citi or Chase) in coordination with a credit card company (such as Visa/Mastercard) and guarantees that the bank in question will pay for the charge when the card is swiped (up to a certain limit). So in theory what is happening when you buy a pack of gum with a credit card is that Citi bank has actually paid for the gum, you have not (yet). The bank then tallies up the total items it has paid for and at the end of the month, you have to pay them back. If you do not pay them back on time then you have to pay a fee proportional to the amount of debt you owe, called interest. This is different than a debit card. A debit card works by automatically retrieving the money directly from your bank account when you swipe. If your money isn’t there the debit card is denied, simple as that. 

***The Number One Rule When Learning To Use Credit Cards:***

If you could not pay for the item you wish in cash or a debit card, do NOT pay for it with a credit card. 


Very often people will use credit cards thinking that they can pay them off at the end of the month, and when the time comes they realize they don’t actually have all the money they need. That’s okay, the credit company will cheerfully allow you to roll your balance over to the next month, no problem! Except now they’re charging you interest. So when you might have been short $100, next month you’ll owe $120 PLUS what you racked up on the card during that month. If you’re late again, it rolls over again, and now you owe $144 PLUS whatever you couldn’t pay for month 2 PLUS the interest on month 2 PLUS what you rack up during month 3. It adds up very quickly and this is where people spiral into a very deep hole of debt and financial ruin. 

Credit card companies make their money off of these people, this is the entire reason the business works for them (in addition to processing fees) and they can afford to do things like offer rewards. Do not ever fail to pay off the balance at the end of the month, it’s just not worth it. 

 


**Credit score**

A credit score is a number that captures how you handle debt, with the most common score being known as a FICO score (though there are others). Credit scores range from about 300-850. The higher the number, the better the score. Your credit score affects you in ways that don’t even revolve around debt, such as car insurance rates. So having a good score is always a good thing. It has been shown that your credit score serves as a predictor for future behavior, which is why it so valuable for companies when they perform risk assessments on you.

Here are the basic distributions:

300-560: Very Bad

560-650: Bad

650-700: Fair

700-750: Good

750-850: Excellent

There are a variety of factors that go into creating your credit score, but here is the gist of it: 

*Payments History - 35%*

This is how often and how well you pay off your debts. Missing payments or being late on your payments will really hurt you here. Paying everything off on time will help. Again, don’t be late on your payments. 

*Credit Usage and Credit Limit - 30%*

Having debt is actually a good thing for your credit score, even though you might not think that makes sense. Why would it be good that you’re in debt? You can be in debt for a lot of reasons, including plenty of good ones. When you buy a house you usually don’t pull out $100,000 in cash and hand it over. You go to the bank and ask them to loan you the money to pay the house, which you promise to pay back in the form of a mortgage. If they agree you’re now in debt to the bank for $100,000. That’s a good debt, because it shows you are responsible and have a stable financial life (if you’re paying it off of course). 

So showing that you can handle debt is good, but so is showing you have a high credit limit. If you have one credit card with a $100 limit, that doesn’t mean much. $100 isn’t a huge financial risk that you’re taking, so it’s not that impressive when it comes to your score. If you have 3 cards with $10,000 limits each, that’s a different story. All of a sudden you have the capability to go $30,000 in debt on a whim. The fact that you don’t do that and that you pay off your cards is a big plus! So in general, having higher credit limits is a good thing. 

With those higher limits comes increased usage though. If you have $30,000 in available credit but only ever use $100, that isn’t helpful for predicting what happens if you all of a sudden get a $100,000 loan to buy a house. You want to have high limits but you also want to make use of those lines of credit. Never ever buy things purely for the sake of using up credit, but when you have the option, using a credit card is a generally a good idea (provided you can pay it off of course). In addition, you can get rewards, which will be discussed later. 


*Length of Credit History - 15%*

How long have you had credit? The longer you’ve had credit the more trustworthy your score will be. If you’ve only had credit for a year your score might be a fluke, so it’s dropped to compensate. This is something that is almost entirely out of your control, but there are loopholes (see Authorized Payer). This is also why you should get started building credit ASAP!! The sooner you start, the higher your score will be when you actually need it for something important, like buying a house. I still have my first credit card active even though I haven’t used it for years. It’s sitting quietly in my sock drawer just building up my credit history for me. 


*New Lines of Credit - 10%*

If you all of a sudden ask for more credit, whether it is in the form of a new credit card or a loan, that represents a risk. What if you can’t handle the additional debt? Because of that risk, new lines of credit decrease your score, but only a little bit. They soon bounce back and you start having a higher score, because your new line of credit gets included into the other factors outlined above. 

*Other - 10%*

Having a variety of credit is good, it shows you’re experienced with credit and are financially responsible. So having a good mix of credit cards, loans, and other forms of credit will increase your score. This isn’t something you have to worry about actively trying to improve though, it’ll naturally get better as you start undertaking more financial responsibility. 


Credit scores cost you money to check. However, the Fair Credit Reporting Act entitles you to a free copy of your credit report (sort of a report card for your credit score) every 12 months from each of the three credit reporting agencies, Equifax, Experian and TransUnion. There are three ways to get your free annual credit reports:

1. Request them online at AnnualCreditReport.com.

2. Request them by phone at 877-322-8228.

3. Request them by filling out a form from the Federal Trade Commission and sending it to: Annual Credit Report Request Service, P.O. Box 105281, Atlanta, GA 30348-5281.

When submitting a request for a credit score, companies and individuals perform something called a hard pull. This means they get a full report of your credit report and credit score. A hard pull actually dings your score by a bit, because it indicates you’re about to take some financial risk. For that reason it’s important not to constantly apply for credit cards, even if you find great deals all the time. Apply for what you want and then wait. Do not use a spray and pray approach as that will result in a lot of hard pulls on your report and your score will drop. You should always know when a hard pull is being performed and should do your best to limit them. 

There are also soft pulls. Soft pulls do not affect your credit score and are used most commonly when a credit card company sends you an offer in the mail. Before they send you the offer and spend the money on postage they want to see if you even qualify. To do that they perform a soft pull. They can also be performed by employers when running a background check on potential employees (though sometimes they perform hard pulls without your knowledge! Watch out for that). These happen all the time without your knowledge and essentially act as brief glimpses into your credit report.


**Credit Cards**


There are a *lot* of credit cards out there. It’s easy to get lost in the sheer number and not understand the differences between them or which one(s) might be right for you. Before you can decide what credit card you want, if any, you have to understand a bit more about them. I recommend nerdwallet.com for doing research on cards, though there are other great sites too. 

*Annual Fee*

Some cards carry an annual fee. These fees vary, but in general hover around $100. A lot of rewards cards have annual fees that are greatly mitigated by the rewards being offered. Sometimes an annual fee will be waived for the first year, which means you could use that card for a year and then cancel it without paying any fee. It’s important not to forget about it though, or you could be forced to pay the fee by accident! For those starting out, building a credit history is very important, so planning on getting a card and then cancelling it after a year is generally a bad idea. There are plenty of cards that have 0 annual fee, and those should be the ones you target for your first cards if you can. 


*Credit Limit*

This is how much money you can charge to your credit card. If you hit this limit your card will get denied during future transactions. Credit limits are not set in stone. If your credit score increases after having a card for a while you can probably get that limit increased by calling your credit card company or going to their website. Paying off your balance will reset your the amount of credit available to you back to the limit on the card. 


*Minimum Balance vs Statement Balance vs Current Balance*

When you look at your credit card bill, it can be confusing as to what you actually owe and when it is due. The minimum balance is what you need to pay each month to avoid late fees. Paying only the minimum balance does mean you will pay interest on your purchases, so do not think you can get by with just paying that and everything will be fine. The statement balance is how much you owe for one billing cycle (one month). The statement balance is what you need to pay every month and what you should set your autopay to pay off if you go that route. The current balance is how much debt is outstanding on your card at that moment. It’s best to illustrate the difference between the two with an example. 


Let’s imagine you have a card with a $1000 limit and the billing cycle due on the 1st of every month. For January you use it to pay a total of $600 in purchases. Your statement balance for January is $600 and will be due usually a few weeks after the end of the billing cycle (so mid-late February). Your current balance on February 1 is also $600, with your available credit being $400 ($1000-$600) as that’s how much money you have owed on the card at the moment. On February 2nd you buy $100 in bubble gum cards. Your statement balance for January is unchanged, it’s still $600. However, your current balance is now $700 with an available credit on the card of $300. As soon as you pay off your January statement balance your current balance will drop to $100 ($700-$600), with the available credit increasing by the same amount to become $900. This is a bit confusing but the bottom line is that if you pay your statement balance on time each month you will be all set. 


*Late fees*

Late fees are just what they sound like, fees you pay for missing your payment deadline. Late fees are the most preventable fee of all because your deadline is not a surprise, you should know exactly when your payments are due. **Don’t make late payments!!!**

*Automatic payments*

You can set it up so that your credit card bill is automatically paid from your checking account every month. This eliminates worry about being late on a payment, and it is what I use. This is a bit unsettling at first as you have to trust that the system will work, but it does. To do this you must have the amount of money in your checking account necessary to pay off your bill. Here is where having a budget comes into play. It should never be a surprise how much you owe on your credit card, you can check it online anytime! After getting some experience with credit cards you should have a pretty good feel for how much you owe every month. 

You do not have to use automatic payments, you are welcome to pay cards manually each month. Just be sure you don’t forget!


*Processing Fee*

Credit cards are extremely convenient. They allow us to carry the capability for purchases of thousands of dollars all in our pocket. However, every time a credit card is swiped there is a small fee (usually 3-5%) that the credit card charges for this convenience (this adds up quickly for them though!). Retailers know that people are more likely to spend on credit than with cash both for psychological and convenience reasons, and so they almost all accept credit cards and they pay the fee themselves. Sometimes smaller mom and shops accept credit cards but tack on the fee to the customers, and even smaller businesses don’t accept credit cards at all for this very reason. In addition, blood sucking companies like Ticketmaster like to charge for the processing fee, because they can. 

*APR - Annual Percentage Rate*

APR is the percentage at which the credit card company will begin charging interest should you fail to pay off the balance each month. There are a few different types of APR. Introductory APR is the rate you get when you first open a card, and is generally lower than the normal rate so as to entice you into getting the card. If a card has 0% introductory APR that means you pay 0% interest for the length of time that APR is valid. However, the day that ends if you have outstanding debt you will be charged full interest from the time the debt started accumulating! This is usually a rude shock to people and is something that the credit card company likes to take advantage of. Purchase APR is the rate at which you will be charge should you fail to make payments on time. If you fail to make several payments in a row your purchase APR will jump to penalty APR. Penalty APR is the rate you will be charged if you’ve been failing to pay off your debts consistently. This rate is usually much higher than your normal APR and does not get lowered again until the credit card company feels comfortable enough to say you’re back on track. 

If you pay off your debts on time every month, your APR becomes virtually irrelevant. Interest is only charged when you don’t pay off your balance. On the other hand, if you fail to pay your debts then all of a sudden the APR rate is vitally important. An APR of 20% means that if you owe $100 after paying off all you can, your payment will jump to $120. This kind of math escalates extremely quickly. Oftentimes people who fall into credit card debt get to the point where they can’t even pay off the interest charges! This leads to a spiral of debt and eventually bankruptcy. 

So when comparing credit cards, I tend to ignore APR. I am extremely diligent about paying off my balance every month, so the fact that one card has a lower APR than the other is irrelevant for me. 


*Cash Advance*

You can treat your credit card as a debit card by using something called a cash advance. This allows you to draw direct cash (or a check) from your credit card, which is very handy. However, this act has staggering fees to perform, and so is almost always a bad idea. In short, avoid cash advances as a rule of thumb and try to find any other way to get cash before using it. There are a plethora of better ways to do this, and this can be discussed more in depth when you have a bit more experience with credit cards. 

*Balance Transfer*

A balance transfer is when you transfer the debt from one thing to another (such as from card A to card B). This can be useful for instances where your card A has a huge APR and your card B has a very low APR. You can also use balance transfers to place all your debt on one card to make it easier to keep track of. Balance transfers almost always carry with them a fee (usually 3-5%) so they are not as cost effective as paying off all your cards on time. For beginners, balance transfers are a sign that you might be in trouble with debt, though not always.

Balance transfers are extremely useful in instances when you have debt at a higher interest than a card might have. For instance, if you have a car loan at 7% that you can pay off in 12 months, but you have a new credit card with 0% APR for 12 months, a balance transfer makes sense. In that case you’ve shifted your debt from a 7% interest rate to a 0% interest rate! There are credit cards that have low balance transfer fees for precisely this reason. However, they have ridiculous APRs if you fail to pay off your balance before the introductory period is over! The credit card companies are counting on the chance that you’ll fall behind in your payments, and then they make a ton of money off you. Sadly this happens a lot, so these are not magic cure-alls when you get in trouble. 

*Authorized payer*

An authorized payer is someone who you give permission to use your credit card. Usually this is a spouse or members of your family. No matter who you’ve added as an authorized payer, you are the one responsible for paying the bill at the end of the month. So if your cousin is an authorized payer on your card, buys a yacht for $20,000, and then skips the country you are the one stuck with the bill. Do not give out authorized payers lightly!!

Authorized payers do allow for a bit of a loophole in your credit history. If a parent adds a child as an authorized payer, that child inherits their parent’s history for that particular card. So in instances where a parent has excellent credit (especially if they’ve never missed a payment), adding a child as an authorized payer can essentially bootstrap the child into a better credit score than they’d otherwise have. Risks in this scenario can be minimized by ensuring the child never has access to their parent’s card (cutting it up, etc), thereby eliminating a chance that their parents would suddenly have to pay massive bills if the child was irresponsible. This method is no substitute for having your own credit card, it’s just a method of providing a slight bump in credit score. Note: if the parent does not have excellent credit, ignore this method altogether. As the child in the scenario you do not want to inherit bad history!

*Rewards*

Finally, the fun stuff! As an incentive for people to choose and use their cards, credit card companies offer rewards. These can vary from things like straight cash back, to miles or points, to perks like travel insurance, lower insurance rates, or luxury lounges in airports (though there are many more!). If you’re responsible with your cards and willing to put in a little work into researching the best deals, credit card rewards provide a method of making money when spending money. As a general rule I pay for everything I possibly can on credit just so I can receive rewards. If a $100 grocery bill comes with 5% cash back, I’ve essentially saved $5 if I paid for it with my credit card! Unfortunately most rewards cards are not available unless you have good credit, and when starting out using credit cards you do not start with good credit. So realistically most cards that have any kind of reward will be out of your reach for a few years. This is another reason why starting to build credit as soon as possible is important!


*Charge cards*

Charge cards are very similar to credit cards, but they have some key differences. They often do not have spending limits, and they require you to pay off in full every month or face fees. You cannot roll over balances on charge cards from one month to the next. “Store credit cards” are usually charge cards.

In terms of your credit score: charge cards do not affect it in regards to credit limit as they have no limits. Normally more credit cards increase your credit limit, increasing your score. Charge cards do not do that. However, they can impact your score in terms of payment history and credit history. So long having long running charge cards are good for your score, and not paying them off is bad, same as a regular credit card. 

**How to get a credit card without having credit**

If you have no credit history it can be very hard to obtain your first credit card (especially without proof of income). There are two routes people take to accomplish this if they cannot get approved on their own: prepaid credit cards and co-signing with someone else.

A prepaid credit card is a sort of blend between a debit and a credit card that acts very much like a gift card. Instead of having the money pulled directly from your account (debit card), the bank still pays for your purchases (like a credit card). However, instead of paying back the bank at the end of every month you must prepay them at the beginning of the month. Essentially you’re getting a renewable gift card. Prepaid cards can come with rewards, so they do have some advantages over gift cards. Prepaid cards are also generally easy to obtain, which makes them convenient for people with no credit history. Not all prepaid cards will help you establish credit, some of them are counted and some are not. You will need to check each specific prepaid card for its ability to build your credit before you decide to get one. 

You can also try and find a co-signer. A co-signer is someone who signs their name up for your card in order to share legal responsibility for the debt. Typically a co-signer will be a parent, though not always. A co-signer helps get you approved because the credit card company can trust that if you fail to pay them back, the co-signer will. However, because of this the co-signer is at risk for your spending habits. This risk means that most people are not willing to act as co-signers unless they have great trust in the applicant. Poor debt handling by you could result in ruining someone else’s carefully built credit. 

**Final Notes**

Remember that a credit card company is like any other company, having a good relationship with them helps you. I once missed a payment because of a confusion of when it was due, and I called them up to discuss it. They saw that I had excellent payment history with them and that I was willing to pay the missed statement as well as the current balance all at once, so they forgave the missed payment and it was no trouble at all. When applying for new cards, you will either be accepted, denied, or essentially put on hold for a bit while they consider your application. It does not hurt to call and inquire about your status during these periods! Remember, be polite and respectful and doors may open that you always thought were closed.",finance
hardware,"FCC takes 'aggressive actions' for 5G spectrum auctions in 2018, 2019","U.S. regulators are pushing forward on the country's first auction for high-band spectrum, which is expected to play a significant role in the deployment of next-generation 5G technology.

At its monthly open meeting, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission unanimously voted on Aug. 2 to finalize application and bidding procedures for its upcoming auctions of the 28 GHz and 24 GHz spectrum bands. This millimeter-wave spectrum will offer wide bands, enabling operators to carry significantly more traffic at higher speeds. While most spectrum today in lower bands is available in 5 MHz to 10 MHz blocks, the high-band spectrum will be available in blocks that start at 100 MHz and go up from there.

Specifically, the public notice states the 28 GHz will be offered in two 425-MHz blocks by county, while the 24 GHz licenses will be offered in seven 100-MHz blocks by partial economic area. Bidding in the 28 GHz auction is set to begin Nov. 14. The bidding for the 24 GHz band, meanwhile, will begin immediately after the conclusion of the 28 GHz band auction.

Republican FCC Commissioner Michael O'Rielly said the adopted public notice ""puts the final few pieces in place"" and allows wireless operators to begin planning for the upcoming auctions. He noted, however, that because this is the first high-band spectrum auction in the U.S., it is difficult to know the right value for the spectrum and expressed concern the licenses could be sold too cheaply.

FCC Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel, a Democrat, said she would have liked to see more spectrum bands included in the upcoming 24 GHz auction, such as the 37 GHz, 39 GHz and 47 GHz bands. ""I think going forward we should be bold,"" she said.

Republican FCC Chairman Ajit Pai, however, noted the FCC intends to hold a single auction for the 37 GHz, 39 GHz and 47 GHz bands in 2019. Between the auctions later this year and those planned for 2019, he said the commission is bringing 5 GHz of spectrum to the commercial marketplace over the next 17 months. ""These are the kind of aggressive actions we need to take,"" he said.

To prepare for the planned auctions in 2019, the FCC unanimously adopted a further notice of proposed rulemaking to consolidate incumbent spectrum licenses in the 39 GHz band and generally move the upper 37 GHz, 39 GHz and 47 GHz band plans to 100 MHz channels in order to facilitate the auctioning of all three bands together.

In terms of 5G infrastructure, the agency also voted to adopt an order that aims to speed up the deployment of 5G equipment on utility poles. Specifically, the order imposes a ""one-touch make-ready"" regime for the vast majority of pole attachments governed by federal law. Under this framework, a single crew can perform all of the make-ready work, such as rearranging existing attachments on a utility pole, at the same time, without having to wait for the incumbent equipment owner to send out their own crew.

Additionally, the order prohibits state and local governments from blocking the deployment of telecom equipment through moratorium statutes or regulations that prevent or suspend the acceptance, processing or approval of necessary applications or permits.

O'Rielly said state and local governments ""have been on notice for decades"" that moratoria on telecom equipment applications would not be tolerated by Congress or the commission. ""While I know we'll be challenged in court, my simple reaction is 'hallelujah,'"" he said.

But Rosenworcel expressed concern with the order, citing Myrtle Beach, S.C., as an example of a town that blocks the deployment of certain telecom equipment during specific times of the year — namely hurricane season and peak tourist season. She said the FCC should not assume it knows better than local officials when it comes to what is best or safest for a town or city. Like O'Rielly, she indicated she expects the order to be challenged on legal grounds.

The FCC also voted unanimously on a number of other items, including one seeking comment on creating a Universal Service Fund pilot program to promote the use of telehealth services among low-income Americans. The FCC envisions setting aside up to $100 million in total funding for this pilot program, with each telehealth pilot project able to receive up to $5 million in funding.

In terms of broadcast, the FCC moved forward on a proceeding that begins the process of reimbursing certain low-power television, television translator and FM broadcast stations for costs incurred as a result of the commission's broadcast television spectrum incentive auction and the resulting repacking process. The agency also adopted an order establishing the requirements for a new incubator program that seeks to promote greater diversity in the broadcast industry.",technology

DETAILS

I've been paying a bit more than the minimum on them the whole time, but ran up some (some necessary, most irresponsible) credit card debt in college and right after that had my credit score too weak to get any kind of good refi options. I'm now in a much better situation:

* Credit score ranging between 688 and 711 (checked with all my credit card providers, Credit Karma, and Credit Sesame to get the full range), likely a bit higher as all of those haven't updated with my most recent (somewhat large) payments
* Credit cards: $9K balance on a 12% interest card that I'm planning to most of my bonus towards (pays out in September but I have the number now) and finish off by the end of the year. 
* Auto loan with $4k left on it (8.5% rate - I know I can get this down, which I'll be doing separately, but when I bought the car it was the best I could do)
* About $400 on a 0% financing on a Tuft and Needle mattress through Affirm, which I'll pay off in 3 months max.
* 3 month emergency fund and a stable, good paying job in an industry I'm confident I could find a new job in barring an absolute economic disaster

In terms of student loans, here's my (approximate) status (I can't figure out what type of repayment I'm in exactly, as apparently not all of them are on the same plan and that breaks the site's ability to show me my repayment plan type, but I'm 99% sure it's some form of IBR except for a single loan):

Loan Type | Interest Rate | Balance
---|---|----
Direct Subsidized Stafford | 6.55% | $7000
Direct Unsubsidized Stafford | 6.55% | $10000
Direct Student Plus | 7.65% | $21000

Direct Subsidized Stafford | 4.25% | $2500
Direct Unsubsidized Stafford | 6.55% | $2000
Federal Stafford Loan | 5.35% | $1,500

The Direct Student Plus loans are clearly the best opportunity, but I'm somewhat wary of losing the federal protections by refinancing them privately, particularly the large ones.

Today I was introduced to the concept of loans for debt consolidation. I have ~$10k in CC debt over a few cards with high APRs from being quite stupid when I was younger and am only paying the minimum payments for each. There really isn’t any room to up my payments each month while also paying off my car and student loans, on top of my monthly expenses. I’ve also fixed my ways and cut those cards up so if getting a loan were to happen the temptation and desire is no longer there to spend what I don’t have 

Today I checked how long it would take me to repay my highest balanced cc ($4k) at that rate and it was 19 years with $12k in interest (this isn’t counting my other three cards with equally high APRs). The interest I’d be paying back is more than the balances themselves. The monthly payment for a consolidation loan ends up being about what I pay now in minimum payments over 3 years (compared to 19 it’s soooo tantalizing)

I did some research on personal loans and their interest rates and what I’d pay in interest is so low compared to what I’m paying now. 

So here’s my question: is getting a personal loan to pay off these debts too good to be true? I’ve been reading a lot of mixed opinions due to misunderstandings of terms. And where is the best place to get this from? (A bank, credit union, the companies credit karma checked to see if I prequalified for, etc).

BlockChain,How Blockchain Will Play a Significant Role in the Mitigation of Greenhouse Gases,"In November of 2017, US federal agencies have concluded in their [report](https://science2017.globalchange.gov/) that human activity is directly linked to the increase of earth’s temperature and extreme weather events. This sets a huge challenge for governments and businesses to reduce their energy consumption and minimize the release of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere while maintaining growth. One method economists have come up with for limiting unavoidable carbon emissions is called Carbon Offsetting; and Blockchain technology just might be the perfect candidate for accelerating this procedure and making it much more practical, transparent and cost-effective.

Carbon offset is the process of converting emission reductions into tradable permits allowing emissions to become commodities. These permits can then be sold to other organizations, businesses or even individuals that are compelled by legislation or just simply wish to ‘offset’ their carbon dioxide emissions. In theory one activity offsets the other, but in practice it’s very hard to guarantee that emissions are actually being cut down in a project. Therefore, better systems are needed for avoiding manipulation and fraud in recording energy reduction and carbon footprints. And that’s where blockchains come in handy.

The Malaysian-based blockchain start-up, BESC, short for Blockchain Energy Savings Consortium, is developing a decentralized platform for tracking energy savings and tokenizing carbon credits. They are planning on deploying two blockchains, one is public and the other is private using NEM. It’s one of the few enterprise solutions that can be applied to utilize the decentralization capabilities that blockchains offer while providing necessary privacy and security in data storage.

Private blockchains are usually used in Business-to-Business (B2B) interactions. In the case of BESC, it is used to record energy savings of a given project. These savings are the product of an Energy Performance Contract (EPC) between the project developers and an energy service company (ESCO). EPC’s were nearly impossible to operate in a virtual environment, however, with the use of digital tokens and smart contracts, respective parties can now easily automate, track and validate payments. Data can then undergo an auditing procedure by carbon consultants to certify the corresponding amount of carbon credits rewarded to project developers in compliance and adherence to the United Nations Framework for Climate Change Convention (UNFCCC).

Once carbon credits are generated they will be tied to a cryptocurrency called ‘EPC Token’ stored on a public blockchain which can be traded on various cryptocurrency exchanges assuring purchasers that these tokens cannot be duplicated or falsified. This business model allows investors as well as the general public to invest into energy efficiency and renewable energy projects like wind and solar. The start-up is still in its early days and seeking funding to undertake additional system development.

## Should you buy carbon credits?

When you’re puttering around the house you’re probably not thinking of melting ice caps or changes in rainfall patterns and this is a huge challenge for climate scientist. Climate change is such a massive, world-changing issue, that it’s difficult for any one of us to feel responsible. *“No raindrop blames itself for the flood”.* The answer is yes of course, but before you buy yourself some EPC tokens make sure that you’re not giving yourself a license to pollute. So you should always try to reduce your own carbon footprint first before paying someone to reduce theirs.

I'm 22 so they still look at their income. I work full time as a manager at a bank making decent money but with all my expenses I don't have anything left over to save for school on my own.

I've been maxing out my company provided 401k and outside of keeping \~5k in the bank for liquid funds I've kept the remainder invested across several funds. I'm now at the point that in the next few paychecks I would be able to obliterate the 12 loans I have remaining (I have eliminated all the ones &gt; 7% interest).

My FICO is 725 but my average age of credit is only 7 years as my student loans take up the lion's share of the credit accounts. I'm afraid if I close out all 12 of them, I'm stuck with this average age of credit for a while. The returns I've made on my investment have outpaced the interest rates on my loans, but that may change depending on the taxes when I realize them. And of course I have no illusion of this being indicative of future performance.

financialindependence,Tax Deferred Growth - is it REALLY worth it?,"I’m in the early beginnings of my FIRE journey but have come up with an interesting conundrum since I’ve started researching and learning about investments and long term savings...

To keep it simple, I’ll explain my thought process and see what you guys think. 

Social Security and Medicare are a large part of where our taxes go when it is deducted from our paychecks, obviously, there is also Federal income tax that gets taken out. With the direction of society and the direction of Social Security and Medicare (less and less contributing, more and more using, I’m looking from the perspective that more Baby Boomers are retiring). 

My thought process is that 20-30-40 years from now, we can expect a higher income tax and higher SS and MC contribution (guessing). 

If we begin contributing and it’s tax deferred, we will get taxed on our earnings in the future. If income tax is higher than today’s income tax, is it really worth contributing into a tax-deferred fund?

Do you think tax rates will increase, stay the same, or decrease in the future?

What are your thoughts?",finance

personalfinance,19yo in HUGE (non-school related) debt in need of help getting out,"**tl:dr:** *I have $15k in debt and I'll be working 10-15hrs a week and having occasional art commissions. Can I find another way to get out of this hole as fast as possible?*

~~--------------------------------------------------------------------~~

When I turned 18 and got my license, I was in a good state financially. I had SSDI, I had a job with consistent hours, I was about to go to college for free, I was completely set. At the time, I thought getting a car would be a good idea! So I did the ~smartest~ thing a fresh adult could do, went down to a dealership with her pushover grandma and found a car I liked! 

$14,000 loan. Only $227/month? That's EASY!!! 
///HUGE SARCASTIC SENTENCE.

It WAS fine. Then, I got fired from my job due to my disability. I also lost my SSDI due to me not being a kid anymore. My income went from ~$700+ a month straight to 0 in 2 months.

Around that time, I also got a credit card so I could build my credit and have some emergency funds for school. I have learned a valuable lesson with this fucking piece of plastic. I'm awful with credit cards. Currently $1.8k in debt on it. After today, I'm going to give it to my grandmother to keep watch of until I get out of debt.

Speaking of getting out of debt, I'm trying to figure out how to balance this. I make ~$600/month, so I'm thinking of putting $250 for the car and $100 for the credit card. It's hard to balance all of this, seeing as I also have to pay $151 for other bills (I already took into account taking out the unnecessary stuff). My car loan is already at the lowest interest rate it can go, and my credit card is a student one so there's no interest whatsoever.

Luckily, I have my family behind my back. However, my family is also suffering from debt and bankruptcy. I work part-time around 15 hours a week, but since they raised my pay and kept me on, they've been lowering my hours. I estimate they'll have me work 10 hours a week. I also am going to college for graphic design (basically being paid to, thank god.), so I do some art commissions. I don't get those often though, so I don't rely on them.

I don't wish to become near-poverty as my family is. As soon as this debt is gone, I'll be researching how to invest and grow my finances. I just need help getting out of this rut. I dug this horrible hole and I'm not staying in it.",finance

&gt; The Federal Reserve upgraded its view of the economy this week, substituting “strong"" for “solid” in the statement that policymakers released after their latest meeting. The consensus on Wall Street calls for the central bank to raise rates twice more this year, in September and December.

&gt; Friday’s report confirms that trajectory, which would bring the benchmark rate to 2.25 to 2.5 percent by the end of the year. Although even that level is low by historical standards, the Fed’s slow but steady campaign to normalize interest rates after years near the zero bound is beginning to be felt.

personalfinance,"Loan issuer changed due date of payment after I paid, now they said payment is overdue and previous payment wasn't applied to this bill. Help! (US)","I have a federal student loan through MyFedLoan and the total is a little under $12K. Normally my payment is due the 24th of each month, and since I don't have regular income at the moment I have been using an ""Education Award"" from Americorps to repay it. However, to do this, each month I have to send in a request through Americorps, who contacts MyFedLoan, who approves it, then Americorps sends the payment. And usually this takes about 4-5 weeks before my payment is posted. 

The very beginning of July I requested my Americorps payment and I didn't want it to be late, so I contacted MyFedLoan to see if I can change the payment due date from the 24th of the month to the 28th. This way I'd have a few more days wiggle room and worst case scenario I'd use the last of my money to pay for it instead of the Ed Award. 

I never heard from them about the date change, so I emailed about two weeks later asking for an update just so I could be aware. Didn't hear anything back other than ""we received your email and will contact you in the future"" type of email. 

Luckily my payment posted on July 20. On July 21, they billed me again, stating that my payment was due the 28th. I logged into my account and my payment from the 20th was posted, but it also said I still owed another payment due the 28th. I have never been billed multiple times in a month so I contacted them again through their website. 

I am scraping by with money since I just started a new job this month and won't get paid for over a month since they do payroll monthly. I would rather resolve this issue than use the last of my money to pay for an extra bill from MyFedLoan, since I of course can't get the money back if I pay it even if the issue is resolved. July 28 rolled around and now the bill is overdue, and I have contacted them multiple times since and never heard anything back until last night. 

They said that since they changed the due date on the 21st and billed me then, my payment on the 20th did not count toward a bill and wasn't applied toward this bill due on the 28th. They said I can email them back so it's applied toward this bill now, which I of course did, but they also said in the email that my bill is past due and that they report monthly to a nationwide consumer reporting agency. So what does that mean for me and my credit score?? I contacted them so many times trying to figure this out, and I feel like they purposely changed the bill after I made the payment so I'd be forced to pay double in July or my credit would suffer. Is it possible to know what was reported? Or to somehow justify this or rectify it if it was reported to an agency? I have proof that I paid this payment before it was due, yet they just aren't counting it... I am so upset and frantic because I know this is no joke.",finance
personalfinance,3 job offers in 1 week,"So as the title says.. I have recently received 3 job offers in a relatively short span of time.  I'm not sure where else to post this thread so I'm going with PF (its more of a life advice not so much financial).  I am turning 25 soon and have my bachelors in chemical engineering and currently have about 75k in loans at decent interest rates.  I will try to be as descriptive as possible without giving out too much info about the companies and what not.  So basically I have 3 offers on the table:

1)  Government job making explosives for grenades and Rocket propelled devices.
Offer is a little under 70K a year with guaranteed raises at 1 and 2.5 years.  Good pensions and retirement. Flexible hours. Will help pay for masters.  Interesting work.  Only issues I have is ill have to move and its not exactly my desired field.

2) Alternative energy company that uses waste to make energy.
61k/year + overtime potential.  Will pay up to 5k/year towards masters.  Sustainability is a field I would love to get into but this is a basic operators position where I would work rotating 12 hour shifts doing hard physical labor in a hazardous environment.  Role was pitched to me as an incumbent role where I would learn the inns and outs of the plant through hands on experience where I would be quickly moved to engineering or management.  Also, can live at home, rent free, with parents if I choose.

3)  Pharmaceutical Serialization company.
72K after bonus.  Basically I would travel around the US and potentially foreign soils to help install the equipment and software that serializes pharmaceuticals.  Pros are I would get paid to travel (Job sites can be anywhere, typical job last 2 weeks to a few months) and hours are flexible with options to work from home.  I can live at home if I choose (rent free).  My only concern is the opportunity cost of not taking something more chem. eng. related to help further my career.  This job is definitely an engineers role but more mechE or electrical engineering/project management.

I feel like I'm trying to compare an apple to an orange to a pear...  Basically do I take a job in my dream field at the ground level working my ass off in less than ideal conditions for 12 hours a day, do i take the job that lets me travel and meet cool people and see cool places or do i take a very stable job in a related field with great benefits?

personalfinance,How to evaluate the true cost of a loan?,"Hey guys. Long time lurker, first time poster. I have more of a hypothetical question today. It doesn't as much pertain to me, but maybe this could shed some insight to someone in this situation, and I'm curious as to how you guys think about this. 

So obviously as I would say we all know, you ""should"" pay off loans with the highest interest rate first. I was thinking about it, how do you guys value this principle when it comes to something like an auto loan?

For instance, say you have a 30k dollar car loan at 3.5%, and 30k dollars in student loans at 6.5%. Knowing that your car is depreciating every single day, do you guys put any weight on that when considering which loan you'd attack first? Paying off the car loan first, or would you still attack the student loan first? 

I might be crazy, but I could see trying to knock the car loan at first because a student loan can never really be ""underwater"". 

Any thoughts on this?

personalfinance,Withdrawing Roth IRA early -- Is it worth it?,"Hi all, I started a Roth IRA a few years ago and basically forget about until the yearly $100 bill comes due. When I pay it, I also try to put in another 100-200, depending on what I can afford. I called the broker today to see what the tax implications would be to take it out early. (It's nowhere near finished.. I'm in my mid-30s and the penalty for early withdrawal would last until I'm 59.)

What I do know: I currently have just over $9K in it now. There is a 10% early withdrawal penalty, meaning the bank would get $900. It earns roughly $78 per year. This isn't worth it if I'm paying $100 per year. 

What I don't know: What the added tax penalty would be. I can't seem to find a good source. Obviously the state (MD) and feds would take out taxes, but I'm trying to figure out how much. 

Basically, would I earn more taking it out now, even with the tax implications (since I'm losing money on it anyway) or is it better to just wait. TIA!",finance
personalfinance,I'm a PhD student who can't work extra due to fellowship requirements and can't take out a student loan. How do I bring in more money?,"So here's my situation:

I am a PhD student at a state university. I am also fortunate to receive a fellowship that covers the cost of tuition and gives me a nice stipend during the semester (after taxes, I bring home about $1400 USD per month). This is fine, it covers rent and most of my expenses. Rent and utilities are fairly high, around $850 per month. After other bills, food, insurance, (and a little beer, I'm a PhD student and need it) I've basically used up all of my monthly stipend, and often have to dip into my very small savings ($1200). It would be nice to be able to earn some extra money somewhere, or even take out a student loan, just in case of an emergency and to avoid the ""just scraping by feeling"". Also, I would like to buy an engagement ring for my SO in the hopefully near future as well. 

Here's the kicker: my fellowship (and graduate school at my University) are quite restrictive, and state that since I receive full tuition and a stipend, I cannot work an additional job to earn extra money. My advisor told me a story about one of his students who worked on the side at a consulting firm a few years back and ended up losing all of his funding. That would be awful. 

Here's the kicker part 2: I've tried taking out federal student loans that are unsubsidized through the University (and have a fairly low interest rate). I'm only $4,000 in debt from my undergrad, so taking out a loan of about the same size wouldn't kill me. However, after speaking with the University's financial aid counselors, they say that I MAKE TOO MUCH MONEY through my stipend and tuition to take out student loans. This is because with recent policy and administration changes in the federal government, my tuition is now considered as part of my income. The University budgets approximately $31,000 to students per year, and the money that I make from my stipend combined with the money I ""make"" from my tuition pushes me just past the budgeted $31,000. To clarify: if you earn less than the $31,000 per year, the University lets you take out the student loans. If you make over the $31,000 per year, you can't unless you bullshit a budget appeal to the University with hopes that they might grant you some extra money for a student loan. 

I feel like I'm stuck. I can't earn more money by working, and I can't bring in any more money from a student loan. So what's next? I have started a monthly budget in Excel, but my projected costs still only leave me about $100 in the green at the end of the month. Is there someone at my University (other than the financial aid counselors) that I can talk to? Am I doomed to take out a personal loan from my bank that has a ridiculously high interest rate? Should I sell my childhood Lego Starwars collection (please say no)? 

Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks for your time!

personalfinance,Keep Renting or Sell Condo,"Hi there. I am trying to decide whether to keep or sell a rental property. To summarize my info:

\- I am 41 yo.

\- Current Zillow estimate: $286K. The property is in South West Pennsylvania. 

\- [This chart shows the Zillow estimate over the years](http://vdel.me.cmu.edu/social/social/condo/propertyvalue.png). Some significant appreciation is visible (even though Zillow’s estimates can be a little off).

\- This is a condo in a desirable part of the city. There will likely be continuous demand for renting this condo.

\- I owe 95K in mortgage payments (8 years remaining on the mortgage at 3.5% annual interest rate).  

\- I last lived there continuously for 8 years until December 2015. So, if I want to avoid any capital gain taxes, I would need to sell this property by December 2018 (will have lived in this property for 2 of the last 5 years). Can you please confirm this? 

\- After the mortgage and condo fees, I have a net cashflow of $240 per month. Some of it ends up going to a MM account for maintenance, the rest to an investment account. But at the end of the day, I call it a wash considering the property taxes, upkeep etc.

\- If I were to sell it, I would invest the entire proceedings into a Vanguard investment account I already own. I am maxing out my retirement funds etc. 

\- The city is running for Amazon’s second HQ, and if chosen, the property values will likely go up considerably. The chances of this city being selected is slim IMO, but not zero.

\- Dealing with new tenants, getting it cleaned every year, the upkeep etc. does get tiresome at times. My wife does not want to deal with it (2 little kids) so most of it is on me. 

Does is make sense to keep this rental or sell it? If I can get through the next 8 years until the mortgage is paid off, I am looking at around $1500-1800/month cash flow after that. That sounds attractive, but the effort that goes into owning an investment house, property taxes, keeping it updated, solving tenant problems etc. is what I consider to be a PIA.

On the other hand, if I were to sell it today, I could take advantage of the interest that my investment will earn rather than waiting for 8 years before I do that. I realize the property would likely appreciate during that time, but I don’t know by how much.

Any advice on what I should do? Is it at the point that both choices are probably OK? Am I missing something big?

personalfinance,Paying off one credit card in full or partially pay two cards,"I recently received a bonus of around $6500 after tax.  I have two CC with high interest rates, both around 20%.  Would you pay one off in full or pay both half way.

personalfinance,US - Should I pay off mortgage or max out 401k?,"Hi there,
    So here's my situtation. I'm 29 years old, single father of 1. I'm about to change jobs 100k/year now 120k/year (+ 10% bonus) in a couple weeks. I recently bought a house 2 months ago and I got to thinking. I've been maxing out my 401k for a bit, but should I stop, go down to the minimum for the match (they match 6% dollar for dollar and and extra 2% because no more pension). 

My interest rate is 3.875% so if i pay an additional 2k a month I can pay it off in 8 years, that would put me at 37. 

Is 37 too late to turn up the dial on my retirement investments, I know compound interest is your best friend, so maybe not. It's just that the idea of owning my home free and clear is a very appealing proposition.

On the flip side of this, if my interest rate is low enough to just warrent paying it off in 30 years because i can beat that rate in investments, do you guys suggest maxing out your 401k all the time or a combination of 401k plus other investments?",finance
personalfinance,Thinking about downgrading car - advice?,"I'm in the process of restructuring my debt to better my situation. One of the largest monthly costs is my auto loan. I'm currently upside down on the car's value and am wondering if it would be worth trying to downgrade. Here is the current information:

**2011 Nissan Juke w/ appx 80k miles**

Loan Balance: $13,275

Interest Rate: 11.49%

Monthly Payment: $382.85

Estimated KBB trade-in: $5000-7500

There was a dealer ad on the radio this morning which led me to seek this advice. The ad mentioned that they specialize in 'putting people in a better situation' regardless of your credit and if you're upside down on your current loan. Their website had an option to value my current vehicle and gave a certificate for a cash offer. They offered $6,169.

If I am understanding this correctly, if I purchased a car at $6,169 through them my loan balance essentially wouldn't change, but my payments would change drop to appx $221 (used a financial calculator to determine monthly). Any car costing more than the offered value would add to my balance and anything less would lessen. Is this correct?

The heart of the question is whether this option, if I'm understanding it correctly, would be worth it to save $100+/month. To fall in that price range, my options for a downgrade would be an older car with more mileage. I'd owe the same amount that I do on my current car, but with cheaper payments.

Refinancing is not an option due to my poor credit. I can continue with the current payments, but I'm wondering if I should just downgrade for the sake of a lower payment.

If you've done this before, was it worth it in hindsight? Is this something worth looking into further?

Thank you!

EDIT - I neglected to mention that the deal was to put you at 0% interest (currently at 11.49%)

EDIT 2 - Thank you all for your advice. Finances have always been a battle for me and appreciate everyone's input.",finance
personalfinance,"Please explain to me, like I'm a five-year-old, how pensions work (federal employee.)","I am a 25-year old with no dependents, and I have recently accepted a position with the federal government. We are a non-appropriated agency and we do not follow the GS pay system, so many aspects of federal employment do not apply to us. One that does, however, is FERS (pension system for federal workers.)

Let me preface this by saying that I am very apprehensive about pension plans in general. Growing up, I lost my grandfather at age 59. Since he did not meet the minimum retirement age of 60 at the time he passed, instead of his projected benefit of about $14,000 per year, my grandmother to this day receives precisely $Jack Squat from his pension. 

So naturally, I put a lot of weight on my IRA and 401k for retirement having seen the darker side of pension plans. Since not many organizations outside the government use pensions anymore, I never really took the time to understand how they work. 

Right now, I am conducting retirement planning with the assumption that my investments alone must sustain my (future) family and myself in retirement, and that my pension simply won't be there. It hurts to make this assumption, but assuming that I die, decide to leave the organization, get fired, or are strategically RIF'ed, I think it's not a far-fetched assumption. 

Is this reasonable, or can realistically count on FERS as a source of retirement income?",finance
personalfinance,Parents are offering to pass business losses through to me to bring my EFC down. Bad idea?,"I am a 24 year old undergrad (late I know). As a result, even though my parents technically are helping me go through college, FAFSA only considered my own 2016 income (when I was working fulltime). However, since then, I have had to pay for school, rent, everything else myself, and do not have much money left. Also, during 2016 I was living in the SF bay area, so unsurprisingly, I was unable to save up any money due to the high rents. Due to my ""independence"", my EFC went up around 6k, resulting in a disproportionate 9k decrease in workstudy/federal grants. This, combined with the expiration of the perkins loan means college is about to get a lot more expensive for me for the next couple years. As a result, my parents are offering to pass through some of their business losses in order to bring my EFC a bit further down (their small business is carrying forward pretty large losses). I don't know much about this stuff, but I just wanted to figure it if somehow this is illegal/ could result in other issues down the road. They told me there's nothing wrong with this, but considering their small business has losses I'd rather not take financial/legal advice from them lol.

Edit: FWIW, I'm not comfortable with them doing this, it 1. smells fishy, and 2. I thought that maybe assuming responsibility for losses of their business would also mean if they had any debt obligations in the future I could get stuck with those as well.

Edit#2: I'm worried that maybe back when I was 18 I signed paperwork saying I was an officer in the business, maybe the secretary. Currently trying to figure it out.

personalfinance,"First Salaried Job, High Interest Debt, Need Advice","I’m 25 years old. I started a new job (my first salaried job) 5 weeks ago as a software developer. My salary is $65k a year with a 5-10% end-of-year bonus, which the company has stated has rarely exceeded 7%. I expect my salary in this field will steadily increase in the long run. I am looking for advice on how to handle this money.

I am very fortunate to live in my mother’s house alone, rent-free, while she lives with her boyfriend in another house. I do not currently have to pay for utilities, internet, or phone service. My only living expenses are gas for my beat up Honda Civic (my parents cover the car insurance) and food.

I have a decent amount of debt but nothing unmanageable, and I know this debt should be my primary focus right now. I have $5839 in credit card debt on one card with a current adjustable rate APR of 21.55% and a maximum limit of $6000. I went to a computer programming school which saddled me with a loan with a current balance of $25,191 at 10.49% interest and a monthly payment $621 (interest not tax-deductible). I have deferred this loan for the maximum amount of time, 6 months, but I am keeping up with the payments now. My federal student loan for my BA in economics has a balance of $2,588 at a 3.4% interest rate and a minimum monthly payment of ~$77.

I understand that the loan for programming school was quite large, but I wouldn’t have the job I have now without it. I’m happy with the decision I made. My credit card spending was reckless during my time in that school because I had no source of income.

I have enrolled in benefits offered by my employer other than a 401k. My employer matches $0.50 on the dollar up to 6% of my own contribution to a 401k after 1 year of employment, so I will probably be looking to other options until they start matching. Before factoring in benefits, I am taking home ~$1900 post-tax every 2 weeks.

My parents have kept me afloat and will continue to do so, but I would like to stop relying on them to pay any of my expenses and hopefully pay them back a decent amount for what they have done for me.

I know meeting my minimum payments on my debts is the most important thing for me to consider right now. I know my credit card balance has to reach zero as soon as possible because the interest rate on that card is obscene. I am asking for advice on the best approach to paying down that credit card and what to do with what is left over.

I'm 22, turning 23 in December. When I was 18 I broke the lease at the first place I ever moved into because my mother got very sick and she needed someone to help her with day to day things. I got a job selling cellphones and found out that I was very good at it and starting making enough money to finance a car w/ a very high interest rate. My mother got better but being the stupid teenager I was I decided to quit my high paying job and take the car across the country, call it Wanderlust.

In a week I drove to California from Florida where I was born and raised and sat on the beach staring out at the Pacific Ocean kinda just wondering now what. I called a buddy I met during the time I spent at my first apartment and he agreed to let me come and stay on his beanbag and to look for a place with me. I was confident in my ability to find a job because of my excellent inter-personal skills. It didn't turn out well, I was unable to find a job in the time frame that he was looking to move into another place so he kicked me out. 

I met my then girlfriend at this same time and she was in sorta the same position as I was but she had a place to live so I moved in with her got my shit straight, got a job selling cars and was able to sign not one but two separate year-long leases with both of being on the lease. Well she cheated on me, and I was forced to move back in with my parents. At this current moment I make just a little over minimum wage with tips at the Subway that is close enough to walk to and from everyday, working about 35 hours a week. I have 0 savings, no experience in any field that isn't sales, no car, my stepdad is charging me rent and I feel stuck.



As far as debt is concerned I have no credit card debt, but various medical bills, around 12k owed on that first car I mentioned earlier, and another 12k owed on the lease that I broke when I was 18. I feel kinda stuck right now because my stepdad is charging me rent and I only make about a little over a grand a month. 

I know I am capable of getting a better job but I have no transportation to get there and I live in a city in Florida where public transportation isn't an option. My question is what should my first steps be? I am saving every penny I get but I don't wanna be here forever, and it feels like that's what's going to happen. I have no friends, and sometimes I just feel so alone and helpless. I fucked up my life by not preparing for her to cheat on me, and that is a really crappy feeling.

crypto_currency,Distributed Credit Chain !!,"With the development of modern information and computer technologies, more and more people around the area begin to use their capabilities. Banking and financial activities have long and firmly associated with them. First computers helped to calculate and encrypt data, now you can play on the stock exchange or manage your personal finances without leaving home. And the technology of blocking and crypto currency has opened up new financial opportunities for the average user. It was about these opportunities that Korean developers first of all thought about when they created their project - DCC (""Distributed Credit Chain"", which translates as ""Distributed Credit Network""). Their slogan is ""Making financial opportunities easier, we increase incomes!"".

The project is based on a distributed, decentralized financial network created for a variety of financial institutions that can improve their payment instruments through blocking technology, transform money transactions and realize the profitability of real financial investments.

Most importantly, according to DCC developers, in the modern financial world, large banking monopolies control banking transactions and transactions, from which they receive commission fees, and, taking advantage of their position on the market, increase the interest on loans, while reducing the profitability of deposits. They find it difficult to get rid of such questions as:

costs - part of the borrowers to whom the loan is issued can not return it, so to maintain profitability, the bank raises the interest rate for other ""trustworthy"" borrowers. This is beneficial to the bank, but not to people;

economic efficiency - it is not always possible to accurately establish the borrower's solvency, and the bank may take a long time to collect information about your solvency;

How does it work.

speculation - because of high rates, financial institutions are easier to issue loans than to open deposits. This is effective for centralized banking, but it is not profitable for deposit holders, including because of low interest;

The designated project DCC is designed to solve by entering the following objects:

Expanding the number of borrowers - interested parties select a service provider through a block account and create a request for a loan;

Data providers - combine personal information and store it in the network block, manage this data;

Providers of computer services - will help to extract information from stored data, make financial decisions based on them, highlight the main characteristics;

Responding to the credit history - credit history reports will be promptly generated by the network of lock-ups, which will allow borrowers to reduce waiting time;

Financing - banks and financial institutions are not directly involved in lending;

Institutions for risk assessment - assist in the management of the credit business, help resolve issues of collecting money from debtors;

Additional advantages:

the destruction of monopolies - the revenues from financial services should not be received by monopolies, but only by participants in the financial block of the network;

decentralization - this will help create a new model of banking services, much different from the existing one;

the transformation of business relations - it is them that will primarily affect the transition to the blockbuster. The traditional structure in the form of a tree will turn into a kind of spider web - without a rigid vertical or steering center;

state regulation - will preserve the generally accepted norms of activity and legality of transactions, help to analyze possible risks.

The DCC project allows to cover such areas of banking activity as:

Loan registration service;

Customer credit;

Control of expenses;

Credit card with Blockchain technology;

Token Loan Service;

Registration of claims for mortgage loans;

Asset Allocation ABS;

The project DCC began its work in September 2017 with the design and launch of the test version. In 2018, an open platform was launched with access to all comers, agreements were concluded with five financial institutions for conducting lending activities in the network using blocking technology. By the end of this year, the project is planned to be launched into the lending market in Indonesia. In 2019, the Vietnamese region is planned to exit, and by 2020 - the global launch of the project.

The main representatives of the DCC team: Stewie Zhu (Stewie Zhu) - Ph.D., founder of TN Tech; Stone Shi - Former Vice President of JP Morgan Chase; Dr. Daniel Lu - Ph.D. in Mathematics, Yale University.

The project cooperates with such exchanges as: Bibox, KuCoin, FCOIN, [Dex.top](https://dex.top/).

As you can see, while this project is developing the eastern economic markets, will it manage to reach the world level - let's see if so, then DCC really deserves your attention.

Bitcoin,Trappt not Bakkd?,"Bakkt is a centralized third-party AML/KYC nightmare that if successful will gain custody of a huge number of bitcoins and their corresponding private keys. Those keys might not ever be relinquished. I am curious to know who and how Bakkt will be audited and how customer accounts will be balanced with the underlying BTC. Will retail investors be allowed to withdraw their bitcoins to their personal wallets?

To draw a parallel, central banks and bullion banks control a large percentage of the world's physical bullion with many of the individual underlying gold bars having paper claims on them by multiple owners. Many analysts argue that such centralization prevents true price discovery of the underlying assets to the benefit of the custodians and at the expense of the little guy. See [here for the gold story](https://goldiraguide.org/is-bitcoin-the-answer-to-the-gold-rehypothecation-problem/) and [here](https://www.caseyresearch.com/abcs-re-hypothecation-gold-and-securities-markets-what-you-need-know/)which explains how securities re-hypothecation brought down MF Global and their customers. 

Another analogy would be how the amount of money in retail bank customers' accounts is far greater than the amount of asset value held by the bank. This fractional reserve banking is what necessitated the trillions of dollars worth of QE bailouts by the Fed and other central banks when the real estate market collapsed in 2008.

These two paragraphs from the recent [Forbes article](http://fortune.com/longform/nyse-owner-bitcoin-exchange-startup/) sum up the issue nicely:

&gt;Sprecher’s plan for bringing crypto to the masses runs contrary to what Bitcoin supporters typically champion. The purists favor Bitcoin’s “distributed” architecture, and adamantly oppose putting a big exchange at the center of the both the Bitcoin investment and payments systems. “A regulated exchange with a custodian in the middle contradicts the basic idea of Bitcoin,” says Abhishek Punia, a crypto-currency analyst with venture capital firm Draper Associates. “Bitcoin was designed to be decentralized, without intermediaries taking fees. A regulated exchange may be popular for a short period of time, but it’s not the future. The future will be the original idea of a peer-to-peer network.”

&gt;Sprecher and Loeffler (of Bakkt) disagree, arguing that a **strong central infrastructure is precisely what’s needed**, and that ICE and its partners are the ones to supply it. The challenge is getting the banks, asset managers, and endowments to embrace Bitcoin. “Being from the exchange world, we looked at the problem differently,” says Loeffler.

The bottom line is be vigilant. This Bakkt custodian is at best a solution to a temporary scaling problem and at worst a nefarious plot by powerful and established players to gain control over a lot of bitcoin wealth. If they are successful in gaining control it could set decentralized Bitcoin adoption back by years.",cryptocurrency

She plans on taking student loans out to cover schooling and basic needs; also she has received a $10,000 inheritance from her grandmother. My girlfriend is going to use most of this money to pay for her portion of the rent during the school year, the next 10 months = $782.50 x 10 = $7,825.  


She says she wants to focus on school and does not want ""the hassle"" of worrying about rent every month. Therefore, she is writing me a check for her half of rent for the next 10 months. She told me I can do what i want with the money so as long as rent is paid in full until May.   


My question is, should I use this money to make a large payment on my student loans (while paying rent in full each month)? My thought process is the interest accumulation will be less since the principal amount will be much lower after a large payment.

personalfinance,Paying off student debt vs TSP,"32k in graduate student loans at a 5.75% paying $160 a month on Revised pay as you earn (RePAYE) plan. Currently 3 years without a missed/late payment. The current bill says that after 20 years without missed payments on a federal job the remaining balance will be forgiven.

Active duty military with 3k in Roth Thrift Savings Plan on 100% S plan (small stocks, steadily averaging &gt;10% annually).

I have budgeted aside 1k a month to go towards TSP, with the idea that in 17 years the rest of my student loans will be forgiven, or the 1k/m on the s plan can compound so greatly I can withdraw early from my TSP and eat the penalties (10% + 6 month account freeze). As well as save for 3 kids college tuition this way.

personalfinance,3 Job Offers and a Promotion in One Week . . . Time to Set Up a Plan to Get These Student Loans Paid Off,"Hey everyone! 

I have been #blessed enough to get 3 job offers and a promotion this week. I graduated college a year ago, so this has been a big deal to me, especially since I am in the creative/media field. I have decided to decline my job offers and accept my promotion at my current job. I also took up a part-time job since my new schedule allows for it. 

I have been promoted to part-time to full time. The new salary will be $51,000. I'll be working these from home, at night, so I'm keeping my new part-time gig that is 20 hours, potentially more or less depending on how things go, a week during normal business hours at $20/hour. 

While I know I'm totally not ballin, I'm feeling more positive and better about finally being able to get to paying off my student loans. I've been reading a lot about how people on this forum approach this and was looking into taking the 'avalanche' method approach. I'm looking for more specific advice on this approach, and I definitely want to try to make more than the minimum payment every month. They're all currently in forbearance, but just until the beginning of September. I am also considering refinancing the private loans, but I don't know how soon that can be after just getting a higher paying position in addition to this other job I got this week. 

Here are the specifics of my loans and financials: 

Sallie Mae Loan #1 - $20,376.33 / 12% interest

Sallie Mae Loan #2 - $17,729.11 / 9.875% interest

Sallie Mae Loan #3 - $15,181.28 / 7.5% interest

Sallie Mae Loan #4 - $7,138.01 / 10.000% interest

Sallie Mae Loan #5 - $7,103.74 / 8.875% interest


I have federal loans as well that total to $35,953.10. I'm currently in a 10-year income-driven repayment plan where my current monthly payment is $73. In a year's time, it will go up to $367/month. I'm assuming that's going to be higher now that my income has more than doubled, but feel free to let me know if I'm incorrect on that since I really don't know much about this stuff regarding federal loans or the other plans I can choose from that better fit my financial situation. 

I'm about to move soon, in which my highest possible rent is going to be around $850 (I live with roommates in NYC). Monthly utilities are around $50. A credit card payment of about $60/month (this is not the minimum). At max, my monthly transportation costs will be $121 with the MTA monthly pass (even that might be ruled out since I don't need to be commuting to work every day now). 

Those are really the only major spendings I have in a month. Groceries vary month to month, but I know how to eat on a budget since that's been my only option since starting college. I don't go out very much or spend much on clothing, entertainment, etc. I'm def willing to sacrifice that kind of stuff if that means I can get rid of this burden.",finance
personalfinance,At what levels is it ok to purchase your dream car? Budget inside,"Hi all.

**TLDR:** Make 255k gross, think I have a reasonable budget, but unsure if I should go ahead with a $1k a month Tesla Model 3 purchase.

**LONG:** A brief background on my wife and I then I will show my budget and get advice:

I am 31 and my wife is 33. I changed careers about 4 years ago to Software Development. My salary progression is as follows: First 3 months $50k, at three months $53k, 1 year anniversary $54.5k, 2 year anniversary $68.9k. The last one I never got a paycheck for because I put in my notice the next day to move to Seattle. First job in Seattle $95k, 1 year later $98.5k. Half the development staff got laid off (including me) at the end of November. I didn't start my current job until beginning of March. I will give current income after my wife's.

My wife is an Executive Assistant and has been as low as $32k but is now up $70k and has been at that salary for 2 years. That's really high for her role short of working for a really large company, which she doesn't want to do.

**My Current Gross:** $135k base, $45k bonus, \~$5k stock year one. Every year after that the bonus goes down and RSU vesting gets higher.

**Wife Gross:** $70k

**Total:** \~$255k

For 2017 we were hit with a $6k tax bill so we are now filing jointly withhold at higher single rate. She takes out $364 each paycheck (bimonthly) and I take out $200 a month to reduce our taxable income. Since we both started working in March (she quit her job in December due to a abusive boss) we are trying to get up to $18k 401k so our take home is lower than it would be for most people. I also pay for a PPO at around $300 a month and do $83 a month for FSA. I am in Washington state so there is no state tax.

**Total Take Home**: $11,296

Below are the expenses in table format with the expense to the left and comments to the right. Keep in mind this will be August's budget and I will not below what changes or varies month to month. This will account for everything.

|Auto Payment|$259|2013 Nissan Leaf financed at $8k. Owe just around $5k. 2 years remaining.|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Restaurants|$140|This is a problem area for us. We unfortunate spend too much here|
|Mortgage|$2,799|Includes PMI, Principle and Interest, Property Taxes,  Home Owner's Insurance. Bought a year ago for $450k. Put 5.5% down. Redfin and Zillow estimate value at $560k|
|Pet Home Visits|$238|We both work over an hour from the house so are gone from the house 10+ hours a day minimum. Lady lets dogs out to go potty and play. $18 per day|
|Pet Food &amp; Supplies|$280|Down to one dog. Figure we have just a few months with him so we are giving him special dog food.|
|Pet Insurance|$80|This is essential. When I had two dogs I was regularly spending $1,500 a month on vet expenses and medication. Now I am down to 1 but he is still about $1k a month that we get reimbursed 90%|
|Veterinary|$150|Typically this is way over $150 but pet insurance pays back 90% so it gets close to it|
|Auto Insurance|$144|Covers two cars|

**Total Expenses for August**: $6,667

**Net Income For August**: $4,629

Remember that we are each contributing enough to get our 401k to $18k by end of December. My wife's paycheck has about 35% and mine is about 15%. I know we make too much for a Roth IRA and we can totally do a backdoor Roth but I want to save a little in our savings to cover for the couple months of unemployment.

So the Tesla would be about $1k a month for 5 years. I already have the charger at home for my Nissan Leaf so that wouldn't cost anything. I would be getting rid of a Nissan Versa which I don't think we would get much trading in; it has rust from living in Cleveland and in general isn't in the best shape but runs great.

Why do I want one? I love electric vehicles and want to keep going with that. The Leaf is great but is lagging behind technologically heavily. And the biggest reason I want a Tesla, besides electric, is the autopilot features that constantly get updated. I test drove a Model 3 yesterday and it was incredible. Even while holding my hands on the wheel the whole time I couldn't believe it was happening. So in essence, the model 3 is not at all a must and more of a splurge. The advantage of doing it now is that I would get the $7,500 federal tax credit.

My gut says the posters here won't be a fan but I was curious anyways since I tend to be more negative. Was wondering if I was being too pessimistic.",finance

investing,"DFAST and CCAR, governance, risk management and internal controls","+ **https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/regulatory/articles/ccar-and-dfast-insights.html**

The Federal Reserve (Fed) released the results of its Dodd-Frank Act Stress Tests (DFAST) on June 21, 2018, and the results of the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) on June 28, 2018. In response, Deloitte Risk and Financial Advisory has summarized key facts and takeaways and offers our view on what may be in store for large US banks.

CCAR: Key facts

+ The Fed objected to one firm, Deutsche Bank USA, on qualitative grounds, and granted conditional non-objections for three firms, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and State Street.
    
+ A record number of firms, six, adjusted their dividend or stock buy-back requests to avoid objection, the so-called mulligan, exceeding the prior record of four firms making adjustments in 2015 (see below).

+ Capital planning internal controls in many instances continue to fall below the Federal Reserve’s supervisory expectations.

=== === ===

The prior week’s release of the Dodd-Frank Act Stress Test (DFAST) results provided more detailed information on the Fed’s stress test. Compared to CCAR, those results exclude buybacks and capital issuances and hold past common dividends constant.

=== === === 

**DFAST (severely adverse scenario): Key facts**

All firms exceeded minimum required capital under stress for the fourth year in a row.


This year’s test had a higher stress impact than previous years resulting in lower post-stress minimum capital levels, reversing an improving trend. The increase in stress was evidenced by:

+ Higher loss rates on loans (6.4 percent vs 5.8 percent)

+ Higher global market shock losses (up 22 percent)

+ Lower offsetting tax benefits in loss and recovery periods from the new tax law (32bp on risk-weighted assets (RWA) on average)

+ Declines in other comprehensive income (OCI) (30 bp on RWA in aggregate)



These more stressful results were somewhat offset by lower growth in risk-weighted assets and higher pre-provision net revenue.


Impact from changes in law. In response to provisions in the recently passed regulatory relief legislation (S.2155, Economic Growth, Regulatory Reform, and Consumer Protection Act “EGRRCPA”), the Fed excluded the three firms below the $100 billion asset threshold2, and announced they would also exclude those firms from the CCAR results.


The supplementary leverage ratio was more constraining than last year. For most firms post-stress supplemental leverage ratios were closer to minimum levels than last year and all firms exceeded the minimum ratio of 3.0 percent.",finance

personalfinance,$55k in private student loans with most at 11% plus interest rates... help?,"In brief, I did not come from a high income household, and I had to take out private loans during my initial stint of college that did not go well.  Joined the military, took the old GI Bill option (bad advice in basic... should have taken the money), got out after 4 years and building up my credit and keeping payments on time, I started making a decent paycheck as a software engineer straight out for about 3 years...

Then 2017 happened.  Start up I was with went under.  Went unemployed for 8 months out of the year, blew through all my savings (23K in 401ks I had to cash out) to survive, got a contract to hire for 3 months in between, and I basically went back to school until this april during all of the down time, and finally got my bachelor's.

However, even at making $75k/year and great benefits now in software once again, I have two sets of student loans at 11% interest rate and higher through navient and what was ACS that total at about 49k, and all private (the remainder is at 4% currently in staffords).  To top that off, my boyfriend is permanently disabled... so financial support from him just can't happen.  I don't have family I talk to much and would not help me (they have said as much), and I'm looking at my options for reconsolidating my loans.  Problem is, because of my stint of unemployment and lack of assets, I can't, and the student loans are at my rent payment of $1000/month at this time.  Between this and the remainder of my bills... I'm cash strapped.  If I had six months away from payments, I could throttle the credit card debt I had to take out to survive 2017 and these folks wouldn't be a problem and I would just start overpaying one at a time like I was prior to 2017.

personalfinance,Should we increase retirement contributions or pay down mortgage?,"My wife and I just sold our first home. We bought it as a foreclosure and rehabbed it.

I have 14.5k (ish) in debt 4,2xx left on my car loan  and just under 10K left on my student loans. 
I save $150 a week making about only 500 a week currently making 15/hr but that will be going up every few month over the next few years peaking around 30/hr or so in 5 years. 
 My interest rates are 6% on car loan and 4 on my student loans. Of my $150 I set aside weekly   100 goes into my Goldman Sachs savings account which I intend to use on a multi family home and live in a unit when I finally decide to move out. The other 50 goes into my vanguard account.   

I’ve been thinking about paying minimum on my loans and maxing out (for me) my savings rate instead.  But I’m not really sure what makes more sense to do. 

I’m leaning towards saving because building the equity renting out the other units is kind of an exponential return rate and being mid 20s everything going into my Roth is huge according to what I’ve read and heard .

financialindependence,Tax gain harvesting findings,"I'm not sure how familiar everyone is with tax gain harvesting but it's something to look into if you're in the 12% or lower income tax bracket as it allows you to step up your cost basis of an investment after 1+ year of holding paper gains without paying federal capital gains tax on it. There are of course limits to it as the gains add to your income which will eventually push you to the next bracket and it can impact things like Roth conversions and qualified dividends if you sell and re-buy at the wrong time.

I read that a caveat to it is if you live in a state with capital gains taxes it will drag down the efficiency of this, since you'd be paying state capital gains taxes each year and taking away money that would otherwise be compounding until you eventually sell longer term. To a certain extent this makes sense but it doesn't give a breakeven point to the state tax rate at which it no longer makes sense to tax gain harvest (probably because it depends on variable input). I couldn't find a calculator or example showing situations when you should or shouldn't use tax gain harvesting so I decided to simulate some examples. 

Results are dependent on fed tax rate, state tax rate, investment returns, and investment duration.
Note the below assumes a 5 year investment at 10% returns on 100k and you have not filled up your 12% income bracket with the gain harvesting.

Key findings:  
Higher investment return rates correlate to a lower state tax rate needed for breakeven, but this isn't very meaningful even at unrealistic 20% annual returns (breakeven ~10% state tax vs 15% fed tax).  
At a 15% fed tax rate, 3% state tax rate, and 10% annual returns (off principle of 100k), ~5k would be saved by tax gain harvesting over 5 years.  
At a 15% fed tax rate, 5% state tax rate, and 10% annual returns (off principle of 100k), ~4k would be saved by tax gain harvesting over 5 years.  
At a 15% fed tax rate, 7% state tax rate, and 10% annual returns (off principle of 100k), ~3k would be saved by tax gain harvesting over 5 years.

[Tax gain harvesting findings](https://imgur.com/a/SSX5Fc2)

Hopefully this gives some perspective on if tax gain harvesting may benefit you. I realized that it won't be super useful to me until I build up taxable accounts and by then I likely won't be in the 12% bracket.",finance

DD inside.","Disclaimer: After reading several tips on /r/investing, and spending about three months completing research, I have built a position in Energy Fuels (UUUU), and will continue to do so. I am also looking at UEC, but I don't feel as strongly about them. A lot of this information I gathered has come from online research, as well as comments from reddit and other investing forums. It is economically clear that uranium is at the end of a prolonged bear market. 

The current spot price of uranium is near an all time low. This is largely due to a surplus of uranium and an increase in decommissioned reactors. Both of these are the result of uranium reaching the apex of its previous bubble, and the events of Fukushima. However, that has all changed over the last year, and should continue to change at a parabolic rate. [Cameco](https://business.financialpost.com/commodities/mining/cameco-indefinitely-extends-mine-and-mill-shut-down-hundreds-to-be-laid-off) has shut down their uranium mining operation indefinitely, and Kazakhstan has initiated a [20% reduction in uranium mining](http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/UF-Kazakhstan-to-cut-uranium-production-0412177.html). Additionally, Paladin Energy has [discontinued uranium mining](https://investingnews.com/daily/resource-investing/energy-investing/uranium-investing/paladin-energy-pulls-plug-langer-heinrich/) on Langer Heinrich This creates a massive decrease in supply. 

The World Nuclear Association states there are currently [50 reactors under construction](http://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/current-and-future-generation/plans-for-new-reactors-worldwide.aspx), with another 150 on order, and an additional 300 being proposed. This is approximately 160,000 MWe of power, all requiring uranium. These factors contribute to a massive increase in demand. 

[Several countries](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/06/30/world-powers-rush-build-huge-missile-laden-submarines/711058002/), including [Russia](http://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-o-s/russia-nuclear-power.aspx), [United States](http://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-t-z/usa-nuclear-power.aspx), [UK](https://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/the-royal-navy-building-nuclear-missile-submarine-could-kill-24835) [China](https://carnegieendowment.org/2018/05/14/future-of-nuclear-power-in-china-pub-76311), [France](https://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/france-building-new-nuclear-powered-submarine-here-what-it-25808) are building numerous new nuclear reactors, submarines and aircraft carriers. This is what many are calling ""the beginning of a nuclear energy race"".

Japan, who previously idled almost 60 nuclear reactors after the Fukushima incident, has [brought their nuclear energy market back to life](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kensilverstein/2017/09/08/japan-may-be-coming-full-circle-after-its-fukushima-nuclear-energy-disaster/#3d67d36430e8). Five new reactors have been brought online, and ""many more may be on their way"". Japan, like all other countries has a desperate need for nuclear energy, and they are now shifting toward increased nuclear use. 

&gt; ""One consequence of the accident was a gradual shutdown of all nuclear power plants, which has led to a significant rise in fossil fuels use, increased fuel imports and rising carbon dioxide emissions. It has also brought electricity prices to unsustainable levels,"" the International Energy Agency (IEA) reports.

At this point, I believe it is clear that the uranium market is in the beginning of a large turnaround. I evaluated several ETF's, miners and holding companies, and I believe Energy Fuels (UUUU) is the best positioned company over the next 1-5 years. They are at the beginning of a turn around. Their [recent earnings report](https://www.marketwatch.com/press-release/energy-fuels-announces-q2-2018-results-including-55-million-of-working-capital-2018-08-03) indicates,

* $55 million in working capital
* $27 million in quarterly revenue
* $7 million quarterly net

Energy Fuels has been able to innovate, cut costs, and remain cash flow positive, while maintaining the largest uranium mining operation in the United States. During the previous commodity bull run, this company traded at $200. It current trades at approx $3.50, and has almost doubled its share price and volume over the last 6 months. This is the bottom. 

The United States has launched a [Section 232 investigation](https://agmetalminer.com/2018/07/19/this-morning-in-metals-doc-launches-section-232-uranium-investigation/) in an effort to analyze security threats from massive uranium imports. 

&gt; “Our production of uranium necessary for military and electric power has dropped from 49 percent of our consumption to five percent,” Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross said in a release. “The Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security will conduct a thorough, fair, and transparent review to determine whether uranium imports threaten to impair national security.”

Currently, [less than 3%](https://www.streetwisereports.com/article/2018/04/10/top-u-s-uranium-producer-files-section-232-petition.html) of the uranium consumed in the U.S. is produced domestically. The Petition seeks a remedy which will set a quota to limit imports of uranium into the U.S., effectively reserving 25% of the U.S. nuclear market for U.S. uranium production. The petition also requests ""implementation of a requirement for U.S. federal utilities and agencies to buy U.S. uranium in accordance with the President's Buy American Policy.""

If passed, Energy Fuels stands to be the largest benefactor, as they are the best uranium mining organization in the United States. 

In addition, Energy Fuels has [resumed Vanadium production](http://www.energyfuels.com/news-pr/energy-fuels-to-resume-vanadium-production-at-its-white-mesa-mill-in-2018/), and ""expects to recover significant quantities of currently dissolved vanadium (as V2O5) from pond solutions at the Company’s White Mesa Mill"". 

&gt; Vanadium prices have risen by more than 400% over the past 24 months to about US $15 per pound V2O5.

I can continue to share my findings, but I don't want a really big wall of text. I'd like to hear comments and criticisms from people smarter than myself, which is most people. 

TLDR: The uranium market is poised for large gains over the next 1-5 years. Energy Fuels (UUUU) is considered a top buy.",finance
personalfinance,Pay down tuition or buy a 'better' beater car?,"Hi all,

I am a rising Sophomore uni student. I have around $3k that I intended on paying down tuition (I go to a state school with no financial aid) which would have me remaining in $10k over 2 semesters for private loans. I want to go to medical school so I am anticipating these loans for another 10 years before paying (I can defer residency if I go through discover). My issue is that my car will most likely not pass inspection next August as it has some hefty frame rust (got it for 2K two years ago).

My idea was to pay down the $3k which would leave me just under $1k in savings for emergencies and food as I am applying to jobs in the city and it won't be for a few weeks. I then planned on saving up another $2k-$3k by working, selling my car to the demolition derby folks, and buying another vehicle.

My parents think I should just take out the extra $3k and save more to get a better vehicle so I don't have to replace it again in another 3 years. I think if I can find one without frame rust it will last longer.

I did some calculations and if I earn a 7% interest rate through a fixed private loan with no capitalization it will cost around $9k. If I had to replace the vehicle every 3 years that's around what it would cost with inflation and taxes most likely. 

I need a vehicle for transport especially since we get terrible winters and have nonexistent public transportation systems. This is also the only year I will need to take out private loans.

personalfinance,New To The Financing World,"Hey reddit!

I'm heading off to university in a couple weeks and to be honest I have no fucking clue what financing is! My parents are divorced and either side is upper-middle class however I don't have any savings for college (which is totally cool, I personally don't feel like it's their responsibility to pay for my college since I have a lot of siblings) I pulled out all of my federal loans for college after not getting any scholarship money and pennies from my fafsa however, I have $1,960 saved from family and friends from graduating! I don't have a car (don't see the point in the expense if there's a great bus service on campus that will take me to both of my hometowns for free on the weekends)

Ever since I was little, my grandparents (step dad's parents) have promised to pay for my college (again, not their responsibility but I'll graciously accept!) however, the conditions have slightly changed throughout the years. At first it was: ""Laqueen's college is completely covered wherever she goes!!!"", then it was: ""her college will be covered as long as she passes all of her classes."" (which is no problem for me, I can study my ass off), but now it's: ""Laqueen will have to take out the loans in her name and once she passes all of her classes we'll pay off her loans."" So now I'm very iffy on what to trust, they've told me not to worry about paying the loans off since they'll take care of it once I graduate but I also don't want to mess around and not pay off my debt ASAP if they don't hold up their end, but they have proven in the past to keep their word for large amounts of money like that. I'm nervous in this situation since it's my first time a sum like this is in my name and I'm afraid of getting screwed over financially early in my life.

My parents have given me totally opposite advice on what to do with my graduation money, loans, and whether I should work my freshmen year. 

Dad: Put all of your grad money in a savings account, if you have a work-study job offered to you take it otherwise, take freshmen year to learn the ropes and build a good foundation for your GPA but after freshmen year you work your tail off to pay off some loans while you can in college due to interest building right off the bat.

Mom: There's no point in trying to pay off your loans in college since you'll pass your classes and the grandparents will pay it all off once you graduate. Use your graduation money however you please. Start working your sophomore year so you have some of your own money.

My dad is the frugal one, he's the parent I've lived with since they separated. My mom kinda left around the time they went bankrupt (which both parents had a fault in) but my dad was able to penny pinch throughout it all to where we could move out from our crappy one room apartment in Cali to buy a huge two story home in Texas. He would seriously budget and write down everything we bought right down to the very potato chip bag in our school lunches. He tells me not to trust any money that isn't in my hand, which I think is a little overkill since my grandparents were generous enough to buy my $4,300 tuba for me last week for college. My dad is hella sus about them but my grandparents literally have millions, I think he gets weary when it comes to situations with money since my mom wasn't very trustworthy with it.

However, my mom loves to spend money on frivolous things even when there's no money. Versace sunglasses on sale? Charge it onto the credit card! She'll buy things when they're not necessary and my mom and step dad will ask my grandparents for money when they really need something but spend the same amount of money on something so superfluous!! For example, our fridge is on its last leg, frost is everywhere in the freezer yet my step dad decided to buy $5,000 tire thingys for his hellcat and proceeded to ask his parents for money for a new fridge; claiming he didn't have any money!!!

So far I haven't done anything since I'm confused on what to do, but before I move out I will be:

* Setting up my own account and putting all $1,960 into a savings account. I'll start my first credit card in order to slowly start building up good credit score.
* Contacting friends and professors to get in touch with those who can get me in for a work-study, if the opportunity doesn't arise I can always apply again next semester.

I know my game plan isn't much but I honestly don't have a clue what to do. Should I trust my grandparents word or should I prepare to pay off my loans in full on my own? If you have any financial advice for one going into college it would be much appreciated.

Disclaimer: I understand that I am much more fortunate than most to have the financial support I have. I am in no way saying that I'm ungrateful for my resources and am asking for advice since I've never had to deal with finances as bratty as it sounds.",finance

I was contributing to a 401k through a full time job, but I couldn't afford to contribute much, so there isn't much in there, about $800. 

I left the job, so I had to close the 401k ,I couldn't keep the money in that account. I was advised to put the money right in a Roth IRA, so I planned on doing that. I could really use the money, but I was told that if I cashed it all out, I would basically lose it all to taxes and penalties. I opened a Roth IRA at my bank and the 401k folks were supposed to send the check straight to my bank to be deposited into the IRA. 

Yesterday, I received a check in the mail. I'm guessing they didn't get the message to send the check to the bank. The check was for the \~$800, less a federal tax withholding, so I was left with a little over $700. 

As I said, this money would be very useful to me right now, so what I'm wondering is: if I deposit that check into my regular checking account, is there a penalty? Or were all the taxes and penalties already taken out? I can't get a hold of customer service to ask, and I'm not sure that would help. The check stub just lists the taxes, no penalties.

Most of the info I can find online about cashing out early are talking about much larger amounts, in the thousands or more. I'm wondering if maybe the penalties just aren't as high because the amount in the account wasn't that much. I also know that saving for retirement is important, but I'm not asking if I should save the money. I know that's the best choice, but it's just not my best option at the moment.

personalfinance,(DK) Is this calculation of buying vs renting reasonable?,"Hi /r/personalfinance,

Me and my +8y partner (30y) are living in a European capital (Copenhagen) on a rented flat. We are evaluating whether we should buy a flat (assume we remain in CPH), and we came to the conclusion that we should (+1m DKK over 50 years). We base our conclusion on a spread sheet we did based on ou research with the negative profit of each option (renting vs buying).

we are a bit surprised by the amount of money we save long term by buying a flat based on our calculations. This led me to ask here for some advice on **whether our calculations are right** to you.

Spreadsheet:[buy vs rent house](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xhYzHoWEZbXxEsiV8RrTIOhIFB1QK19I3OflpxVYOKY/edit?usp=sharing)

Essentially, we are computing the (negative) profit of each option over the period of our lifetime: rent a house incurs mostly costs but the money is revenuing through investment (-7.8m DKK, E33); buying a house incurs a mortgage, monthly costs, but we revenue the house value (-6.6m DKK, B33).

Note that the ""effective interest rate"" comes from: [You get a tax discount of about 33% of the interest you pay on a mortgage per year](http://hejsonderborg.dk/buying-house-denmark/), the 2% fixed interest rate on mortgage seems to be the standard here.

Regarding the other financial part: our household makes ~1m DKK/year (before tax, ~65% after tax) and we have around 2m DKK in cash (some with interest rate at 0.1%, other at 2.5%, including all except pension funds). For a 3m DKK house, we would pay 20% of yearly bruto income for the house (currently paying 13%), and the downpayment of 20% would be covered.",finance

personalfinance,Better to invest slowly in a tax advantaged account or immediately in a taxable account?,"Or something else that I'm not thinking of?

My situation: I'm in my mid-20's. I have been very fortunate and I currently have more cash than I know what to do with sitting in the bank. I've only recently learned that the better thing to do is to invest it for retirement, so I'm trying to figure out how best to do that. I have no debt and no dependents.

Here are the numbers: I've maxed out my IRA contributions for the time being. After putting aside some money that would be used as an emergency fund, I'm still left with about $45k that I want to invest for retirement. I see two possible ways of doing this:

1. Open a taxable brokerage account and put it all in there right now, or
2. Make as much pre-tax contribution as I can to my employer's 401(k) (technically 457(b) since I'm a graduate student, which by the way does not offer any employer matching or the like), so that I have virtually no take-home pay, while living off of the excess money until I'm happy with how much I've invested. With my income I would be able to contribute roughly $2.4k/month. So if I max out my IRA contributions each year and save a bit, this will take roughly 2 years to get this money invested. (By the way, there is also another plan, a 403(b), and I'm allowed to contribute up to $18.5k/year to *each*, so I won't end up maxing out these contributions even if I throw everything I make at these accounts.)

So here are my thoughts about these options. (If I'm wrong about how any of this works please correct me! I appreciate it in advance.)

The advantage of the taxable option is that I get the benefit of the investment returns right away, while the advantage of my employer's 457(b) is that the earnings aren't taxed until I retire and begin to withdraw the money. It seems to me like the 457(b) option is the better one, based on my naive understanding of how this should work; for example, suppose I get on average 6%/year return, and I retire in 40 years. Then:

1. In the taxable account, the earnings will be taxed at, say, ~~20%~~ 15%. So with a 6% annual interest rate, I only get to keep ~~4.8%~~ 5.1%. Over 40 years, this amount of money will grow to ($45k)x(1.048)~~^(40)~~ ~~= $290k~~ ($45k)x(1.051)^(40) = $330k.
2. On the other hand, in the 457(b), I don't earn interest for all 40 of those years, but the interest that I do earn is untaxed. Being conservative and ignoring completely the interest that I would get during those first 2 years that I'm contributing, I get 6% over the following 38 years, so the investment will grow to ($45k)x(1.06)^(38) = $410k.

The investment in option 2 will get taxed when I retire and use it, but still, it seems like it's a much better option, right? It just seems strange that the better option would be to have so much money just sitting in the bank, not giving any appreciable return, for 2 whole years (I know I could put it in a CD and/or high-yield savings account, but still). So, am I not thinking about this the right way? Is there some other option (should I consider after-tax contributions or something?) that I'm not considering that might make more sense? Thanks in advance!

personalfinance,Downsizing a car while going back to school.,"Hello,

I am looking for some advice about my car situation. I bought a new small SUV (toyota RAV4) 2.5 years ago, it has 0% financing and the payment is $266 a month. I bought this car while working a job making $60k/year in a low COL area so it something I could easily afford. However, I have made the decision to go back to school and start in the fall. I'll support this through a mix of my SOs support, part time gigs, taking Community College classes, savings, and minimal government loans. This is a second degree (my first degree is in psych, this will be a degree in electrical engineering which should increase my earning potential and job opportunities), my loans from my first degree are completely paid off. My SO makes a smaller salary than I did, $40k/year but does not have any car payment or debt. But, his salary is expected to increase within the next year. Needless to say, our budget is tight but manageable and because of my savings combined with his income I should be able to get through the first year of school with little to no debt. Because the car is at 0%, I don't think it makes sense for me to dump my savings into the car to pay it off sooner. This leads to my thought about my car in order to continue to reduce our expenses while I'm in school.

A car is a must in this area as public transportation is almost nonexistent here and both of us have long commutes. My car currently has 29 months left on the loan and is at 0%, it has a trade in value of $12k after the loan is taken into consideration (so $19k before the loan). I could possibly sell it privately for $21k giving me $13k cash towards another car, but I realize this is going to be harder to do. My thought was that I could trade in my car to downsize to something like a slightly used (20-40k miles) Prius or Honda Civic, with the idea that my loan could be decreased by \~$2-4k and spread out over a longer period of time. In the short term this would be easier on our budget and there could be potential savings in gas and I could have a monthly payment closer to $100, which feels like a relief in the short term while I am school. However, my car only has 25K miles on it and will be completely paid off in 2.5 years as long as we continue to stay on top of our finances, plus I would have a car I that has been reliably maintained and should last for a very long time. Furthermore, I realize I won't have 0% financing on a used car but have good to excellent credit so would qualify for a low interest rate but would have to pay interest while I am currently interest free.

So my question is, does it make more sense to just suck it up and pay off the car or to sell it or trade it in for something that is lightly used, less expensive, and more fuel efficient (ie civic, prius, etc) with much lower monthly rate that would be  paid off over a longer period of time? Is is wishful thinking that I could even get a decent enough deal on a smaller car with my trade in to make it worth it?",finance

Or do I keep my current car, get only liability insurance on it for about $40 a month, put $3300 towards my CC debt and just keep chipping away than at my credit card debt as much as I can. 
I have gone over every scenario in my head and each, at least to me has its pros and cons. And like I’ve said, all my family has different opinions. 
Thanks for your advice reddit! And don’t worry, I’ve cut up my CC’s ;)

personalfinance,Can I be a mortgage lender for my in-laws?,"I’m not sure the title is properly worded. 

Together with my husband, we own two homes in WA. We bought the first one 6 years ago with cash, fixed it up and is now worth more tha double of what we paid for due to market growth and the improvements we made. After 4 years of living there, we wanted a nicer home and bought another one but didn’t sell the previous one. For our current home, we put 50% down and got a loan for the rest which we want to payoff next year. The previous home has been empty ever since and mostly used for weekend trips as it sits on good acreage and is in a peaceful location. 

My husband’s parents are looking for a home to buy and they are currently renting. They always loved our previous house and offered to buy it now. My father in law has some weird hate/fear of banks and loans which is why he doesn’t entertain the idea of getting a mortgage. So the idea we came up with is basically pay us “mortgage”. I know we have to get lawyers involved because this is serious business and we need to put everything on paper but I wanted to see if this idea is even possible. Can we sell the home to them and have them pay us principal+interest? The market value of the house is $725k, interest rates around this area according to Google are 4.5%. 

Is this too much of a headache? Alternatively, we could just rent the house to them for the market price of ~$2,500. Thoughts?",finance
personalfinance,"Re: Should I (and, if so, how?) get rid of my whole life ins policy?","TLDR: I’m in a whole life policy and trying to find out if I should get out and, if so, how to do so

Hi all,

Looking for advice re: a Guardian Whole Life 99 policy I started 7 years ago. I signed up with a fee-based adviser, who noted that, given my income—which has since, steadily grown—I should sign up for this policy. I naively didn’t realize that she was fee-based, and figured the policy made sense based on her recommendation. Now, years later—and with some misgivings that have grown with reading—I believe this was a very poor investment where the diversification, insurance, and yield could better be realized through other means. I get somewhat confused by the jargon, and the cynical side of me believes that’s part of the intention. However, I’m looking for some disconfirming bias telling me it’s a good investment; and, if not, some recommendations on what to do.

I pay 997.29/month and 944.17 goes to the cash value of the account (5% management fee goes to my adviser or…?). The current cash value of the account is 49,371 whereas the cost basis has been 83.739. When that settles into my brain, it makes me nauseas. I was told that a benefit of the account is that it can be used to borrow money; with a loan interest rate of 8%, this seems absurd. I did convey my misgivings to my adviser; she noted that the cash value is growing each year by far more than the premium I am paying and that I should consider additional insurance. I remain skeptical that this is a good long-term play and suspect that, given the above, if I surrender the account, I will be paying a \~34k “stupid tax.”

About my family: collective income of 600k (was \~250k at time of policy start), HCOL area, rent apt, NW around $1.3M

Questions:

1) Are my suspicions off and should I stay in- or should I surrender the account and go for term life insurance and knock this up to me being naive/dumb and find a fee-only adviser?

2) the 5% management fee-&gt; does that mean it goes to my adviser? If so, seems like an absurd skimming off the top? Or maybe I misunderstood the details (I feel pretty simple-minded about this)

3) if I do surrender the account, is there a way to salvage the loss? I read about a 1035 exchange by exchanging the cash value into a low cost variable annuity. I’m not sure if I have this right (and it seems hard to fathom having enough gains where this occurs), but would this essentially mean I have an account worth approximately 50k, with the first \~34k of generated yield being tax free? 

4) am ultimately looking for help figuring it out in depth. Who is the best person to guide me- a fee-only adviser or a CPA accountant?

Sorry for such a wordy question.

TLDR: I’m in a whole life policy and trying to find out if I should get out and, if so, how to do so",finance

personalfinance,Should I take a job that I know I’ll hate for 25% more pay and good experience?,"I’ve been working as an aide at a company that has homes for people with disabilities for several years. I’ve been looking for a different job for the past 6 months for better pay but I haven’t had any luck. 



A little personal info: I’m 26. This the only job outside of retail or fast food I’ve had and I didn’t go to college. 



I take home $800 every 2 weeks(more if I work overtime, which I frequently do) and pay about $1200 in bills a month not including gas and groceries. I live with two roommates and have no savings. 



I work 40 hours a week at one house and pick up extra shifts at another house because they are extremely understaffed. They have many open positions including an assistant supervisor for a 25% raise. Their head supervisor suggested that I apply for it as it has been open for a while and no one has applied for it 



The problem is the house is terrible, the residents are difficult to deal with, the staff are overworked and miserable and they have over 200 open hours every week on their schedule that need to be filled so that means it would be my responsibility to find people to come work at the house to fill the open shifts or I would have to work the open hours myself. There are a lot of open shifts on the weekends so I would likely be working 7am-11pm or overnights most Saturdays and Sundays. It would also be nearly impossible for me to take any vacation time. Also my girlfriend works Monday-Friday seeing her could be tough. 


I’ve interviewed for other supervisor positions at other houses before but they’ve always gone to other people. This house is so difficult no one wants to supervise there



#TL;DR



Pros:


•Slightly more pay and I wouldn’t be salary so I can still get overtime 



•It would be good experience and could lead me to getting a better job later



Cons:


•It’s an extremely difficult job



•I’d be working with staff that already have poor morale and are disgruntled 



•I wouldn’t be able to pick my own schedule and would likely be working all day every weekend which means I wouldn’t be able to see my friends or girlfriend as much as I do now 


•Taking a vacation or even a few days off in a row would be nearly impossible

personalfinance,"Is there anything else I should be doing to tackle my student loan debt, so I can move out?","I graduated college last year with about $60,000 of student loan debt-- around $30,000 for federal (both subsidized and unsubsidized) and $30,000 for private. I was able to refinance and consolidate my private student loans, which took my interest and monthly payments down significantly. Currently, I pay $320 monthly with a 5.6% interest. For my federal student loan(s) (it's under one payment plan, but the details of the loan have it separated into 7 separate loans?), I am under income-based repayment and typically pay $200, though summer hit me hard financially since I had no hours to work, and was unable to land anything just for the season. I had been saving up a little bit from the last few paychecks to finance some future cosmetic surgery I have been *desperately* wanting since high school, and I had to tap into that so I have enough for my next private student loan payment. 

I work in education and have just accepted a second job in education that pays a little bit more hourly, but I still won't have many hours weekly when I start in September. I'm struggling to find work that I actually went to college for (graphic design), and still live with my parents. The approximately $500 I pay each month for both is practically my whole paycheck. The rest of my paycheck goes to paying the subscription for my artist portfolio website through Wix, complete with custom url, which I need to apply for jobs. 

Unbury.me puts me at about 20 years to fully pay off everything, and I obviously have no intention with staying with my parents well into my 40's and staying in educational work. I'm still applying to other places when I have the chance, and do freelance work as well, but that has been scarce of late. 

I have no credit cards, no investments (small part of my paycheck is taken out for retirement), and I'm still on my parent's health and auto insurance. I don't own a car (I will inherit my dad's car when he replaces it), and I carpool to work. I don't typically spend money on myself, aside from maybe a shirt or some makeup here and there.

Should I be looking to refinance my private loans again, or is this about as good as it most likely will get? Should I be doing anything differently to reduce the costs, or is it just a matter of landing a solid job at this point?",finance

My whole life I've been horrible with money, anytime I see extra money, I spend, period.  I read this place from time to time and I see the general advice is... well FIX IT!  Easier said than done.  So I'm looking for some broad advice on my situation.

I bring home around 3000.00 a month, housing is completely paid for, but the housing allowance is roughly 1600.00 if I decide to buy a house down the line and live elsewhere.

USAA starter loan: 18,000 at 3%, I basically used this loan to consolidate some student loans.

Student loans: 27,000 capped due to service relief act, average rate is 4%

Auto loan: 680.00

Insurance/gas monthly including SO: 275.00

When I run the numbers, I always see that I SHOULD have around 800-1000 a month extra, but it just doesn't ever seem to be there.  Because like I said, I just SPEND SPEND SPEND.  Eating out, random grocery trips, there is no rhyme or reason to my habits.  We don't have a set grocery trip budget we just buy as we need, so it's probably 200-300 a month.  We don't plan eating out, we just go whenever.  I don't have any discipline with things like Amazon or online shopping.  I see my bank has 389.50 so cool I can blow 40.00 on some stupid crap I want.

I was two years away from paying off my last vehicle when I went full impulse mode and bought what I currently have, I owe 43,000 on it.  That new excitement has quickly worn off so now I'm like shit.  Yeah it has all the bells and whistles but I almost miss what I had before, which was a base model.  I've always had a car payment, because I've always worked for as long as I can remember and loved having the car I wanted.

I do have around 25,000 in a profit sharing/401K from my previous job, which if I return I will be eligible to do a make up contribution, and should be paid out a profit sharing retro payment.  And I do contribute to the TSP.

This post is a long winded rant and I know it's probably hard to follow.  I just am overwhelmed and at a breaking point where I want to fix things.  We aren't struggling paycheck to paycheck, and I'm only going to start making more and more money.  But I would like to be the guy with 20K in savings, who can buy a house and make repairs without worrying about money.  Buy my SO a nice vehicle, have kids and not worry.  Knowing that I can't fix it TODAY and this will be a long term commitment is what makes it worse because I have a hard time looking too far ahead.

So do I dump the vehicle and get something for 20K and cut payments in half?  Do I apply for a deferment on my federal loans (which if approved won't acquire interest) and then aggressively pay off the USAA loan?

I am proud to not have any credit card debt too, but that was as of recently.  Never crazy high balances but just CONSTANTLY throwing stuff on cards that I couldn't immediately afford.  Want some new electronics?  I'll just throw it on this card and then justify it in my head.  HELP!",finance

I am predicting that the next recession is going to be in 1-2 years, around late 2019 or 2020. Interest rates are rising (due to the Fed and federal deficit and debt increases) which is already hurting housing demand, the stock market is going peak I think soon although earnings are strong buybacks seem to be the reason for most of the gains, the constant threat of trade wars is hurting investment already and slowdown in investment is not good. Credit defaults and delinquency are  low but increasing at low end lenders such as Synchrony Financial and regional banks.

personalfinance,New Credit Card or Rental Inquiry,"TL;DR - Is it better to get a credit card first and have the hit when a rental company looks at me OR is it better to apply at a rental place first and have the hit when it's time to apply for a new credit card?

\------

So I've been working my butt off lately and almost have all of my credit card debt paid off. It's been steadily improving over the last few months. In addition to getting my debt paid down, my credit card companies have both increased my limit which is helping a lot too. Pretty much I've raised my credit score about 100 points within a few months. As of now, I'm right around 750/760.

I currently have 2 credit cards and both have high interest rates (aprx 19% and aprx 21%), especially considering my new credit score. I want to apply for a new credit card now that my credit score is so much better in the hopes of getting something with a much lower interest rate to use as my main card. At first I was pretty eager for this, but then I realized that since my finances are in a place that I won't have rollover debt anymore, it isn't hugely important that I get a new credit card ASAP since I will be paying off anything I spend each month. So I decided to wait, at least a few months, maybe a year or so, before I applied for a new credit card just cuz I figured the extra age on my credit history would be good and I don't technically need it.

However, I've recently decided to move out of my current apartment and will be moving within the next month or two. Inevitably they'll run my credit report and it'll leave a small hit on it for like 2 years.

So now I'm wondering, should I get the credit card BEFORE I apply for any new apartments that way my credit score is at it's peak AND my score will still be plenty high to qualify anywhere.

Or Option 2:

Should I stick with my original plan to just hold off on the new credit card, even though when I do eventually apply I'll have the hit from the Rental Company/companies.

Before recently, I'd normally have about 40-70 withheld for federal income tax per check, at least.

I'm a single filer with one job. I've been filing with 2 allowances on my W-4 since I got the job a year and a half ago. Is that even correct? I asked my GM about this particular issue when I first noticed this happening, and she wasn't much help. She told me that because of my tip wages, it's normal for there to be *some* variance in the amount they're taking out of my check, and they should readjust the amount being taken out if it seems like they're not taking out enough, but so far that hasn't happened.

personalfinance,Just turned 25 and looking for some financial input,"Hello Personal Finance,

Posting this in a secondary account I seldom use since friends are aware of my main account. This may be a bit long so bear with me

I just turned 25 and feel like I am a in a good path financially, but was looking for a little direction especially when it comes to loans and investments, I had some questions.

For a little background I work in healthcare and currently make ~$100,000/yr. I have been working since I graduated in 2016. I have a [401k from my previous job and just started it for my current job.](https://i.imgur.com/ak8Jmxb.jpg) Previous job is on the bottom current job is on the top. The reason the current jobs amount is low is because of a requirement to wait 6 months before I was eligible to enroll at this new job. I have a Roth IRA with Vanguard. that I just signed up for, but have not yet made any investments in yet. Current company does not provide company match for 401k.

Next up I have student loans. Total amount [$24,611.36.](https://i.imgur.com/85rTvNN.jpg) This is down from an amount of around $40,000.00 two years ago when I graduated, but I lived at home while I worked and paid a portion of it down with some assistance from my parents (they paid the interest initially so I could start paying the principal on my own). That is the total amount of the loans, but [here](https://i.imgur.com/HpnF429.jpg) and [here](https://i.imgur.com/aHYoIJf.jpg) are the broken down amounts with the interest rates, it is through Great Lakes.

I have an adequate emergency fund. My total savings in my savings account from the past two years totals up to **$52,405.08**. I doubled my yearly salary this year when I began traveling and doing contract work. The money I make is just sitting in my savings account doing nothing which is why I’m interested in starting to invest some of it. I bought a book on investing and have been reading up on that.

Other tid bits: I don’t have a car note currently and the only bill I’m responsible for is rent. Single adult, no pets. My parents pay cell phone and car insurance and I remain on their health plan. I’m very grateful of their generosity in helping me get started in my adult life. I also anticipate receiving between $5,000-$10,000 from them soon as they promised that to me once they sell the house I grew up in as a child.

So after all the background, my questions are:

1) How should I handle my student loans? When my parents pay me the money from the house sale should I just pay them off? Or should I keep paying incremental amounts, they are already paid ahead for about a year currently.

2) With the 401k from my old company through prudential. Should I leave that money alone and do nothing with it? Should I try to roll it over into an IRA?

3) Any suggestions for the set up of the IRA and which funds and allocations you might recommend?

4) Any other additional advice to someone at my point in life that you have to offer?

Thanks if you read my wall of text!

personalfinance,"Oxford Grad with 81k in student loans, moving to SF Bay area. How can I manage my finances sustainably?","Hi, all! I'm a first-time poster in r/personalfinance who could really use some advice.

Here's my situation: I'm an American 24yo female just finishing up a second Master's degree in the UK. My first Master's I didn't pay for, but my undergraduate and this current degree have price tags on them.

My undergraduate student loans have raised with interest to a little over 30k in the past 4 1/2 years, and I took out about 44k in loans last June to study and live in the UK this year. Over the past year this amount has raised to 50k, leaving me with \~81k total.

I have a job secured in San Francisco beginning September which pays 70k a year with benefits, a salary review after the first 6 months, and a yearly bonus. Having lived off of 15k a year before in Maine, I thought this was an amazing financial situation (at a job I love) until I realized the full extent of 1. my student loan debt combined with 2. the cost of living in the SF Bay area.

My US FedLoan exit counseling estimates that my loan amount under a Standard plan would be $910 per month, which is out of the $5k I'll be making (minus tax deductions). They estimate that my debt burden will be ""High"" (it's listed in red and quite scary looking) and that I should be making at least 136k gross income with my amount of debt. Even the Graduated plan option (which has lower payments initially but a larger total amount) lists my debt burden under this plan as ""High"" and says I should be making at least 78k. Here are the two options:

Standard - $910 per month - $109k total - 10 years

Graduated - $516 per month - $116k total - 10 years

There are other plans, but they last for 25 years and often require special circumstances. I'd like to be free of this debt as soon as possible while still maintaining a relatively healthy life balance.

I'm looking into housing in the Bay area as we speak, mostly in Daly City and Oakland since there's little chance of my affording to live in San Francisco. The very lowest prices I've seen for one room in a shared house/apartment run in the $850-1,000 pcm range, and I still have to look into whether or not these are in safe neighborhoods or even reliable postings, since most 1 bedroom apartments seem to go for at least 2.5k. I have little idea how expensive groceries etc. will be, but I don't plan to buy a car at first, because the BART system seems convenient enough and far more affordable.

What can I do to manage my financial situation? Is there any way to deal with these loans and still have a sustainable life in California? I'm excited about moving into the professional world after all this schooling and I love my new job, but am afraid that these loans will get the best of me if I don't have a thorough game plan from the get-go.

I woke up to notice all my Wells Fargo credit information had been changed and fraudulent charges appeared.  I immediately called to report fraud and Wells ""said"" the card was closed and a new one was issued.  The next day there were more fraudulent charges on the new card that I hadn't received and didn't even have access to.  I learned of this from a phone call from Wells.  The card wasn't listed on my online access, nor did I have any number for it.  I immediately called again.  Apparently both accounts were open.  I was required by Wells Fargo to go to a bank to get verified so I could close the account.  After 30 minutes of playing phone tag and dealing with a bunch of nonsense, one card was closed and the other was said to be non existent.  The next morning I wake to have an email from Wells Fargo stating the new card (the non existent one) was in the mail.  I again called and was told I needed to go to a bank to be verified again.  I did and after 2 hours, they refused to close the account.  They credited back the first charges on the original card, but have refused to credit these last 3 charges on the reissued card.  They also refuse to close the account.  All of these charges from the old card and to the new card were made in Riverside, CA - clear across the country from me.  Now, Wells Fargo has put forth my claim to the ""non-fraud"" dispute area.  These are fraudulent charges.  Not only do they refuse to accept verification from the bank, they refuse to close the account, and refuse to take away these fraudulent charges.  I have filed complaints with the BBB, AG, and the Federal Trade Commission.  Today I am mailing a certified letter as well.  My account is paid off, minus the fraudulent charges, but I just don't know what to do.  I appreciate your help.",finance
CryptoCurrency,Zen Protocol May Become an Interest for Countries Around the World,"Basically, we’re at the dawn of a new era.

Zen Protocol may not be the first to do so, but getting into the stocks market (Bilaxy) is a magnitude that cannot be ignored by anyone, including of course, the countries themselves. Just think about all the possibilities with this.

First point: It gives an alternative. I don’t think that any country will completely abandon the classic financial systems up to date, But having the option for another platform is always a better thing than having one less.

Second Point: Things behind the curtains. Governments will really benefit from things that allow them to send things under the radar - And a thing like that can be really helpful for them.

Third point: Security. Things are beefed up with Blockchain, so why the hell not? Not to mention smart contracts basically cover 90% of the things a government usually does..

Fourth point: Mining.It may sound like something unrealistic, but considering Zen mining is pretty profitable (using Zen’s formulas and calculations), maybe a country can invest some if its resources to mining? When we think deep into it, a government has way more power to handle than the average miner, and even from the biggest mining farms out there. A small percentage that will be used for this can create a whole different game.

That’s 4 reasons from the top of my head.. Guess there are tons of others as well. So things can be pretty optimistic when it comes to Zen Protocol. Just think about a country that sets an agreement with the platform - It gets a whole new advantage, and a country that’ll understand it before the others will be on top.

personalfinance,Wanna buy a newer used truck,"Currently own a 2000 silverado 2500 long bed, regular cab, 4x4. She has quite the list of issues, and i have put a decent amount of money into her (bought her 3600 out the door, put another 2k into her since I owned her). I am at a crossroads of is it worth it to keep going or should I consider a newer truck. I been finding 2016 f250 super dutys for around 25 - 27k. I think they are the best deal I am finding but they are too much for my blood. So I dropped down another 10k and started looking at 3/4 ton trucks for 10k-20k. I found a nice looking 2012 f250 super duty with 95k on it, one owner, clean title, not to far from my area (around 75 miles) for 16,500 before tax title, any other fees. I literally just paid off my 2016 malibu like a week ago. I wanted to enjoy no car payment but my truck being the way she is..... I am tired of driving it less than 50 miles and something new breaking on me. It's a good truck, but she needs easily another 2k plus in work to stop these issues of giving me problems when I am using her for what I need her for.

My credit score is excellent, I could swing around 2 - 3k down and I could either trade my current truck in (which I know I wont get anything over 2k if I am lucky), or I could private sell my truck for hopefully some more money, or even part her out.

I honestly am not to impressed with the interest rates I am seeing right now.  My car loan was a 2.59% at 60 or 72 months (dont remember the mature date). I just got the loan last year for my malibu. I been working hard to pay it off. The payment was 185 a month. I bought the car for 13,500 before taxes and all that, and I also put down 4k.

I been looking at all the banks online like light stream, chase, pnc, boa, and when I look at the rates are before submitting any info, I freeze and ask myself do I really want to take a hard inquiry for a 4 percent or higher rate......

I have not looked at local credit unions, I am kinda thinking this is something I should consider.

What do you ya'all think?

edit- not that it matters, but my malibu is a certified pre owned. I figured at that price I couldn't resist. It had 17k on it when I bought her, and now I am sitting around 35k.",finance

I understand that my parents will have to open it with me or add me as an authorized user to their card, but I have a few questions.


The main point of this is to build up credit- if I get added as an authorized user to a parents card, and they have bad credit, does this reflect on me? And also do all banks even report authorized users to credit bureaus? (Currently we are looking at TD bank BC my mom has an account there, but we’d be fine opening somewhere else if they don’t do this).

So I guess I’m asking, what are some Reccs for cards and banks so I can start building credit early? In regards to banks, I would also like a checking account with an interest rate, because I’m going to be depositing a little over $1k.",finance

personalfinance,Debt Consolidation and Home Equity Loan/LOC,"Hi All,

I am looking for some guidance on how to consolidate some of our debt and pay things down quickly and I was hoping that someone could help steer me in the right direction. I've done a bit of research, but I'm a bit ignorant to how things will benefit me in the most beneficial way over time. 

So here's the situation, a lot has happened in the past 2 years which has drawn down our savings account and increased our monthly bills, so after all is said and done, we have about $1,000 leftover at the end of every month which we parcel out and put a little extra towards outstanding debt, and a little into savings. We're not drowning and we have money in savings, but I feel like we could be smarter with our money. So my goal is to aggressively focus on getting our debt (what i call ""stupid debt"") down, pay it down quickly, and start a plan to building up our savings again (we went from $30k down to $17k, but i'd like to not touch the $17k if possible for emergencies).

So there are 3 stupid debt situations that I would like to focus on:

1) $4,000 - credit card, 15% interest rate

2) $8,000 - medical bills (daughter was born 6 weeks early, 15 day NICU stay), no interest, potential payment plan for 18 months, 20% discount if paid in full

3) $10,000 - student loans, 6.5% fixed interest rate

In regards to the medical bill, I've already spoken with the hospital and applied for a discount/financial assistance. We were denied because our household income is over their threshold. My next plan of attack is to see how much of a discount I could get (if any) if I were to pay the entire balance up front. The last option would be an 18 month payment plan. Edit: we would get a 20% discount if paid in full. New balance would be about $5800.

So these are the options I was exploring:

Get a home equity loan/LOC - Our house is currently worth $314,000 (Zillow estimate) and we owe $235,000 at a rate of 4.25% fixed. If we were to borrow 80% against the value of the house, minus the mortgage, we should have about $16,000 available. I would probably then look into putting that towards the medical bill (only to receive the lump sum discount) and the credit card, and anything leftover would go towards student loans. 

Or, use the loan towards the medical bill (again for the lump sum discount) and the student loans, and look into a balance transfer to another CC that has no interest for X months and no balance transfer fees. 

Does any of this make sense? or am I completely off base in what I'm looking to do? Obviously i could continue to just pay everything monthly, but I can't stand paying interest on my CC and my student loans and I'd like to be able to get everything paid off ASAP.",finance
personalfinance,Question about Low Down Payment Mortgages,"This is mostly a theoretical question since I'm not in a position to buy a home.  For people who live in expensive housing markets (high rents and home prices), does the 20% down rule really apply?  I'm in California, and just about any 3 bedroom house that isn't falling apart and is close to a major metropolitan area where there are jobs, will set you back half a million or more. For middle class types, does it really make sense to save up 100 grand (to the detriment of retirement account contributions, etc.) if you can afford the monthly payment (including PMI and higher interest rate than in the traditional 20% down scenario) on a 5-10% downpayment?  

I get that you can end up underwater on the mortgage more easily with a low downpayment, but that happened to plenty of people who bought around 2005/2006 regardless of how large their downpayment was. It seems to me that it would make sense to avoid tying up so much of your cash in a home purchase, particularly if the main goals are to make your housing costs more predictable and pass on the house to your kids when you die.",finance

personalfinance,Advice on Paying for Grad School: Take out more loans or withdraw from retirement accounts?,"Hello r/personalfinance! I'm a 28-year-old grad student (law school) about to start on my 2nd year of 3.  I'm looking for some help on the most efficient way to handle my finances.

I left my county government job of 4 years in order to go to school full time.  My problem is that I have maybe ""over-invested"" in retirement accounts, and I'm looking for advice on how to best withdraw this money (or if I even should) in order to pay for room/board and other expenses.

I have over $25,000 tied up in four different retirement accounts.  I have had no income so far in 2018, and don't plan to have any.  BUT I HAVE contributed $5,500 to a Roth IRA in 2018 (moved from my traditional IRA). 

Up until now I had planned to borrow the maximum amount of direct unsubsidized loans $20,500.  I am still eligible for $17,702 in Dir Grad PLUS loans (at 7.6% interest).

Once tuition and fees are paid for I will receive $5,287 to get me through 2018.  I'll receive another about the same amount for Spring Semester 2019. The problem is I need a little over double that in order to pay my expenses. 

Here are what I think my options are: 

1. Withdraw from retirement accounts, biting the bullet and paying the 10% fee on top of the likely 12% income tax.

2. Borrow the Dir Grad PLUS loans and deal with increased interest rates later. 

3. My parents have very graciously told me they would set aside $300 a month for me and would pay out that account once I finish law school, or if I had an emergency of any kind.  At this point that would be about $3,000.  I do not consider myself to be in an emergency situation, but I don't know how much I would be saving if I asked for that now (since it would be tax free) instead of borrowing at the higher interest rates or taking money from retirement.  Even if I took this money I would still need about $2K-3K. 

Gov't Retirement Accounts: 

401: ""My Total Balance"" = $5065.50 ""My Vested Balance"" = $4052.40 

80% makes sense because I worked there for four years. (not really sure how much of this is actually mine to keep) 

457: $10183.87 Rate of Return for both is 3.5% 

Personal retirement accounts: 

Traditional IRA: $6811 

Roth IRA: $5518

I would do the math myself, but am not sure how to predict how much the student loans would cost me in the long run, and I want to make sure I have all the rules correct about early withdrawals from retirement accounts.

**TLDR:** I need about $5K-6K for school each semester, should I borrow it from retirement accounts, borrow more financial aid at higher interest, or ask my parents for the $$$ they already have set aside for me?",finance

personalfinance,"Tax amounts on 401k withdrawal (US, ME)","Hello,
I recently changed jobs and need to decide what to do with my 401k from my previous employer. I'm deciding between either rolling it into my new employer's plan or cashing it out.

My question is in regards to cashing out. Currently there's $13,000 available if I were to cash out. My understanding is that I would be charged a 10% penalty, 20% would be withheld for federal tax and 2-8% would be withheld for state tax (depending on the state) and I would be issued a 1099R.

What I'm trying to understand is, how are the percentages calculated, meaning is it 10% of 13,000, then 20% of 11,700 then 2-8% of 9,360 OR is it 32-38% of the 13,000 that's available?

How do I know how much state tax will be taken (in ME)?

And finally, are all the taxes taken out when I cash out enough to cover it? Meaning will I end up owing even more at tax time?

personalfinance,Sell house or BK?,"preliminary info…

Three years ago I had a six figure job and we were living quite beyond our means. this job was essentially gifted to me and I was quite overpaid. With my skills, I could not even come close to making what I was making anywhere else. I thought this job would last forever and spent accordingly, new cars, house, other unsecured debt, etc. 

I eventually lost this job suddenly and was forced into immediate financial peril. While I did qualify for unemployment, it was obviously a fraction of what I was used to bringing home. Vehicles were quickly repossessed and we were soon severely delinquent on our mortgage. 

Because we traded in negative equity vehicles and then purchased more expensive negative equity vehicles on top of warranties, tax, docs, etc. both auto loans were considerably deficient. Add to which the banks made no effort at fetching top dollar for them and we were left with deficiency balances of about 15K/ea, for a total of 30K.

now let’s talk taxes… at this job, I was promised, and always given a year end bonus that was quite substantial, in addition to my weekly salary. Because this bonus was taxed so much in the past, I did not withhold any taxes from checks because I didn’t want to leave that much money on the table as, as they say “an interest free loan” to the IRS (my refund the previous year was $8K and I withheld nothing but the bonus). Well obviously you know what happens next, I was terminated before getting the bonus and thus now owe the IRS about 24K in back taxes. I’m on an installment plan where I pay $315/mo for some period of time, and that’s fine, I can continue to do that.

k so sprinkle in some other stupid debt and we are sitting with $70K in UNSECURED (could be discharged in bk) debt, and another $25K in debt that can’t be discharged ($23k IRS, $2K student loans)

I drive a 12 year old Honda that is paid off and worth a couple grand, my wife drives a 8 year old volkswagen that has maybe a couple thousand in equity at best. we have a handful of cool things around the house (75” TV, iMac, etc) but nothing super lavish or that we couldn’t part with and most likely nothing that would even need surrendered to the trustee anyway, but like I said, push come to shove, if he wants the big screen or my wife’s wedding ring or my cheap guns, they’re all yours…

ok, now to the real issue at hand…

So we have a home that is worth approximately $380K before selling costs (zestimate is $421K, county tax assessment is $374K) that we owe $325K on. The home has appreciated quite a bit since we bought it 5 years ago and many, including myself, believe it will continue to appreciate… perhaps faster in the next 5-10 years given that we are in an area with extremely rapid growth. After I lost my job, I was able to take advantage of some program through my lender whereby like $90K of my principle was bought up by HUD and my interest rate was brought down taking my payment from $2,340/mo to a much more manageable $1,730/mo which I’ve been paying ever since. This new rate is locked in, the trial period is over, that is my payment now, it cannot be changed (unless I refinance, default, etc)

so before the Dave Ramsey fan club tells us to sell everything and eat Top Ramen and move in with our parents and work 106 hours a week til we’re out of debt, i’m going to tell you right now that’s not gonna happen. I have zero shame in filing bankruptcy. ZERO. without taking a political turn here, I have no moral quandary with letting the big banks take the fall here, so please do not factor this into the equation. I’ve heard that this sub is notoriously anti-bk, but it exists for a reason. You can think i’m a degenerate scumbag all you want, it shouldn’t affect with the proper solution is here.

our state has a 100K homestead exemption for bankruptcy. As I understand it, that means that up to 100K in home equity is exempt and thus can’t be gone after by the trustee. we should fall under this amount by even the most generous of appraisals.  

from where I sit, it seems like a no-brainer to keep paying the IRS as agreed, file BK, keep the house and start fresh. There are however certain friends and family that believe that selling the house in order to start clean is the best move. I could not disagree more, and here is why…

if our mortgage was still $2300/mo as it was when we purchased the home, I’d completely agree. that is beyond our means, for sure. However with the HUD bailout, and 90K in principle sitting on the back burner, our mortgage payment is $300-$500 LESS than the rents in our area for comparable homes, and only $200-$300 more than the rent for the homes that we would be moving to… For comparison, our last home that we moved from, which is HALF the square footage and extremely run down and in a less desirable neighborhood currently rents for $1495/mo, just $240 less than the mortgage on a home we own and will almost certainly increase in value by $100k-$250K in the next 10 years.

Hatred for bankruptcy aside, can anyone here convince me that selling our home, paying off the debts and then renting is the smart play?

PS, I didn’t get into my income and whatnot because this was long enough and it doesn’t seem relevant. I understand that there are folks out there that are on budgets so tight that $200-$300/mo is the difference between making it and not making it, but we are not of that situation. I have the ability to find that money each month, no problem. This “dilemma” as I see it (if you can call it that) is not about debt-to-income or really even proper budgeting advice, but is more about a one-time strategy pertaining to the bankruptcy and potential upside of long term real estate ownership.

PPS, I don’t care about what bankruptcy will do to my credit. I have no desire to take on any more debt anytime soon, I already have a house, I will never finance a car again, I just don’t care…

thanks so much",finance

I searched through the reddit here and couldn't really find much on this...I'm a long time lurker but first time poster so go easy on me :)

I'll be receiving a bonus from work for and it's pretty significant but it'll be taxed as regular income as it's a phantom share distribution. 

Having said that I live in California and I'm confused at the amount that should be withheld for taxes.

Essentially looking at the tax brackets I'm married filing jointly and sit in the 24% brackett as described here.

[https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/taxes/federal-income-tax-brackets/](https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/taxes/federal-income-tax-brackets/)

 **24%**$165,001 to $315,000$28,179 plus 24% of the amount over $165,000 

So that's pretty straightforward, where my confusion is relates to how the state income tax applies?

Checking just the state income tax brackets I would sit here:

[https://www.tax-brackets.org/californiataxtable](https://www.tax-brackets.org/californiataxtable)

 For earnings between $105,224.00 and $537,500.00, you'll pay **9.3%** plus $4,632.86 

So because this bonus would push me up to 220,000 for the year does that mean I should withhold 24%+9.3%=**33.3% ??**

The TLDR of the question is does the 24% usually include the state or is it something you add on top? I used this site paycheck simulator site for California to figure it out and seems that combined I pay about 25% (per the site anyways) but perhaps I'm totally missing something here (posted the output below)... How much should I withhold (or get my employer to withhold) in the end?

personalfinance,"[Auto] I recently purchased an extended warranty with a used vehicle, and I'm now second guessing my decision","So on Saturday, after doing a lot of research, I settled on the car I wanted to buy. I went to the dealer and started making the purchase. Now, I'm financing the vehicle, even though I can afford to pay cash, I want to build my credit, among other reasons. 

Obviously I'm trying to get the best interest rate I can get on my loan, and so when the finance guy at the dealership offered me an extended liftime and unlimited miles warranty on the vehicle for just $1,800 (I guess it is originally $5,400 and because I'm a student I get a discount?) which would also give me a 2 point decrease in my loan amount for some reason.

Now, all of this sounded great in the dealership, and I made the decision to go through with it based on the fact that it was a good discount, would reduce the amount I would pay in principle, and it might come in handy later if I end up needing repairs.

However, now it's Monday, and I'm sorta regretting my decision. I'm not sure if it was worth it or not to get the extended warranty and get the 2 point decrease in the APR. This is my first time buying a car, so I guess my question is: Am I right to be regretting the decisions or was my decision okay?

Obviously at this point it's probably too late (unless there is some way I can cancel the warranty. Not sure how it work,) but I'd still like to have the peace of mind either way, whether it was dumb or not. I can afford the extra 1800, but obviously thats still a significant amount of money that would be nice not to spend if I don't need to.


UPDATE: I called Alpha Warranty Services. They said that since I am within 30 days of the contract purchase, I am eligible for a cancellation and a full refund. However, I do have to do that through the car dealership. I'll be talking to them later today. Thanks for your help! I'm glad this lesson won't be costing me as much as I thought it would.",finance

personalfinance,First Time Home Buyer,"Hello,

I  thought I would never want a home, but we just had twins, and I feel like renting is just not cutting it anymore. We're currently paying for a 3 bedroom 1 bathroom house for about 1200 a month. For the next tier of houses, rent jumps to about 2k a month.   

 I am a veteran, in my late 30s, I have 220k in an IRA, 35k in a brokerage account, and about 10k in silver. I am making about 75k a  year with just a student loan.  My car is fully paid off. No credit card debt, but on the same token, my credit score is about 600. I know I need to get that number up. My wife does not work, but she does not carry any debt. I live in upstate New York and I really want to take advantage of the VA Home Loan program.  
The questions I have are the following:
1. Is shooting for 330k house sound silly for someone in my current situation?
2.  How should I go about educating myself about the VA home loan program(any subreddits)?
3. With rising interest rates it might cause a recession and would housing prices drop? (market timing question)
4. Can anyone explain to me how I can take full advantage of the VA home loan program?


I really appreciate all the answers to my questions. It's really nice that you would take your time to help me a total stranger. I know I have asked a lot so I wanted to say thanks in advance.",finance
personalfinance,Found out I owed a dr bi when I received a collections statement. Paid the original debtor but credit report is showing I paid the collection agency,"Last year my son went to the ER. His father didn't inform me that his insurance had lasped and never told me about the bills going to his house. He just saw my name and threw them away. 

So a year later I get a collection notice on my credit report. As soon as I realized what had happened I called the original Dr office I owed and paid the debt and asked them "" so are you going to remove the collection account or should I call them?"" And I was told it would be removed automatically.

Now two months later it's showing on my credit report that I paid Americollect.

When I called Americollect they said because they held the account, my Dr forwarded my payment to them.

This makes no sense. The last time this happened to me and I paid the original debtor, the collection account was removed.

Now, it's sitting on my credit report as a closed account and is pulling my numbers down.

Of course the office I need to call is only open while I'm at work so haven't had a chance to call them.

But how can they forward my payment to another company when I didn't authorize it? I authorized payment to them, not Americollect.

Had I known that is what they were going to do I would've asked Americollect for proof of debt and tried to negotiate my payment down 

I feel robbed of that option because the Dr office never mentioned they were going to pass my payment along. I couldve asked for the collections account to be withdrawn prior to payment, now, my money was sent elsewhere and I'm anticipating the Dr office will tell me there's nothing they can do.

But the whole thing seems weird. This is not how my previous old debts played out. In the past if I pay the original debtor, collection accounts get removed entirely.

Do I have any grounds to fight this?

They got their money and I got a closed account. I'm pretty miffed.",finance
personalfinance,"Pay off student loans, invest in an IRA, or save for my first house?","In brief, my situation is that I am in the fortunate position of having extra money right now that I could use to completely pay off my remaining student loans. Or, I could take that extra money and invest it via an IRA account. Or, should I add this extra money to the savings I have been building up toward the down payment for my first house? I understand the general advice that investing money in an index fund (or similar) would likely result in a better return on investment than a lump sum payoff of relatively low-interest (\~3.9%) loans. Still, there are a few questions that I'm pondering as I make this decision.

The amounts I am talking about here would not exceed my IRA contribution limits for 2018 or 2019. I have no other loans or debt to factor into this decision.

First, my wife and I have been slow to invest our money in IRAs. Our unfortunate habit has been just holding large low-interest savings accounts (1%ish) and a few CDs (at about 2% interest). We are trying to change our ways, but realistically, it may take us several months to actually move money into our IRAs. Therefore, paying off the loans early may make sense for us as a way to feel like we're investing, this time with a guaranteed return (of about 4%).

Second, we are currently saving up to buy our first house in early 2019. We are budgeting for a down payment separately from our retirement savings, but in theory we could use this lump sum to increase the amount of our down payment instead of paying off student loans or investing it in an IRA. I consider it more important to save for retirement--is that correct?

Third, my student loans currently carry a 3.9% interest rate. That rate has gone up in recent months (as recently as 2017, the average interest rate on my loans was closer to 3%, and in 2016 they were under 3%). I believe that the rate on these loans may increase again in the near future, but they may not actually increase. Is 3.9% a high enough interest rate to make the lump sum payoff ""worth it"", or should we wait to see if the rate goes over 4%? Where is the line?

Fourth, if I continue to make my regular monthly payments, my student loans would be paid in full by September 2021 (i.e. three years from now). That means the 4% interest ""earnings"" I would gain my paying all of the loans off now would produce a relatively small dollar amount (a few hundred dollars over three years). However, I would ""recover"" a fairly large amount of money in my monthly budget if I paid the loans off early (several hundred dollars per month). That monthly amount would be redirected right into my IRA account. With this monthly amount, my wife and I could afford to save up to max out our IRAs in 2019 and beyond. However, we could max out our IRAs in 2018 if we do not pay off the loans.  What is the right strategy here?

TL;DR Is it ""worth it"" to pay off the loans today? Should we use this lump sum to increase the size of our down payment for our first house? Or should my wife and I get serious and invest the same lump sum in an IRA, while still making regular payments on my student loans for the next three years?",finance
personalfinance,Just under $300k in student loan debt and need advice.,"So I feel like I've horribly mismanaged my student loan debt despite all my best intentions.  I've spoken with financial advisers who have either recommended the Dave Ramsey ""pay off the smallest ones for a psychological boost"" method or told me ""we can't give you any advice until you have a stable income.""  I hope someone here can give me some direction.  Thanks in advance.

I graduated from dental school in 2013 with a combination of Direct Student Plus loans, Direct Sub. Stafford loans, and Direct Unsub. Stafford loans totaling $249,876.  I completed two residency programs in the following 3 years, deferring payments, though making the occasional drops in the bucket.  The residency programs were tuition-free and had stipends of $40k for the first year and $60k for the next 2 years.  I set up income-driven repayment after graduating and joined a private practice as an independent contractor where I was paid very erratically.  I made extra loan payments as I could, but it was tough as I wasn't sure what I would get paid and when since I had to wait for the insurance payments to come through.  I left the practice after a year (I made about $106k pre-tax) and took a job at an FQHC where I am making $200k pre-tax in a state with no income tax.  I still qualify for IDR, which is about $610/month.  I now have a principal balance of $267,735.32 and $23,832.50 in accrued interest.  Fedloan indicates I've made about $80k in payments so far.  I've been paying $4k on top of the $600 IDR payments every month and it feels like the balance just isn't changing.  Furthermore, I just noticed the following on the Fedloan page regarding IDR: ""You cannot pay ahead past your IDR anniversary or recertification date. Any extra funds remaining at the time of your IDR anniversary or recertification deadline will be immediately applied to your loans (not to a future bill), and your paid ahead status will end. However, you still have the option of paying extra, and you can enter paid ahead status again, through your next IDR anniversary or recertification.""  Is this why my balance doesn't seem to be changing?  Should I get off IDR so I can just hammer away at my loans?

I have no credit card debt, but I owe about $5k on my car.  I have $21,229 in a SEP-IRA (created to help with taxes at my accountant's recommendation), $2,930 in a 401k with my FQHC job, and $25,000 in savings.  

I've been warned away from the PHS/IHS/military commitments by co-workers who have been unhappy with their experiences.  I do not come from a disadvantaged background and don't seem to qualify for some of the forgiveness options because of this.  I've considered consolidating my loans for a better interest rate (currently averaged at 6.7%), but worry that if I switch from federal loans to private, I wouldn't be eligible for forgiveness associated with working in public health.  My credit score is 783/""excellent"" per my most recent report.

To further complicate matters, I have a long history of depression and was recently diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety.  I'm being treated with therapy and meds, but I really, really do not like my line of work and the idea that I am stuck in this job forever because of my student loan debt definitely doesn't help.  I don't have a back-up plan.  I've considered just working 1 day a week and staying on IDR for the rest of my life, but I don't know if that's even a realistic option.  I feel like no one I've spoken to understands student loans at all and no one has been able to give me any sound advice.  Any help would be greatly, greatly appreciated.  Even if it is just to tell me I'm stuck in this job and debt forever, so at least I could try to accept it.  Thanks for reading.",finance

personalfinance,Would you buy a home in this situation?,"Hey all, longtime lurker and learner and really value the opinions of people here so thank you in advance and sorry for the anon post.

My wife and I are looking at buying a home, but something just feels wrong. I have no doubts we can afford it. 800+ credit, ~100k saved for home purchase with another 30k emergency fund, which is what we figure would be ~6 months with a mortgage. Income ~210k. No loans or car payments or anything, bills paid in full each month and tracking all of our expenses combined it's less than 4k a month and honestly a lot of that could be cut back. Max 401ks as well as Roth IRAs and a 3rd account because my wife works for the government that's essentially another tax advantaged account with the same limits as a 401k and she contributes to a pension fund as well. After all that, we're left with ~3600 each month. 

We can afford a mortgage of course and could always cut back somewhere on the retirement accounts if we needed to, but what we're struggling with is the home prices. In our area things have pretty much doubled in the last 5 years and it just seems unsustainable, like with interest rates going up that prices really have to start coming down and we're already seeing signs that the market is slowing and more homes are for sale. The average sales price is currently ~5x the average family income and we'd probably be looking in the 350-400k range for a new build. We just feel the prices are high and our rent is cheap, 2 bed, 2 bath for $940 a month. We're torn as to just keep renting and maybe take advantage of a mega backdoor Roth and travel more, or bite the bullet on a home purchase.

personalfinance,I made a huge mistake taking out student loans and I don't know where to go from here.,"Hi Reddit,

I have been dreading making this post but I really don't have many people around me to lean on for financial advice.

I am 25, I graduated from art school in 2016. I have been an artist my entire life, my whole dad's side of my family are artists. I never questioned choosing art as my career. I grew up with a single mom and I was pretty much dirt poor. I was the only one out of my mom, brother, and I to go to college and finish. I took out massive parent plus loans, federal loans, and received some grants. I have a bachelor's in illustration but I am also very skilled in the Adobe Suite and I have used that to my advantage to get a job in LA that pays be 20/hr that involves printing and photo editing. (still not really a lot to live on).

I guess I didn't realize the severity of my mistake at the time. My family doesn't have a lot of money and no one warned me about taking out these loans. I realize I need to take responsibility for my actions but I also really wish I had more advice before signing on to debt I could never pay off. I am 25 now and I realize I should have gone to community college and picked a more stable area of study and pursued art on the side. I cannot go back in time and I have really been suffering for it. I realize now that I cannot have the things I wanted for a long time now (marriage, children) because these loans will bog me down for the rest of my life. My career path doesn't allow for the kind of money I need to pay off my debt. As an artist I know it will take me a long time to make art my full time career (I am working on selling prints for textiles for art licensing.) I am confident in my art ability but it is a long career path.  My mom hasn't even worked in over 10 years. She lives with my grandparents. I have around 100k in student loans for a private art school. I have been deferring my loans. I pay about $800 in rent and have been saving to buy a used car. I don't have credit at all. I feel stuck at my job because it is rare to find a full time thing with my degree (bachelor of fine art in illustration.)

Even paying the lowest amount of my income back each month it is around $400-$500 per MONTH. I see no point as the interest will continue to pile up and i'll never pay it back. I am severely depressed over this and I honestly don't see a point in continuing on some days because this has truly ruined my life. I wish I had financial role models to guide me when choosing to go to art school. What are some programs I can look into? What is the point in me pursuing anything at all when I will be paying most of my income into this forever?

BlockChain,DACC Uses Blockchain Technology to Help Content Creators Gain Profits,"The competition for content creators among major content platforms has intensified in 2018. At the beginning of the year, Tencent and Today’s Headlines have announced new sharing strategies to support originality. Netease also said that it will use the visible “real gold and silver” to subsidize the content creators. Under the dual benefits of capital and platform policies, a large number of excellent authors have joined the lines of content creators. As the Internet, especially the mobile Internet content distribution industry, matures, the current mode of content monetization is becoming clear. Authors create and upload content, and the platform distributes rewards to authors according to their content’s popularity (e.g. views). Creators earn profits therefore continue to invest in creation.

However, the negative impact is that the convenient content sharing also make infringement and piracy easier. The existing relevant mechanisms of the content platform are mainly aimed at the main content creators and are less focused on wider and more varied creators, who are vulnerable to piracy. At the national level, it has been repeatedly highlighted that the intellectual property rights should be emphasized, but due to limited technical means this problem has not been resolved.

DACC, which is based on blockchain technology, will solve this problem. It is the world’s first decentralized IAM-based content blockchain, dedicated to solving the rights management of content and user data in the content and media industries.

**DACC Uses Blockchain Technology to Secure and Enhance the Rights of Content Creators**

DACC’s solution based on the cryptographic principle of the blockchain solves the problem of ownership confirmation in the content transaction process. The original content creators can conveniently store the timestamp with the author information, permission rights, and other data on the blockchain, and the information recorded by the blockchain will be permanently recorded and cannot be tampered with, thereby generating a verifiable, complete and legally valid electronic certificate. When it comes to copyright transaction, DACC chains will also record the traces of the transaction. Moreover, the open, transparent and traceable features of the blockchain will guarantee the fairness of the transaction to the maximum extent, make the copyright clear and maximise the interests of content creators.

At the same time, DACC will issue platform Tokens, which are designed to help improve the community’s ecology. The increasing content assets on the platform will generate new values and hence attract more users. With the increase of users, the consumption of Tokens and the corresponding value of Tokens will increase, which in turn continue to attract more content creators, forming an active community that is self-promoting and highly recognised among members. The increasing participation of community members will increase the influence of the works, and when the influence is large enough it will promote the secondary development of IP. Then content creators and fans as content distributors can gain profits from the appreciation of digital currency.

https://i.redd.it/2it5vepehke11.png

**DACC Raises Creative Enthusiasm, and Feedback on Circulation Data Promotes High-quality content**

In the Internet industry, the thorniest issue many content creators face is that media giants have the most discourse power. Once the work is sold, creators loses control of their work.

In the ecological community constructed by DACC, the platform is completely decentralized. Without intermediaries to earn the price difference, the creator sell the content directly to others, which gives the creator the right to set the price, and every income from the subsequent purchase of the work benefits the creator. This peer-to-peer model maximises the protection of content creator’s ownership of the work and consumer privacy. Besides, this peer-to-peer model also makes the communication between the creator and the consumer more direct, so that they can work together to polish the work, allowing content creators to continuously improve the quality of the work. Meanwhile, the data circulating in the chain can be effectively fed back to the content creators through the tracking function of the blockchain technology. The content creators can then analyse and re-create to produce the fine content.

DACC is creating a high-quality creative environment for content creators through the clarity of data validation, the fairness of interests, and the socialization of the community. It also incentivises creators to produce better content through the its unique incentive mechanism. In the near future, DACC will thoroughly eliminate the drawbacks of the content creation industry and enhance the overall benefits of content creators through the gradual improvement of the ecology. It will guarantee the circulation and ownership of content works and protect the interests and privacy of all participants in the industry ecology.",cryptocurrency

Now I'm pretty aware of my finances, and I learned that she liked on her tax return, and is doing it again. I can't get FAFSA, because she doesn't want an audit to be caused due to my school. 

I already had to take a $11,000 private loan to pay for housing and school, $6,000 this year (government loan) which is split between this upcoming semester and the last, which I assume I'll get back as it's not being used for school. Still had to pay about $500 last semester as FAFSA and the loans did not cover it all, which is about $6,200 a semester. 

My plan this year was to take out a $11,000 government loan at 1.2% interest, then pay off my private loans which are at a terrible 11.9% and 4% while going to school, and working just to triple downpay my 11.9% loan while it is deffered which would be about $310 a month, while using the $11,000 and FAFSA for school and rent, which would cover my rent and school for about 1.5 years. Which I could pay my 11.9% interest loan off heavily and absolutely focus on school rather then work 40 hours as I did last semester. 

Anyways, she filed head of household and refuses to amend it. My stepfathers' income was the main reason I didn't get a lot of aid (80k) where my mom is (21k). He recently pasted away, so my mom's income is now 21k, but she won't refile until next year. 

Whats a good option for private loans with a lower interest rate. For my first two private loans I had a co-signer, which I am unable to use now as she's retired, and I don't really want to feel like a bother. Should I go with discover instead? I really would like a lower interest rate. 11.9% is just way too high",finance

personalfinance,$400k 27yo... what should I do?,"Hey guys! Long time lurker here and I think some of you would have some really helpful pointers for my particular situation.

In the next month or so I will be getting around $400k (after tax) from the sale of my business. I am currently 27 years old, married, and just bought a house (~$200k).

While I feel I have a good understanding of how to run a business, I struggle with figuring out how to make my money work for me. Below is sort of the debt and overall situation. Thank you guys in advance for your input!

My debt: 
- $18k student loans (average interest rate around 5%
- $15k left on a auto loan at 4%

My wife’s debt:
- $75k student loans (masters degree... expensive), average interest ~6%

Basically, from the $400k I am going to need something to live on for about a year while I figure out what to do next. I have no problem with being frugal during this time and my wife will be working still. 

My question basically comes down to the following:

Should we be paying off a good chunk of our student loans? Or, should we be throwing all of this money into index funds/other investments?

I have thought about trying to help her refinance her student loans, but from what I understand “fed loans” offer a lot of protection in terms of payment options in the case that something were to happen. She is in public service so she does qualify for the 10 year loan forgiveness, but right now they consider both of our incomes to determine that payment and it really offers no benefits... with the current payment they have us paying we would end up paying them off in full anyways... her income currently is under $50k if that helps.

If there is any other information that could be helpful, let me know and I’ll do my best to provide it.

personalfinance,Is a Cash-Out Refinance right for me?,"My wife and I bought a fixer-upper a few years back. Almost all the work we've put into the place has been with cash, but last year we got a little over our heads with a desperately needed backyard hardscape project that ended up putting $15,000 on a credit card (yikes). That said, I'm pretty proud to say that in just three years the value of our home has skyrocketed from $160,000 to somewhere around $300,000. 

We've been putting about $400/month into the credit card, and we have a low-interest (4.99% APR) auto loan with about $4000 left on it that adds another $150/month payment. We aren't drowning, but with the new credit card payment, our monthly finances tend to barely break even, and whenever we have an unexpected expense, it usually ends up back on the credit card, which in turn makes it feel like we're barely paying it down.

With all this, I'm wondering whether we should consider a cash-out refinance to clear out the credit card debt that's keeping our budget so tight. We're planning on staying in the house long-term (if not forever), and it feels a little silly to build up all that sweat equity and then not use it to cover the debt we accrued in doing so. Additionally, we're in a pretty unique situation where my wife works for an airline, so we have a lot of incredible opportunities to travel. But, with our current credit card payment and tight budget, a lot of those opportunities are passing us by.

What do you guys think? I'm not worried about us building up another load of credit card debt -- it was a pretty unique thing that put us in this situation, and we've never had issues with spending otherwise. I'm usually a save-now-spend-later sort of guy, but I'm starting to feel like we could use the extra monthly cash now to spend on travel and more home-improvement projects. The alternative, for us, would be to move all our debt into home equity loan at about 4.125%. Is that a better plan? Am I missing anything?

Obligatory stats:

- Our current interest rate is 4.375%, and it looks like we could get refinanced for around 4.5% (4.627% APR). 

- We'd be taking our overall loan amount from $140k to about $160k.

- Our credit scores are excellent (right around 740, if I remember right). 

- We have one credit card that holds the entirety of our $15,000 debt at 6.81% APR.

personalfinance,ELI5: Is it better to pay $100/mo more toward mortgage or retirement?,"Explain like I'm 5: Is it better to pay $100/month more toward a mortage with a 4.25% fixed interest rate, or toward a retirement that pays 4% interest? And why?

My simple math skills says that it's better to pay money toward whichever pays/costs the higher percentage, whether that be an expense/debt or retirement. However, a financial adviser said to me in passing that it's not always better to do that for some reason. I don't know what that reason is.

I would personally prefer to have more debt paid off, in case of financial hardship - it'll be easier to navigate. But I don't understand the math, specifically, of how it could possibly be better to put money toward an IRA/retirement when I have debt that is at a higher interest rate.

Ryo is not an ICO,  they have an open source project.  
Ryo team is talking about an holistic currency that makes any individual a bank, and the system acts as a federal bank.  Calculating the money supply needed for a stable economy.  
A country like Venezuela  with no trust in the central bank might use such system to stable the economy. 
In Ryo each wallet has 2 tokens. 
1. Is the amount of money in the wallet.
2. Is the amount of trust the user has. 
They support inside chain lending (p2p) and can tell if the users returned the lendings gaining trust in the process. 
When you lend money you suggest an interest rate and the other user can accept it or not. 
Because if is all on the BlockChain you can see all other offers and know if the rate is fair. You get an open smart economy. 
It relay looks like a promising project.

personalfinance,22 yo / Saving 1000 Euro a Month / Please criticize my investemntplan,"Hi fellow investors,

I am currently planning on how to invest my 1000 Euro a month. I try to keep this as short as possible and as long as necessary.

Few words to my person. I am 22 years old, live in Germany and have just finished my studies. This means I am pretty early in my carrer and have plenty of time to invest and build sth.

The following plan is what I came up with after quite some time of researching.

Please give opinions, criticism and helpful advice.

I really appreciate your help and time! Thank you!

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Investmentplan for 1000 Euro a month**



**34% = 340 Euro**

**Stocks/Funds/ETFs**

This should be my fundamental investment which gives me longterm earnings through growing value and yearly dividends.

Also it is easy to withdraw in case of emergency. I am aware of the transactioncosts.

__________________________________________

**20% = 200 Euro**

**Crypto'currencies'**

I have started investing in BTC and ETH in November 2017 and would like to continue, as I think this will be a big thing sometime in the future. Still I am aware of the high risk and therefore put 'only' 20% in. Also it is easy to withdraw in case of emergency.

__________________________________________

**16% = 160 Euro**

**Riester Bausparer**

This is a government supported 'longtime' investment with the target of buying a home someday.

The Riester Bausparer (100K Euro) works like this. I deposit around 161 Euro a month, which ads up to 1932 Euro a year. This amount qualifies the Bausparer for the extra 175 Euro govermental support. When the Bausparer reaches round abour 40% of the maximum amount I can get my invested 40K Euro plus a credit of 60K Euro with a yearly interest rate of 1,6% (pretty ok i´d say). I plan to built/buy my own apartment or house partially with this credit.

Pros: Government money on top of my saving. Saving the low interest rates for the next decades.

Cons: Very low interest rate while depositing phase / 0.1%

_________________________________________

**30% = 300 Euro**

**Appartment as an investment / Price 210K Euro**

For this one I have to describe a bit more. For me the following is key in order to built a decent amount of value over time, without having to invest too much money and risk.

I plan to get a credit of round about 190K Euro. I bring 10% of the money for the appartment by myself (Necessary for the credit).

As I have basically no clue whats going on in the appartment owner business I plan to get an appartment which is easy to administrate. Just like an appartment within a multi-family-house (English?) with their own housekeeping and so on.

The credit should garantue a fixed interest rate for the next 15 years, as I plan to pay the 190K Euro back within this time.

The payback-plan looks like this. The tenant should pay a monthly rent of round about 700 Euro. This money should directly flow into te credit. I will add the initially mentioned 300 Euro. This ads up to 1000 Euro a month payback for the credit. Following this the credit is payed back after 15-16 years. Yearly additional paybacks not included yet.



\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Last words**

With this plan I am aiming for mid- to longterm value-creation with a nice diversification and little to mid risk. Also I am able to get 54% of the invested money back within 2 days if needed.

Now I am really interested in your thoughts and opinion. What do you like? What would you change? What is complete BS and what did I miss completely?

Thank you so much for participating in my future ;-)

investing,Timing the market,"(Also posted on r/investinguk)

After having had some success investing in cryptocurrencies I am looking to diversify my portfolio, as I am currently heavily weighted in crypto. I am looking to possibly invest in a couple of industry funds, indexes, bonds. For anyone who doesn't follow the crypto markets; they have taken an almighty beating lately, not that this has me particularly worried as I am still very much in the green. 

I know that this is pretty much a golden rule, ""don't try and time the markets"" but considering that the markets have been on a 10 year bull run, I am conscientious of jumping from the bottom of one market into the top of another (out of the frying pan, into the fire). Considering the recent interest rate hike, I am sure some consolidation or even a down turn could well be on the cards. 

As far as feeding my investments, I am looking to invest a lump sum and then on a rolling monthly basis, for the long term. To cut to the chase even with dollar cost averaging, is it perhaps foolish to be looking at this right now? Would the sensible investor perhaps be better to sit in cash wait things out for a bit?

personalfinance,"20K Loan Offer, what to do with it?","Hi,

 

I am currently confused with how to move forward in my current situation.

I’m being offered a 20K loan at 6.7% to be paid across 10 years. I currently owe 5.2K on credit cards with high interest rates in the mid 20s and owe 3 years on a car that’s payout is 16K with interest at 7.4%. I also owe my final class bill for 1800.

I’m trying to reduce my monthly expenses as I incurred a flood of emergency expenses and rent is really expensive.

 

These are my monthly bills:

Rent 1350

Car 450 7.4% interest owe total 16K

Insurance 190 (multiple services)

Phones 180

Internet Cable 70

Light 120

Credit Card Minimum Payments 150 24.74% interest owe total 5200

Plus Gas and food

Total monthly recurring expenses 2510

Current School Bill Owed 1800

I make roughly 2800 monthly

Current account balance 300

Recently I had to help cover medical expenses for family and I drained my emergency funds to do so and max my cards. I am now living paycheck to paycheck and I hate it. I used to have a family member stay with me and that was fine for a bit but I don’t want to have to depend on someone else and would like to cut costs in the short term. I should be advancing in my career and would prefer to pay off some debt later in life to be able to breathe now, I just received my master’s and should be moving forward within a year or so.

I know I want to get rid of the credit card payments ASAP as the payments are unnecessary expenses with no value.  Next is the car… I can’t refinance as my credit dropped to 630 with the cards situation and depleting checking account so I wouldn’t even be able to put money down.

What do I do? Should I take the loan and pay off credit cards, school bill, and car? If so how should I go about it? I’d pay off the cards and school right away so that would leave 12800. Should I set aside an emergency fund and put the rest towards the car? Should I wait until the card payments are reflected in my credit score and try to refinance? If I can get rid of the cards and car payments I would be in a really good position, I just don’t know how to go about it. I can’t really reduce the rent as that is low for my area and am close to my job. I can move a bit further out and save a maybe 200 bucks 300 if im extremely lucky but then I’ll have added gas and toll expenses, I live in front of my job so not much gas and tolls.

I finally after 11 months of being under-employed received a job offer making 36k and I have one more job interview tomorrow. The job interview tomorrow would be my top choice because it pays 45k and is a state job so I could make minimum payments on my student loans and have them forgiven in public service loan forgiveness in 10 years. So fingers crossed for that one. 

I currently have $600 in savings and I'm steadily building up my savings to the best of my ability for a 6 month emergency fund.

Once that's done, the only debt I have left is student loans.

I've been reading more books about financial literacy and trying to put myself on a path towards financial independence.

I want to work on the minimizing unrealized income by building a stock portfolio.

My highest interest rate loan is 6.8%. I know I need to get these off of my back, but it's going to take over half a decade minimum to do so before I can even start prioritizing my future financial stability if I go that route.

Currently we have 16k in the bank. Though 7.5k of that will go to the wife's fall semester tuition here soon.

Our end goal is to get a construction loan for our dream home. We are thinking cost of that will be 300k - 400k.

Our issue with the current long term plan is that our current neighborhood isn't the best for raising a kid and our half of the duplex is fairly cramped already.

I’m going through a bit of a transitional period in my life, and I think that the way I play games is going to be pretty affected by it also. While I do sincerely love the inclusion of indie titles to the PS4 Library, I also have some concerns if they’ll be future proofed or if they’d be locked to the console, especially with the majority of them being digital only. I should also note that a lot of the indies that I enjoy have been 2D side scrollers/ RPGs, so it’s safe to say that I understand my preference. 

I do love the exclusives that Playstation has to offer, but part of me is wondering if, especially with them being only digital, I should shift my indie gaming experience over to a PC. I’ve never been much of a PC gamer to be honest, and I’ve never really been too bothered if I was missing out on their exclusives (except for Cuphead, of course). However, with the future of consoles looking ambiguous after the most recent interview with Ubisoft, I’m wondering if I should keep investing in the digital library for Playstation, or if I should I hold out for a low-key gaming PC for my indie gaming experience, and more likely future proofing. Heck, I’d even be cool with playing indies on my MacBook Pro if it could handle them. 

Even so, I don’t plan on getting rid of my PS4 anytime soon, since it was a gift from a close family friend. I’m just thinking if I should space out my gaming options for the digital medium, or if I don’t need to worry about the PS Library’s future and go all in with the digital purchases. Any input you have on the matter would be most helpful, friends. Thanks.",technology

personalfinance,Predatory Auto Loan,"All right. I'm gonna start out by saying I'm super embarrassed to be in this position as I have done extensive research and waited a long time to buy a car so I would do it right! And I also work at a dealership and could have gotten a way better deal here. So, disclaimer, I went into the place I bought this car at (JD Byrider) when I was quite messed up on prescription pills and thought ""hey! today's the day i want to buy a car!"" My mom had recommended JD Byrider and my step mom went with me, so I thought it was ""fool proof"". Again, I was super messed up, but I guess not noticeably enough. I don't remember a lot of the dealings at the dealership.

So. I bought a 2004 Honda CRV with 148k miles from JD Byrider, fiananced through CNAC. This car is worth probably 5k at most. It's a good car, don't get me wrong, and I honestly really like it and think it will last me at least 5 years. I didn't do any research on the car or the price beforehand because JD Byrider's thing is that you come in and they run your credit and then show you vehicles you can ""afford"". So that was the one they showed me and I liked it so I took it and went to sign the papers.

Here's the real shitty part. After sobering up after a long weekend on Xanax, I looked over the papers I signed. I honestly just figured I paid 4 or 5k for this car. I had no recollection of the actual price. I do remember him showing me that my interest rate is 19.99%, and it is. Which is RIDICULOUS in and of itself, but I actually also have a pretty good credit score, but he said he couldn't offer me anything else. So I took it??? And I guess my step mom let me?? On top of that, if I paid no extra money each month and never refinanced my loan, the total cost of the vehicle would be 17k. Yes, 17k. The price of a new car, pretty much. The actual outright cost of the car is 10k. 

So, my question. How the HELL do I make this better for myself? I understand I can refinance but the companies I've called so far require a huge down payment on the loan because I'm obviously upside down. I am putting my student loans and my collection debt (also student related) on hold for now because obviously that interest rate is way lower and I need to pay off this car ASAP to make it even moderately less of a shitty situation. I bought the car on Friday, is there any recourse? I'm in Illinois if that helps. Sorry for the long post, I am just feeling really down and out about this.

personalfinance,Pay off mortgage or saving till refinance,"Hey all,

Ive recently purchased my first investment home with a high interest rate (only bank which lent me full amount) at 4.6%. The standard rate at the moment is 4% and i will be able to refinance in 2 years due to full time work. 

Ive heard of people saying ""save when interest rates are high and pay off when interest rates are low"". So i was wondering which would pay off more of the mortgage. 

By putting additional repayments into the house, approx 10k~ a year, 20k for the 2 years or putting it into my savings with a interest of 3.0% and then putting the savings into the mortgage once I refinance after 2 years (assuming still 4%).

crypto_currency,DCC And The Blockchain Infrastructures,"Presently there several types of loans and they include

Mortgage loan: in this type the credit collect is used to buy an asset. The asset bought is now serving has the guaranty incase the person did not fulfill it obligation by redeeming it the asset will be forfeited. This always happen within a stipulated period.

Unsecured loans: Unsecured loans are monetary loans that are not secured against the borrower’s assets. These may be available from financial institutions under many different guises or marketing packages such as credit card, debt personal loans bank, overdraft credit facilities or lines of credit corporate bonds, peer-peer lending

Demand loan: these are short-term loans that typically do not have fixed dates for repayment. However, it carries a floating interest rate which varies according to the prime lending rate or other defined contract terms. Demand loans can be ""called"" for repayment by the lending institution at any time. Demand loans may be unsecured or secured.

Subsidize loan: in subsidize loan the interest that is attached to the loan is always reduced to a very minimal amount. Either part of the interest is paid by government or an association.

Concessional: this is also known as ""soft loan"", is granted on terms substantially more generous than market loans either through below-market interest rates, by grace periods or a combination of both. This type of loans is mostly made by foreign governments to developing countries or may be offered to employees of lending institutions as an employee benefit.

However, all these loans have various challenges and sometimes very difficult to assess due to the fact that they are centralized. This results in people not attempting to get the loan even when they really need it. This challenge has been carefully studied by this great company called Distributed Credit Chain (DCC). Distributed Credit Chain (DCC) will use blockchain technology to disrupt the existing central system of credit disbursement by establishing a decentralized ecosystem for financial service providers around the world. It will empower credit with blockchain technology and returning ownership of data to an individual in a transparent way.

personalfinance,"Smart to buy house with cash, then get mortgage for full amount?","I'm going to be buying a home soon and I'm shopping around for financing. I would like advice on this scenario, since it's not something that comes up a lot.

I come from a moderately wealthy family. While I would never accept money for a house as a gift, they'd be happy to loan it to me for a few months.

Would it make sense to have them write me a check, find &amp; buy house, then take out some sort of cash-out loan / mortgage on that house to pay back my family? **Would I get a better interest rate if I did that than versus a regular mortgage?** (My logic is that I would have 100% equity in the home, so no risk for the bank) Is this even possible?

**Edit:** If I could get 80% back, that would be fine. The 20% would then be my down payment.  
**Edit 2:** Not paying back my family in full isn't an option. Not going to take a loan from them.

Any advice would be appreciated :) Thank you!",finance

personalfinance,Home Refi Conundrum,"Long time lurker, first time poster. Hoping for the hive mind's wisdom on this - i've gotten viewpoints from others, but PF is a font of great finance knowledge so I figure it's worth asking.

Considering a refi but I wanted to ask PF a couple of things. The main reason for the refi is to close our the last of our revolving debt. Doing so is going to clear everything except the house note. 

Current note is at 4.25%, refi is at 4.9% - taking about 25k out to pay bills. Highest interest rate is 24.99, lowest is 5.9. Those expenses account for about 570 a month in minimums, but we've killed a lot of it through belt tightening and paying extra. Impetus to get this done is a new kid arriving this winter, and the attendant day care charges that come with it. (When the kid arrives, DC will eat 90% of the remaining unspent money monthly)  


I know that my total overall burden will be lower on a monthly basis (payment goes up 200, but the 570/mo minimums on debt service go away) but even if the intent is to get out of an FHA mortgage into a conventional (which can't happen right now, score too low for conventional) in the medium term (2-3 years) am I missing something big on the back end as far as costs that could/should stop me from going this route?",finance

(Above $45,000) She’s never had a credit card, and every time she has applied she has been declined. She tried again today and the bank contacted her back saying she would either have to freeze 120% of the credit amount (in this case $500) or open a Tax Free Savings Account and leave it in there. 

She’s been paying rent, hydro bills and a cell phone bill for 3 years now. I’ve never heard of this before, and I’m wondering if it’s better she just try another bank or a company like Capital One (as high as their interest rates are I heard their approval rate is high.) 

Is it just the fact she doesn’t have any credit that is hindering her getting approved? Any information or advice would be really appreciated!",finance

Due to quite a bit of reckless spending and unwise decisions, I'm (25 years old) about $25,000 deep in credit card debt. I'm not sure what my options are as far as paying this off anymore. Below is (I believe) all the pertinent information. Any advice would be much appreciated.

Currently work a salaried job in retail management. $39,291 annual salary, take home $576 a week on my paycheck.

Credits cards consist of the following:

BofA credit card - $10,140 balance, 21.99% interest, $284 minimum payment

BofA credit card - $2,295 balance, no current interest rate, 16.74% starting 10/16/2018, $27 minimum payment

Citi diamond - $2,551 balance, no current interest rate, interest starting 10/2018, not sure of interest rate, $38 minimum payment

Citi simplicity - $1,729 balance, no current interest rate, interest starting 3/2019, $23 minimum payment

Chase credit card - $3,631 balance, 24.74% interest rate, $111 minimum payment

Discover - $6,784 balance, 24.74% interest rate, $133 minimum payment

Amex - revolving monthly balance of $21.55, paid off every month

Bills consist of the following:

Mortgage - $767.85

Car payment - $254, will be paid off 3/2019

Car insurance - $200

Water/gas/electric - $200-$250, depending on the time of year. In fall/spring, that can fall down to less than $100

Tv/internet - $200 (Comcast. I've tried calling and lowering the bill before, but it never lasts long and always creeps up to right around $200 a month)

Phone bill - $108, will go down to $82 in 2/2019

$25 transfer to savings account monthly to avoid BofA fees

Total take home monthly = $2304

Total bills including minimum payments on all cards = $2442

I feel like I'm drowning and I'm not sure where to go from here. I'm not even able to afford minimum payments anymore and I'm not even making a dent in my debt. Trying to negotiate raises at work isn't an option as I just received a promotion that took me from hourly to salary, and actually cost me money as I used to get overtime. I was considering filing for bankruptcy (I already have my home and car, and I'm not planning to try to take any loans out in the next few years), but I'd like to avoid that option if I can. I was also considering trying to take out a personal loan through Laurel Road that I could consolidate all my debt into and would probably give me quite a bit lower of an interest rate than the average \~22% I have on my credit cards. However, I'm unsure I could qualify for a personal loan as my credit score has taken quite a hit (\~622). I was considering a second part time job possibly overnights as well. Is there any option I am not thinking of? Is there any possible way to even pay this off? Any advice is appreciated.",finance

personalfinance,Student loans consolidated without knowledge/consent,"My girlfriend was recently checking her credit score and saw it took a huge hit due to some missed payments. Apparently she missed 7 payments on her student loans. She had set up autopay (with Navient) so we didn't know why there would be missed payments. It looked like her loans were with a different company now (FedLoan Servicing).

I initially thought her loans were sold which I heard was common. After contacting FedLoan, they said it wasnt sold but her loans were consolidated and that it had to be authorized by her. She doesn't recall anything like that. We requested a copy of the consolidation loan application which was apparently done online at studentloans.gov. A lot of the information like her address/phone/email was wrong. I googled the address on the application and its for a company called Nationwide Debt Direct LLC. After googling them, they look a bit shady. 

We called the fraud department at studentloans.gov and they basically said we had to call FedLoan and ask for the missed payments to be removed (which we already did before and they told us to open a fraud complaint). Any idea why this happened and if there is anything we should do besides filing a fraud report with the credit bureaus and FedLoan? Thanks",finance

Background information: I just graduated university in May, and started a position in banking a month or so after. I accrued ~$25k in federal student loans (varying in size and rate between 3.7-4.6%) and have another ~$33k in essentially interest-free loans from my parents, which is obviously a very lucky situation. I'm getting paid very well for someone who is still 21, with all-in compensation that could easily approach $120k for the first 12 months of work.

I was wondering what you all think my priority should be as far as setting up deductions into a retirement account (just set up my plan with 6% Roth and 4% standard pre-tax deductions, with company match up to 6% total), paying off debts, etc. My current plan is to funnel as much money as I can into the interest-bearing debt while giving my parents smaller monthly payments, as they're willing to cut me some slack. Once I'm free from all or most of the interest-bearing loans, crank up my savings rate and start paying larger sums to my parents. If that's not a good way to go about this, I'd really appreciate some wisdom prior to getting too far down this road.

financialindependence,Would you sacrifice lifestyle for a big signing bonus?,"I recently encountered a situation that made me consider the actual dollar value of having control over my working life.  I'm 99% sure I know what my decision will be, but I figured I'd throw it out for discussion since it hits some common dilemmas in this community.  

I'm a veterinarian who does relief work - aka locums or being a substitute vet.  I contract to fill in with clinics who are short staffed.  The change from being a regular employee of a clinic has been wonderful, and it has allowed me to take big chunks of time off for pursuing personal goals (mostly long distance hiking) while still making a good salary.  I'm planning to move in a few months and have just started lining up work in the new state.  My old employer is a large corporation that has a significant presence in the new city.  They offered a signing bonus equivalent to 30-40% of my annual salary if I sign a 2 year full time contract with them.  This was tempting, as I didn't hate working for them, the benefits are good, and the bonus could go straight to stocks or the down payment on an investment property.  There are definitely some aspects of working for a large corporation that I disliked and would have to suck it up and deal with if I took the position, but over all it wouldn't be terrible.  My salary outside the bonus would be equivalent or slightly less than what I can make now after equalizing hours worked and accounting for the additional costs of self employment.  

I'm currently in a good financial position (no debt, 40-50% savings rate despite only working 8-9 months per year the last few years).  I estimate I can hit FI in 7-10 years if I continue my current lifestyle of spending a few months traveling and volunteering each year and working hard the remainder of the year.  This would be more like 5 years if I worked full time with only 2-3 weeks/year off to boost savings.  However, I really like my lifestyle now.  I get to make my own schedule, work in a variety of practice settings, and don't have to ask anybody for permission when I want time away.   I enjoy the challenge of adapting my practice style to different clinics and teams every day.  While I plan to do less paid work and get pickier about the contracts I accept after FI, I don't really feel the need to sacrifice the current lifestyle in order to hit a magic number faster.  The bonus would take maybe a few months off of my FI date. 

So - I'm thinking about it, but I'm probably going to turn the offer down and continue my current gig.  I've said repeatedly that I will never go back to being an employee, but this was enough money to at least make me consider.  If it were 80% of my annual salary or a shorter commitment, the answer would probably be yes.  What would you do in a similar situation?  Would you sacrifice a little bit in lifestyle for 2 years in exchange for a cash infusion that would put you a few months closer to FI?",finance

Because of this one of the accounts has been closed until I pay the late payments and bring it up to current. Which I think I will be able to this month and the beginning of next month
3. I basically pay and the balance remains the same after the monthly interest rate.  What are my options apart from just paying more? Is there an option out there were I combine the money owed and just make one payment? (This would help.) 
4. I want a plan that helps me do this and also fixes/raises my credit.

I am going to defer some income to the start of next year as I usually do, but obviously I'll have to pay taxes on that money *next* year so it's not a long-term solution.

As a self-employed individual, I have to pay the Federal tax rate (currently at the top end of the 12% bracket) plus the 15.3% self-employment tax and another 7.4% to my state. 

* I work as a sole proprietorship.
* I have no dependents. 
* I've looked into S-Corps but the way I'll have to file is complicated and obviously it's too late for 2018 at this point (if you think it's worth it for 2019, please share).

I live at home (no rent), but bought a car and will be paying $400/month for the next 5yrs. I have two kinds of student loans: 50k in my name and 100k in parent plus loans. The interest rate is about 7-8% between the two. Using a calculator, if I put all my income to the debt, I'd pay it off in 4 years. I am eligible for PSLF but only for the loans in my name. I would earn more over time, of course, but I don't know how much for sure. 

If I were to get a Masters degree (it would be a nurse practitioner MSN), it would cost me another 35k in student loans. So 185k total plus interest. I have been accepted to a program, and my salary after would be 80-90k (65-70k after taxes). So I could put 3-4k towards my loans each month and also pay them off in 4 yrs.

personalfinance,How to best proceed through several money moves in the most beneficial way?,"Hello, I am a 23 y/o on a stable Net-income of 2500/month. My monthly bills include basic nessesities, a car lease (600$) and credit card/personal loan debts ($9500 / 250min/month) adding up to roughly 1250, or half of my monthly wages. These bills do not include rent in any way, as I am living with grandperents rent free to take care of my siblings. However, I now really desire my own house for myself and my girlfriend, and have decided to start the homebuying process. Although i am in a worrysome amount of debt, i have never missed payments and have a decent score of 650. 

 I am ready to bite the bullet and admit my car lease was a mistake, and am going to return it for a much more reasonable vehicle for my income level. It has caused my credit debt to spiral out of control over the last 2 years.  My dealership offers a leasebuyout program since i have less than 12 months remaning (10), as long as I buy or lease another vehicle from their lot, which is reasonable. This should help me manage my credit card debt, which is starting to feel more and more like a losing battle. But i also really need a house soon for my own sanity and relationship with my girlfriend. I am unsure the best route of action to take. I want the best possible interest rate on my home loan and car loan/lease. But am sure that both of these will drastically effect my score. Which one should come first? And would it be benefical for me to take out some kind of debt consolodation loan, removing my balances on my highest interest rate cards for a much lower flat interest rate? If so, should this loan be taken out before or after the homebuying process? 

Also, any advice you think would be relevant to my situation would be greatly apprieictaed. I may have not been the smartest with my money to begin my adulthood, but I determined to turn things around for myself and family. 

Thank you! :)

personalfinance,"800$ a month payment on 54,000$ 'FAFSA' loan for college","My fiance just graduated and her parents took out loans to pay for school, she agreed to pay this back verbally. The loans are apparently parent plus loans on a 25 year schedule, totalling 54k. She graduated in May and her parents are telling her the payment due on these loans is 800$ a month and starts due in November. This seems high to me and before the sixth month grace period for start of payment..

To clarify she has Stafford loans in her name at the cost of 27k. She went to an in state public school with tuition in the 15k range. She also was informed that some of her living expenses were included on this FAFSA loan, I don't think this is possible. She also had a job all four years and covered some of her living expenses, it was a federal sponsored work study program.Her parents have claimed that they put 20k into her loans already which doesn't seem possible. So I'm really unsure about these loans for a couple reasons


1. I used time value of money to calculate the loan payment for 6.5% interest, got this from FAFSA website. The payment came out to be less than 400 a month. To get 800 a month on this principal you would have to be at a 18% interest rate which is absurd. It can't possibly be this high if backed by the government.

2. Her parents refuse to supply an itemized list of the expenses on this list, she's asked and they won't provide it. Instead they say they'll walk her through their loan payment portal. To me this is sketchy, they need to provide her with this information for login so we can go through them together.

3. This may be better for r/relationships but her dad becomes extremely combative and angry whenever questioned by her about the specifics of the loan. To me this is indicitave of this not being entirely her loan, they are trying to have her pay for things she didn't accrue.

4. She has the previously mentioned Stafford loans in her name as well, these adding together seems extremely high for her education cost. Her parents claim to have paid ~20k on her education already, I don't believe this, it would be 100k+ plus for her education to an instate school.

5. They have previously pressured her to refinance these in her name, saying consolidating in her name reduces the monthly payment. This could be true but pressuring to take debt into her name without telling her the specifics is to me, very sketchy and at all costs should not be done.

6. They are additionally pressuring her to pursue her master's right away as the loans will defer until she completes the degree. They are trying to  dissuade her from even thinking about working and paying off what's in her name first. We are moving and will need a year to establish residency to get in state tuition and I proposed working for a year and paying these off, we can easily pay off the 27k in her name in a year with our jobs, while waiting for residency. Her parents when informed got EXTREMELY combative and berated her for days about this being a bad decision for our future. Are they correct?

So my solution is to not engage with them and tell them they are in their name and she isn't paying. Is this a valid course of action? I'm really looking for all insights on this as I'm trying to wrap my head around what exactly isn't being told by her parents. Thanks for any help you can provide.",finance

token,TSE: who participates and to whom benefits.,"***TSE*** is the newest tool for raising funds, a financial-profitable process for each Party (Business - User - the founder company of a token), which is not subject to regulation by a single country. It is possible that this was the reason for winning the status of ""Branch of world significance""..

The sale of tokens or, as it is customary to call in the crypto society - the [Token Sale Event](https://nyigde.com/en/blogs/ieshtchie-bolshie-bonusow-na-pre-token-sale-event-845.html), is conducted by start-ups and established companies with the purpose of crowdsale, for the implementation of further strategic plans. Often, the tokens sell at the development stage, or when the platform is already functioning and fully accessible to users, but on global development and active expansion of own funding is not enough.

TSE regularly conducts a huge number of projects. Someone, in the end, will be weaker, and the amount collected for advertising will not reach even the bottom mark, someone is stronger, and the company's tokens are bought at the time of the first presale.

Why do companies massively go to a TSE? The riddle? No, rather, finding an easy way to achieve a financial goal without obligations to the law: you do not need to show income, have reserve capital, pay deductions and conduct a thorough audit. Moreover, it is not necessary to have specialists with a diploma in the team. Comply with a number of rules, of course, it is necessary, but there is no responsibility for crypto-activity as such. All, as they say, ""on conscience"".

Now let's talk about profitability. High volatility prevents the determination of prices, and to understand in which direction the token is moving (profit / loss) is almost impossible. People buy tokens with a single purpose: to earn on the tokens. And why not, [if it is very profitable](https://nyigde.com/en/blogs/token-nyigde-kak-garant-bezopasnosti-807.html):

📷 the size of the investment is almost minimal.  
📷 the ability to monitor operations 24/7.  
📷 profit even from possession of 1 token.  
📷 sale at any time.

The profit from buying / reselling is a very real process, but with the presence of features:

**\*** When buying tokens, the user should understand that he is making a long-term investment, because this is where the whole charm of earnings lies. Let's say the price of the token at the start is $0.35. And is clear what to sell for the same cents... where is the logic and what's the point, if the profitability is 0%? But after a couple of months, he can go up to $6.2 for 1 token. That's quite another matter, you can sell. The more demand for a token, the more valuable it is, but it takes time. Examples on the same principle are enough: the TaaS token grew fivefold in five weeks, *BAT* cost only $0.036 and rose to $0.24. *GNO* rose in price by 4, *EDG* \- exceeded expectations and increased to 500%.

**\*** Buying a token on presales brings basic and additional bonuses, which in the total amount can make a profitability of up to 70%, 100% or even more. Depends on the interest rate from the project, but the more you buy tokens, the more% drips into your wallet. Buying tokens after the termination of TSE, often, does not give bonuses, therefore it is very important to have time to buy a token at the first stages of the sale. For example, if a user has bought 1000 tokens and % of bonuses is 15, then 150 tokens are credited with a freebie. In our case, the bonus TSE program from buying tokens looks like this:

* buying from **100** to **3 000** **NYIGDE** tokens, we charge the user **10%** of bonuses.
* from **3 000** to **10 000** tokens we give **20%** of bonuses.
* The purchase from **10 000** to **100 000** is accompanied by **30%**.
* **100 000-500 000** tokens brings to the Buyer **40%** of bonuses.
* from **500 000** \- charge **50%**,** VIP-bonu**s.

Figures, interest rates speak for themselves. They form an understanding that the benefit from TSE is extracted by both Parties, both the User and the start-up, the company. There is no need to think-guessing, it's enough to persuade people to look through crypto-sources, which are full of illustrative examples... there are many examples. Ethereum itself started from $0.2, and today $300. Here you have a direct proof. Do not be afraid to buy tokens, you just need to understand the principles, mechanisms of work, learn the analysis of the block-project. We wish you a worthy purchase and a huge profit!

personalfinance,Is a Credit Card Consolidation Loan Worth It?,"Hello Helpful PF Redditors!

I have kind of a general inquiry here about unsecured loans. I am currently applying for one thru a OneMain financial and the proposed (my application isn't totally complete yet) interest rate is 24%. For consolidation purposes, this high (right?) rate would actually be helpful just because it will reduce my 3 CCs (each over 24%) to 1 and hence lower my overall payments toward the debt.

But my question is this: is it very likely that I would be able to find a lower rate on an unsecured loan? I don't have a car, and that's all they care to use as collateral (and I'm a renter – I don't actually don't own anything of real value anyway), so I'm SOL for landing a secured loan. I know ads for these loans are a bunch of hype, but I saw SoFi suggesting a rate as high as 16%. Is that real or are they just trying to rope me in? I don't want to put applications in all over the place for fear of my credit score rising. It's currently in the 720s and I've fought tooth-and-nail for that score, having built it up after being a general idiot in my 20s.

Some other financial details: my total CC debt is around $8,500. I accrued it within the past couple of years, having to use them as a crutch during a time when not-great financial decisions mixed with unexpected expenses. I live more-or-less paycheck to paycheck. But I've recently been working within a tight budget to pay these CCs down as fast as I can. It seem like I can't afford to pay them down faster than the interest catches up to me, though. That's why I'm trying to consolidate them and stop using them altogether. (I also have a lot of student loan debt that paying off is just plain Sisyphean.)

So I guess I have another question: Is a consolidation loan the best course of action here, or am I buying into the advertising?",finance

This is the second year I am taking out a MN SELF loan and accepting the Federal Direct loans, which means already one year into college and I have \~25,000 worth of debt to pay off with no job... I'm on track to graduate in 4 years with a Software Engineering degree as well as a Math minor and User Experience minor. I have a 3.9 GPA (which is way above average for my school) and I really enjoy my schooling.

I write for 3rd-party scholarships constantly (via [scholarship.com](https://scholarships.com)) but have been unable to been rewarded with any so far, but I will continue. Also I have filed as an independent on my taxes for the past 2 years so hopefully the FAFSA next year will award me more, but it's probably not likely. 

**My Conundrum** 

Now let's assume the worst and say that to finish my degree at this school I have to continue to take out the same loans every year, meaning at the end of my degree I'd have \~100,000 worth of loans. According to my schools website most SE graduates start with a salary of \~65,000 right out of school. Assuming I'm lucky and talented enough to land a job like that, according to the different loan calculators online, I would not be able to pay off these loans in 10, 15, or 20 years. When the issue of loans comes up in conversations with my friends from what I can tell they've only borrowed about 6,000 for their first year and are already lamenting paying those off and I feel embarrassed to say that I had to take out loans 4x theirs just for my first year alone. There's a pit in my stomach just thinking about it so I have to ask myself, am I making a mistake? When applying for loans last year I was able to write it off in my conscious because the mid-career salary for SE's is \~100,000 and I used that to justify my stupidity but now I just don't know. I've pour over this subreddit constantly and on every occasion I see there horror posts of people with 100,000+ loans and no way to pay them off. I feel like if I continue that'll be me in 4 years time so if I can stop it now or be smart now maybe I won't be in such a terrible situation. The things is I want to continue my education at my college if possible. But part of me thinks that it's just not sustainable, so I come to you guys seeking your advice, experience and know-how. Any response is highly valued.

personalfinance,"Second Year College Student. What options do I have to pay ~3,000 dollars of students loans per semester, outside of PLUS loans?","I am in a unique situation. My parents make over 100,000 dollars, but are not helping me pay for college. This disqualifies me for \~half of my federal loans, and removes the Pell Grant option. Luckily, I was able to get a 9000 dollar scholarship, but that still leaves around 9000 dollars in college loans. I took out as many federal loans as I could, but that leaves me with about 6000 left to cover for the year. My parents will not take out a PLUS loan to help with this amount.

What options do I have to get this money for schooling? If possible, I do not want  an insanely high interest loan, but I understand that due to my situation that may be unavoidable. I'm slightly panicking, so any help you could offer would be phenomenal. I've looked through the sidebar, but haven't really found any answers for my particular circumstance.

What would be the best way to invest these savings ?,"I’m 19 , I live in Europe and have zero debt ( no student loan or anything). The money was given to me when I reached my 18th birthday and now it’s sitting in my personal account with about 0,8% p.a. Interest. However on my 20th birthday which is going to be this December It will be 2 years since I moved the money to that account and I will have to decide if I want to move it somewhere else, invest it or whatever. I do not need the money at the moment as I am still studying and will live at the campus or my parents house and my business is generating me a pretty solid income.

Current interest rates at my local banks and some others as well are not really interesting, compared to what interest rate I have at the moment anyway. Current rates are about 0,3% which is just stupid and I feel like theres no point in doing this.

personalfinance,"Currently $120,000 in debt, will likely be ~$160,000 by the time I start making money. Would like some tips!","Alright so, as the title says, i'd like some tips from you finance gurus. I mostly think I know what I need to do, but wouldn't mind some guidance either.

I just turned 28. Growing up, i've essentially had little to zero debt, always paid off credit cards as soon as charges hit. I don't like debt so I'm very motivated to get rid of it. It was drilled into me as a child not to buy anything you can't pay in full immediately. However, 1.5 years ago I started a graduate program with essentially $0 in savings (I had a low paying job and had just finished paying off undergrad, and spent some to enjoy myself before getting back to work).

With my expensive grad program, I have been essentially living off credit cards in between loan disbursements. Currently, I have one credit card maxed out at $9,000, and have a $2,500 balance on my other card. I also have $109,000 in federal loans. That will increase to $123,000 next month when this coming semester's disbursement releases.

With whatever is left over from disbursement (should be around $9,000), should i just put that straight to my credit card, and essentially restart the cycle until next loan disbursement releases 3 months later?

I currently live in an expensive area, but am working on changing it so I can move back in with parents until I graduate, at which point i'll have a job paying upwards of $10X,XXX right out of school. I would be able to live with them rent free.

I have 5 federal loans, with an average interest rate of 6.5%. Credit card rates averaging 20%.

I am fortunate in that my parents have done well for themselves, and will be selling a large asset in the coming months. They have offered to help with my loans and for me to pay them back with 0% interest. Would it be best to take all of that lump sum and put it towards federal loans, or only use a portion and to keep a certain amount of cash on hand to get out of living on credit cards?

Sorry for the lengthy post but I appreciate all your help. Situation is a little disheartening as my credit score has taken a beating this year, going from 800 to a low of 710 today. Happy to answer any questions or clarify anything.",finance
personalfinance,"Help me decide to recast, prepay a lump sum, or invest in index fund.","My situation originally started out very straightforward.  Bought a new house and later sold previous house.  I only put 5% down on a $350,000 house, which I have a loan of $332,500 with at Conventional 30 Year, 7/1 ARM at Interest Rate of 3.875% and APR of 3.262%.  I was going to recast using the profits from selling my previous house.  I was going to put 52,000-60,000 towards principal, which would put me over 20% and remove PMI which is $113.60 per month.  This saves about $26,000 over the life of the loan.  After reading and reading, I am more confused than ever, and seems the options are endless. 

I am 36, I make $100,000 annually, have no debts other than mortgage, I have an emergency fund, I am putting 7.5% with employer match towards 401k.

From reading, I know general thinking is that paying towards principal should be next step unless I can get better than a 3.875% interest on investment.  Which got me looking into buying shares in an index fund like the S&amp;P 500, which is something like 7%(not guaranteed of course) on recent average, from what I read.  

I have also used a calculator apply the lump payment of 55,000 to my balance owed, while still allowing me to continue to make my current payment amount, and it saves $62,653.72 which is almost triple the savings,  but this would be very tough to do each month and not sure if I can commit to that.  

It seems that recasting is the safest bet its just sickening to know I am knowingly giving away an additional ~$36,000 over the life of my loan.  Having this amt of money($60,000 from net proceeds) at my disposal is a once and a lifetime opportunity and I want to make the most of it.

personalfinance,Suggestions/advice for a financial late bloomer,"Due to some poor life choices, a shitty decade long relationship and overall laziness I am far behind the curve when it comes to someone my age (38) and my financial health. I’m hoping for advice from where to go from my current situation.

My salary is about $39,000/year. My current debt is a car loan with a $7000 balance and a 3.9% interest rate and a home mortgage with a $47,000 balance and a 4.29% interest rate. I have no credit card debt and my credit score is an admirable 821. My 401K is at $16,700 and I contribute the 6% that my employer matches 25% of. I have an emergency savings account with about $8,000 into which I deposit $200 biweekly. I’m feeling pretty confident in the emergency savings amount now and I’m at a loss of where to go from here. I know the next step is probably opening a Roth IRA? Are there other things I should be doing that I'm missing?  The $200 I’ve been depositing into the emergency fund is pretty much the max I can do without getting a raise or cutting my current, fairly cushy, lifestyle. I live in the Midwest so the cost of living isn’t very high. I could probably up it slightly though…

I guess I’m just looking for some direction and suggestions on where to go from here.",finance
personalfinance,Would it be stupid to cash out my 4 years worth of 401k to get us out of a few jams while I'm unemployed?,"Short version: Lost my job 3 months ago. Credit card debt has been accumulating, now totaling $7,000 over the past 18 months. Had a 401k plan that [says](https://imgur.com/a/fM1tUro) if I cash out now, I'll get $22,000 of my $31,000 (more than I thought after penalties). I have a wife and 3 kids.  We are living with my parents for free as long as we want. I am 30. 

Long version: Worked 4 years at a job in a very high cost city, living as cheaply as possible, thinking we could live paycheck to paycheck just a little longer until I got a better job that allowed us to finally start saving. Better job never happened, my job ended, and now we've moved back home to a low cost-of-living state where we can live for free with my parents while I find a new job. Our credit card debt started adding in up in the last year after we had to move to a new place that was slightly cheaper but the utility costs were hundreds of dollars a month more than we were expecting (old drafty house, ugh.) So where we were just scraping by before, we started running a balance month to month over the past 18 months and it has snowballed to $7k, our recent cross country move costing about 3k of that. 

One of my biggest concerns is the recent decline of my previously excellent credit score. In in January of 2017 it was in the low 760s ""Excellent"" and it has gone down to 721 ""Good"" as of today. The different creditwise, credit karma, etc. each showing a general decline in the past year dropping a few points each month since we had to start only paying off the minimum payment of our credit card. I assume the longer I keep this growing balance, the faster the score will drop. 

We are thrifty by nature and upbringing and I know the best thing is to put as much into your 401k as your company will match/allow and to never think about using the money. And I didn't at first. But now that it's been a few months without any real income (My wife works a little job that brings in a few hundred dollars a month, that's basically paying for food and student loan/credit card minimum right now) that 22k is looking really tempting. I've heard you only get a small fraction of your 401k if you cash it out early, so I was surprised when their letter said I'd get 22k of my vested 31k. Does that seem correct and will I be kicking myself when we're 70 and this money could have grown a lot? 

Our current plan is for me to apply to a masters program in my field and get an actually well-paying job 3 years from now (If I am accepted, I would start in Fall of 2019 and it's a 2 year program). Before you say ""More school won't solve your problem!"", I know why you'd say that but I also know this program well and it's incredibly cheap and known for placing it's graduates in great jobs. I would never consider a typical gradschool as the debt is not worth the benefit. After scholarships and several other advantages, the total cost of my program will only be around 6k for tuition and we'd live free with my parents the whole time. So I am currently looking for any old job with insurance for just the next year until I would start my master's program. 

So my big question is, **am I crazy to tap into this money now when we really need it rather than leaving it be until retirement?** (I do expect to be working a good job in 3 years from now where I would start a new 401k and heavily invest in it to make up for the lost 4 years.)  **And if so, how does all that work? Does the retirement company just send a check?** All at once? Do they give you the whole amount and you are required to pay the penalties when you file your taxes the next year? Or do they only give you the 22k and the rest is withheld? 

And, could I avoid the early withdrawal penalties if I used the money to pay for grad school? How do they confirm I'll use it for gradschool? Does it have to only cover tuition, do I have to be accepted first? I'll only need about 6k of it for tuition. Would love to pay off my remaining undergraduate debt too, about $11k, that we are fine paying $140 a month right now. It's a fed loan so the interest is not that bad, and I understand there are disadvantages to paying it off too quickly, but I've never understood that strategic debt stuff. 

So please be kind, the past six months have been really hard on me and my family and I've never had a good grasp of ""grown up"" finances like investing, retirement planning, and compound interest-type stuff. 
Thanks for reading.

btc,Let's focus on technology &amp; adoption. That's what matters.,"Dear community,

Don't get distracted by the drama, focus on making BCH the best form of money and spread adoption since this is what truly matters in the mid to long run. The goal of Bitcoin is to free humanity from bankers and fiat printing out of thin air. 

When the next global recession hits, current financial system will get wiped out since none of the fundamental problems were solved after 2008. Interest rates are very low so the only way to boost economy will be to print a lot of fiat money leading to hyper inflation. Humanity needs an alternative means of exchange which is also resistant to inflation. This is the time when BCH can thrive, protect wealth and reach all time high valuations since it's meant to be used by both poor and rich and is capable of scaling.

By contrast, BTC is likely to struggle in crisis times when huge influx of new users start joining the space leading to high fees and bad user experience. It's not capable of handling more than 300k transactions per day without massive fees.

The business cycle is in the last phases before changing the trend and diving down. Give it 1-2 years and we will see fireworks when BCH goes truly mainstream due to uncertainty in world's economy.

So we need to prepare for those times when banks go bust and huge influx of users happen. Let's focus on technology and adoption. Respect each other and collaborate since we are all in the same boat. We all need Bitcoin to work well and be useful when recession hits. This is the goal of Bitcoin as implied by the message in the genesis block.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,[TN] Dealer possibly lied to us about interest rate. What can we do?,"My wife and I (23) recently bought our first car. We originally applied for a loan with our local bank, but despite having a +750 credit score were denied because a lack of credit history.  We found a car we wanted, applied for financing with a local credit union through the dealership, and were given a rate that matched the bank's as long as I brought in check stubs proving employment. No problem.

While we sold our old car privately, the car we applied for sold from under us and we couldn’t find another so we went to a different dealership (Toyota)  that had another make and model we were interested in. We found a good deal and went with it. 

This is where things get muddy.

We told the dealer that we had been approved by the credit union previously with another dealer, but since it was a week earlier they told us we had to apply again. They came back and told us that we had been approved, but since we were first time buyers we were put in a high risk category and our interest rate with the credit union would be higher than if we financed through their dealership. We went with what they said and planned on refinancing once we built more credit history.

I called the credit union today and double checked on the high risk category. The customer service person immediately told me that it sounded like they were misleading us. After he looked into our information he said he saw nothing about us being in a high risk category. However, he was not a loan officer and encouraged me to call back after asking for the name of the dealership so he knew not to shop there.

I am planning on calling back tomorrow, but until then I am trying to find out if:

1: If it is likely they lied to us

2: Is there anything we can do to lower our interest rate without refinancing with someone else? (papers are signed but no payments have been made)

TLDR; Auto-Dealer told us we were in a high risk category with local credit union. After financing through their dealership, credit union told us that they may have lied to us.

personalfinance,Questions About What to Do With Remaining Budget?,"Found out recently there is a very real possibility we will be moving across country in a year.

However, I already have sizable debt, and basically nothing in savings (401k aside of course, but I’m not contributing enough).

I’ve recently started looking at a bunch of difference PF apps (Mint, Personal Capital, YNAB, Albert, Cleo), in an attempt to get serious about this. I haven’t picked one to stick with long term, but they are helping, and I have decided to at least attempt to take the mindset from YNAB for now.

I’ve come up with half a budget and questions for the rest.

# The landscape:

* $4000 a month take home pay (bi-weekly)
* $50,000 in Federal Student Loans (3.5 - 6.5% interest)
* $14,000 auto loan financed at 10% (originally \~18,000)
* About $5,900 in Credit Card debt
   * 6 cards ranging in interest from 22%-27%
   * Balances are $0, $300, $240, $500, $900, $3900
   * $0 balance card pays the internet bill every month and gets paid in full to keep it active
   * Utilization is very high, 5/6 cards maxed out or nearly so.

Static Expenses

* Rent: $500
* Utilities &amp; Internet: \~ $310
* Student loan payment: $195
* Car Payment: $363
* Credit Card Minimums - $305
* Cell Phone - $100
* Streaming subscriptions - $80
* Insurance (Renters/Car): \~ $100
* Yoga membership: $85
* Gas: \~ $50

Total: $ 2088

Leaving $1900 to work with. Mint has revealed to me that in the past few months I have spent an absurd amount on shopping, groceries, and restaurants, so I have set much more conservative budgets for those this month, $200, $400, $300 respectively. 

Shopping includes necessities like trash bags, dog food, and light bulbs, this month I’m going to track these in a separate category to see how much this should really be.

Even if I don’t keep YNAB I plan to adjust the budgets if I go over on one and take it out of the other.

Streaming subscriptions is a clear spot where I could make some additional changes. Talking with the SO tonight about canceling some and going down to $40 a month, or splitting the costs. I’m also going to look into a local company that might be able to get me a better cell phone rate. Also restaurants is likely to get more slashing, but I didn’t want to cut it more than in half the first month so I can see what feels realistic. I work downtown and enjoy happy hours with coworkers.

After that there is $1000 a month. If there is extra from those 3 budgets they get added to this one.

It should be noted that I have about $600 in unavoidable expenses due right now (property taxes, medical bills, etc), so the plan for what to do with the rest is a bit impaired at the moment. Realistically this will take shape in September.

# Here’s the questions though

1. How to I divide up that $1000 to best meet my goals?

I have all this debt, my credit score is kind of in the toilet only because of my credit card utilization, and but at the same time I need to be saving in case this move actually happens. If it does it won’t be optional, it will be for a job (not mine) and moving expenses may/may not be covered.

So realistically in one month I can pay off (or close to it) 3/5 cards. By the end of the year I can certainly have all but the big guy paid.  But the big guy is the highest interest, so should I be working on him first instead? According to Mint I could pay them all off by March of next year, but that doesn’t account for saving extra money for the moving fund? Should I even be saving for the moving fund while I have a pile of credit card debt, even though some expenses will be unavoidable (moving truck and rental deposit, namely)?

2. If I pay off all the credit card debit, my credit score should rise considerably. So then should I try to refinance the auto loan at a better rate?

3. Should I also try to save for an Emergency fund? How much should I realistically save if I’m already saving to move?

Any insight is greatly appreciated. Thank you.",finance
financialindependence,Safe Withdrawal Rates vs. Spending and Policy Uncertainty,"33/M/Single.  If I FIREd today, my first-year withdrawal rate would be a very safe &lt;3% because:

* **Taxes:**  Most of my assets are in Roth accounts and taxable accounts with high cost bases and most of my income would be dividends and capital gains.  Therefore, taxes (both federal and state) would consume no more than 5% of my withdrawals even if I started a Roth conversion ladder with my small traditional IRA.
* **Healthcare:**  I'm young and healthy and would likely qualify for substantial ACA tax credits.
* **Housing:**  My rent is a couple hundred dollars a month below market because I snagged a rent-controlled apartment at the right time.

On the other hand, I expect my expenses to rise much faster than inflation over the first 25-30 years because:

* **Taxes:**  The government's running huge deficits, so the favorable rates on dividends and capital gains may go away.  Furthermore, my investments will have hopefully appreciated, so a larger portion of my withdrawals will be gains rather than cost basis.
* **Healthcare:**  I'll be getting older and there's tremendous uncertainty around ACA subsidies.
* **Housing:**  If I ever want/need to move for any reason or if rent control laws change, I'll be forced to start paying market rent.

If I assume that (1) 15% of my withdrawals are going to taxes due to hypothetical-but-plausible tax hikes, (2) I'm paying market rent and (3) I'm paying the health insurance premiums of a 60-year-old instead of a 33-year-old and without ACA credits, my annual expenses go up to 4.3% of my portfolio.  Given current market valuations, that's too high for me to sleep well at night.

On the other hand, my expenses would rise gradually and the fact that my expenses would be highest relatively late in the game gives my portfolio a lot of time to grow at very low withdrawal rates to meet them.  How does one adequately model this complexity and determine whether their portfolio is really sufficient for FIRE?",finance
personalfinance,"Please help this young attorney dig out of this debt hole... I am clueless about money and don't even know where to start! Credit cards and student loans, savings and loans, what do I do?","m a longtime Redditor but using a less-used alt account because this is deeply personal and embarrassing. I feel really ashamed and constantly wondering about how everyone around me manages their money, how people would see me if they knew my secret, etc., and I'm finally ready to ask for help. 

I have several debts currently and although I desperately want to get out of debt (as much as possible; I know my student loans arent going anywhere anytime soon), I just don't know how! I know about the avalanche method vs snowball, but I'm not sure how to account for the other potential factors (like savings or a personal debt consolidation loan, etc.) when trying to weigh everything out. 

I'll list everything I can think of and hopefully I will get some good advice. I don't have anyone I can ask...

I'm 33, single, female, and a practicing attorney; I have been for about 6 years now. I work for a county though, so I don't make that much. After taxes and pension are deducted, $54,974.88 is what's deposited in my account annually. 

My main issue is credit cards. I'm terrible with money and should not have a credit card except one of keep in the freezer for emergencies, I have come to realize. However, having that epiphany doesn't really help me dig my way out currently. Here are my accounts:

1. Chase Sapphire: $9,845.88 @ 24.24% interest rate
2. Chase Freedom: $1,791.78 @ 24%
3. Capital One: $1,081.99 @ 7.9%
4. Bank of America: $4,164 @ 0% (promo)*

*The BoA card I got as a balance transfer, I was hoping to transfer all of the Sapphire balance to it but BoA's limit was $5k, so I couldn't transfer all of it. The 0% promo expires in November and then the rate will go up to 24%.  I would like to avoid paying back interest on all of that but if it makes better financial sense to focus on something else, I will. 

In my checking account I have $1,466.75 (and am fine for covering bills this month.). I have a savings account that my student loan payments come out of, there's $900 in there. And I have another savings account that has $5,493.72. (this was from a low-interest personal loan I took out about a year ago that I didn't end up spending all of on what I took it out for, and I ended up keeping the money because I wanted to have a savings cushion. I have since paid that loan off so this money is free and clear.)

I live alone and my biggest expense is rent: pay $1,225 monthly (I live in an expensive city.). I have federal student loans in the amount of about $250k. I work for the county because after 10 years the federal government will forgive my student loans (theoretically; if this administration doesn't gut that program....). I'm about 5 years in but I have been hearing that the Dept of Ed has been finding ways to screw people at the end of their 10 years, so I'm not sure if I should count on that or not. 

I am sorry for being so long winded; I'm trying to give enough detail without getting into unnecessary territory. Basically, I want to pay off this debt as quickly as possible. It has just been weighing on me so much, and I am having anxiety about it. I feel like I'm on a treadmill, I can make all the minimum payments but I don't feel like I'm making much of a dent. I looked into getting another card with a higher limit to do a full 0% balance transfer but I didn't get approved for much, only $2k I think, I guess because my debts are so high? Should I throw my $5k savings at the Sapphire card just to pay that down? Should I get another consolidation loan? If yes, does anyone have a company to recommend? I'm sorry that I am so clueless about this....",finance

personalfinance,[Debt] Student Loan Help cutting down Interest.,"Greetings All, I need a little help in what to do in this situation. As the title says I need help cutting down interest on my student loans and get them paid out faster.  
Loan 1 - 36k @10%
Loan 2 - 17k @ 10%
Loan 3 - 16k @ 7%

Avg monthly payment - 600.00

So I am aware and familiar with the snowball and avalanche method of paying down debt. The problem is that almost all my monthly payments go towards the interest and very little goes to the primary, I do add more money when I can. I currently can not refinance the loans till my credit is repaired in December (issues with federal loans currently in the process of fixing). I was recently given my Whole Life life insurance policy. With a cash value of 20k. I have a few options with the life insurance policy. 
Option 1 - take a loan of 17k from the policy at 5.5% interest rate (the policy does pay for it self so i wont have to worry about paying into it).
Option 2 - do a secure loan with a better interest rate for the amount of my student loans with the policy pay out encase of death to cover the rest of the loan and not make the bank the beneficiary of the loan. 

just wanted to know your thoughts.",finance
personalfinance,"Currently 28k in dept, about to borrow ~40k for a 3+1 school program from Sallie Mae. Do I have any other options?","Hi everyone, as the title states I currently have 28k in debt, mostly private loans (average 8% interest), and am about to go into my final year of undergrad. I read and researched as much as I could, including from this subreddit, but I feel very stuck.

Here is the problem, tuition is 40k for a 3+1 program (medical technologist with an estimated 50k/year salary outcome). I already have a 5k scholarship and the max federal loans of 6.5k (undergrad, still considered dependent due to age - 23). So I'd need to borrow an additional 40k for tuition and living costs.

I do not qualify for any sort of state grant or loans beyond the direct loans awarded to me. I could get my parents involved for a Parent Plus Loan, but they are fearful of putting such a large amount of money under their name since they are struggling financially.

I tried getting private loans under my name only, but was mostly unsuccessful. My parents cannot cosign, they get rejected. I cannot get my grandparents involved, my grandma cosigned one of my older loans and is still stressed out about it (despite me never missing payment)

The only loan service that will loan me money is Sallie Mae at 10.5% interest. That is absolutely terrifying to me.

So I don't seem to have access to any more federal funding, reasonable private funding, or any family support. This school is ridiculously overpriced but is one of the only programs available in the area. The others would cost 40k+ for 2-3 years VS this accelerated one. I'm in philly, away from home, because there are no med tech programs in my hometown.

Am I fucked? If I waited a year until I turned 24, considered an independent student in the gov eyes, could I secure enough gov loans to cover tuition and living costs? I cannot have a sustainable job with the education I have currently. I had major surgery in 2016 and had my education interrupted. I can't work and go to school, I fear failing out and I can't afford that. 18 credits in fall, 23 credits in spring. No life. But a bachelors and a job in the end.

The current plan is to bite the bullet and get these high interest loans, then refinance later. But is it so easy to refinance? I'm looking into becoming a traveling tech, like a traveling nurse, so my salary would be higher and living expenses covered. Leaving me able to pay off the loans. Is this a solid plan or is it fatally flawed?

Thanks for reading. Any help would be greatly appreciated!!",finance
CryptoCurrency,Interview with development team of FOMO3D–TeamJust,"Recently, Tokenposting and EOT protocol has an interview with development team of FOMO3D-TeamJust who called themselves the most plagiarized team in the history of blockchain.

Q1: How do you come out with the name TeamJust？Any story behind it？

**TeamJust**：Getting “JUSTED” is a common internet meme relating to making a decision that ruins you based upon your own actions. In general, as we’re ironic developers (we create things that break cryptocurrency rules). The joke is that we JUST you when you play our games. When in reality the players who play our content have become very wealthy over the popularity of what we make.

Q2: How was the TeamJust founding story?

**TeamJust**：I accidentally encouraged the other founding developer (mantso) to play a game that crashed to 0. We decided we could do better.

Q3: What are you working on Now? What’s your next plan?

**TeamJust**：Team JUST doesn’t release plans or roadmaps. Since we develop fully functioning products and release them we work the inverse of other cryptocurrency. Where most crypto wants an ICO to raise 100m dollars to make a product. We make a product and it gets 100-500m dollars in volume. It’s trustless because we already created it, you don’t have to pay into us making it.

Q4: You know there are lots of Copycats of TeamJust’s project? Like POWL(proof of Weak legs) POWM, etc.Not to mention countless copy version of FOMO3D, How do you guys see it？

**TeamJust**：A lot of copycats is an understatement. Did you know that EOS copied our P3D model to use for EOS ram? As far as we know we are the most widely copied development team in the history of blockchain. The only thing we can say comes close is the generic token template everyone copy pastes to make custom tokens. The trick is, when we make our games we understand that we as developers cannot be greedy, and we change the math to ensure that we are not greedy. When developers copy our products they do so with greed and a desire to capture some of the success that we have. When you build a decentralized game based on greed, it never succeeds.

Q5: We found out a lot of hidden eggs in your game, such as the Vaporwave,Jekyll Island，Strip girl etc. The mysterious picture released from discord shows some interesting clues related to the secret meeting in Jekyll island. Are you guys going to build up something like a Fed Reserve on top of Ethereum?

**TeamJust**：Could be, it’s not my secret to tell.

Q6: Which Vaporwave artwork is you guys’ favourite? The wallpaper in Fomo OS (256bit)?

**TeamJust**：Is an aesthetic choice, i don’t think we have a favorite.

Q7: Are you guys holding some cryptos？ If so, what are they, how do you see btc,eth,eos etc?

**TeamJust**：There’s a very strong and powerful rule that i advise our community on with investment in cryptocurrency. Could you replace this token with Tether (USD Surrogate) and see the same result? If the answer is yes, then truly it’s an absolutely worthless asset and just a cash grab by a cryptocurrency developer. I can count on one hand the number of currencies that serve a purpose that tether could not, and without fail these currencies always gain market value in relation to the others.

Q8:. How do you guys thinking about the current state of Dapps?

**TeamJust**：They’re a mess, ethereum really suffers from a lack of scam prevention. They’re a revolutionary technology but they don’t have decentralized laws in place to moderate them, making them an extremely dangerous gamble. While some developers are honest and fair they are overshadowed by the absolute sea of theft.

Q9: Some suggestion for people working in the blockchain industry/ Dapps or in general.

**TeamJust**：Don’t open source your game, it’s one of those ideas that is a lofty imaginary vision of what humans could be and should be, but in practice greed ruins it. If you are building something truly impressive and spent a large amount of time building it. Close source as much as you can. I say this as someone who has watched 20-30k eth scammed off others as a result of us open sourcing our code. We can’t prevent it, and it’s a personal burden every time another one is released and hurts people.

Q10: Please provide a team photo if that’s possible (Could wear a mask or cover something if you guys want to stay low key)

**TeamJust**：No. We are fully anonymous.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Rolling over my pension.,"My company has changed its pension plan, and I've been given the decision of how to handle the change. 

Currently I have about 50k in the pension (company mutual fund), in addition to 265k in the rest of my 401k (stock plans).

My options are:

1)Roll over the 50k into the stock plans  

2) Put it into an IRA  

3) Take a lump sump payment / annunity (bad decision).  

4)  Roll it over into its new pension plan.

I'm 44, I expect to work another 20-25 years.  Not married, no kids.    

Normally i would not have a problem with just taking option 1... my companies stock is very good and has gotten me a very nice return over the years ive been investing into it, however its currently at a record high stock price, and I just recently diversified half of it into some other options, so while i could just throw it into something else, I feel like doing that is limiting my choices.  My 401k plan has only specific funds i can invest in, and I kind of would like the option to have more of a free hand with at least some of my 401k to invest into stocks and funds that I choose to instead of just the ones i have available.   

Would putting this money into a new IRA allow me to choose my investments more freely or are they still going to be limiting what i invest in?  Would taking this money from a pension into an ira like this trigger federal / state  taxes on the income?  (As far as I know the money in both pension and stock-401k are deducted pre-tax).   

To do what I'm proposing and have a free hand, would i have to take a lump sum then either day trade/turn it over to an investment company minus taxes paid on that income?  

I know that taking this money out of its safe space right now is a bad idea.  But I wonder if Taking this as a lump sum, paying the taxes on the income on it, then using that money as a down payment on a home might not be a better idea in the long run.  minus taxes I'm looking at about 30k I could use as a Down payment on a nice sized home and given that I'm renting right now, that loss is pretty much countered in about 2 years of putting money into a home morgage instead of throwing it away permanently in rent money.    

My company has typically played it \*very\* safe with its pension fund...at best 3% growth compared to the 10-20% ive been getting from the stock side, so I'm not interested in putting the pension back into its new pension plan.  

Thoughts and opinions welcome.",finance

personalfinance,"My GF got hosed on a car loan, what are her options?","Last September my girlfriend bought a 2008 Nissan Sentra from a shady used car lot in Latonia, KY (Time Auto Sales, avoid this place like the plague). They absolutely took advantage of her lack of information about cars/financing at the time and hosed her on a car loan. I wish I would have known her at the time and I would have strongly advised her against doing business with these shady used car lots, let alone purchasing this car. The car was in decent condition but had 100,000 miles on it, they sold the car her for $10,148 (which is more than TWICE what the car is worth) and financed it at an APR of 19.5%, bringing the total to $12,821 with interest. She is to make 128 payments of $100 until February of 2020, this equates to nearly $400 a month which is nearly a 1/3 of her income. To state the obvious, she cannot afford this. I make decent money and I would struggle to afford this. I don't know anyone whose monthly payment is this outrageous for a car, and if it is they are driving a high-end luxury car. She has been paying on the car for nearly a year now and still owes around $7.5k.

We have looked into refinancing the car with Navy Federal (she is active Army Reserves), but they will not give her a loan because her payoff amount is more than what the car is worth (they valued the car at about $4k in its current condition). The car has about 136k miles on it and is starting to rack up some maintenance costs. The muffler is rusting out (this was something that was not disclosed to her at the time of purchase) and she is going to need her front breaks done soon. I am afraid she is going to be stuck in an awful situation where her car isn't going to last much longer and she is going to be on the hook for the payoff amount of her loan with no car to show for.

Besides refinancing, does she have any other options? I know there are some crafty and savvy redditors our there, I would love for your advice/take on this situation. Thanks in advance!

EDIT: I appreciate all the constructive feedback! I realize my girlfriend made an awful decision and I am not denying her ownership of what she did. After coaching her up, she now understands the significance of her mistake and the financial burden that it is weighing on her.

I am going to have her start with reaching out to her chain of command at her reserve unit and see if she can get pointed in the right direction. In the meantime, all she can do is try to get this thing paid down and keep up with the maintenance on her car, this will require her to work more hours / pick up a 2nd part time job but she has to do what it takes.

As a side note her ETS date is this September. She is considering re-upping her reserve contract for 3 more years and that comes with a 10k signing bonus, so this could potentially help.

Again, I appreciate all the feedback, awesome community!",finance

personalfinance,"Recently 25, Investing, Loan Questions and General Advice","Hello Personal Finance,

Posted a few days ago late at night and only got two responses to the main post so figured I'd try one more time at a better time of day :) (Hope that's not an issue!). Posting this in a secondary account I seldom use since friends are aware of my main account. 

I just turned 25 and feel like I am a in a good path financially, but was looking for a little direction especially when it comes to loans and investments, I had some questions.

For a little background I work in healthcare and currently make ~$100,000/yr. I have been working since I graduated in 2016. I have a [401k from my previous job and just started it for my current job.](https://i.imgur.com/ak8Jmxb.jpg) Previous job is on the bottom current job is on the top. The reason the current jobs amount is low is because of a requirement to wait 6 months before I was eligible to enroll at this new job. I have a Roth IRA with Vanguard. that I just signed up for, but have not yet made any investments in yet. Current company does not provide company match for 401k.

Next up I have student loans. Total amount [$24,611.36.](https://i.imgur.com/85rTvNN.jpg) This is down from an amount of around $40,000.00 two years ago when I graduated, but I lived at home while I worked and paid a portion of it down with some assistance from my parents (they paid the interest initially so I could start paying the principal on my own). That is the total amount of the loans, but [here](https://i.imgur.com/HpnF429.jpg) and [here](https://i.imgur.com/aHYoIJf.jpg) are the broken down amounts with the interest rates, it is through Great Lakes.

I have an adequate emergency fund. My total savings in my savings account from the past two years totals up to **$52,405.08**. I doubled my yearly salary this year when I began traveling and doing contract work. The money I make is just sitting in my savings account doing nothing which is why I’m interested in starting to invest some of it. I bought a book on investing and have been reading up on that.

Other tid bits: I don’t have a car note currently and the only bill I’m responsible for is rent. Single adult, no pets. My parents pay cell phone and car insurance and I remain on their health plan. No credit card debt. I’m very grateful of their generosity in helping me get started in my adult life. Parents will be giving me $6,000 as the home I grew up in recently was sold.

So after all the background, my questions are:

1) How should I handle my student loans? When my parents pay me the money from the house sale should I just pay them off? Or should I keep paying incremental amounts, they are already paid ahead for about a year currently.

2) With the 401k from my old company through prudential. Should I leave that money alone and do nothing with it? Should I try to roll it over into an IRA?

3) Any suggestions for the set up of the IRA and which funds and allocations you might recommend for someone my age?

4) Any other additional advice to someone at my point in life that you have to offer?

Thanks if you read my wall of text!",finance

personalfinance,"Another home equity line of credit question; using a HELOC to fully pay off everything, including the mortgage.","Hello All!

Searching the /r/personalfinance archives, I've seen a lot of questions regarding using home equity lines of credit to pay a mortgage, but I haven't seen one that closely matches my scenario.

Our background;  my wife and I both work full time, and own a co-op apartment in a large urban environment in the USA with a traditionally healthy and desirable real estate market.  Due to some good fortune, good luck, and management of previous investments, we were able to purchase our apartment putting about 75% down.  Leaving us with a mortgage for only about 25% of the purchase price.  This was a few years ago, so we have a home equity percentage of over 75% now.  Additionally we are both near maxing out our 401k, each have 5 figures of student loans, some medium sized credit card debt.

Retired relatives (who are not financial professionals, but have done quite well with their finances and investments) have made a suggestion.  They've suggested we take a large HELOC (which they say will not be a problem given the apartment's equity ratio), enough to fully pay off the mortgage, our student loans, and our credit card debt.

According to the relatives, this gives us the advantage of having a single debt.  We'd ask for an interest only payment plan, and then send as much as we reasonably can additionally to pay down the principal.  And now that we'd have no other debt, we should be able to send a good amount.  And enough unused of the line of credit to help us in some sort of future need (though I've learned here on this subreddit that a HELOC should not be considered an emergency fund).

One downside that struck me is that the HELOC interest rate is higher than our current mortgage.  Although lower than the student loans and credit cards.  And I can't help but have an uneasy feeling that there are more downsides that we haven't considered.

Does anyone have any thoughts about this?

Thank you for your help!   

**Edit** to add some numbers:

* Current mortgage has about 192k left at 3.5%.
* Purchase price of the apartment was 825k. We don't have an official appraisal, but judging by other transactions in our building, we'd expect that a current sale price would be between 5-10% higher.
* Our student loan debts total about 100k.
* Our credit card debts combine to about 15k.
* Combined income of about 230k.

I wish to thank everyone for their help!  You've given us some great ideas and direction.",finance
personalfinance,Question about Retroactive Deductions on Paystub,"I’ve been working at a small office (five employees) and we all calculate and create our own pay stubs with how much we need to withhold and give those to the boss who direct deposits the Net Pay and sends the pay stubs we give her to her accountant. I’ve been using an online calculator to generate pay stubs and haven’t been particularly worried about being off by a few dollars because I was under the impression that it would all be corrected at the end of the year when I file my taxes. 

Now to the problem - my boss has decided to go back through every pay stub I’ve given her this year and has calculated that I subtracted wrong when I was subtracting the various withholding that I calculated (federal, ss, state, etc.) and my net pay was too high a few times. So yes, that happened - blame rushing to fill out the information or inattention. Adding up all of the times I was off by a 10/20 dollars the total difference is over $100. Now she is wants to subtract the number from my last paycheck (I’m leaving to go to grad school). I asked her several times why it’s necessary since I’ve been withholding too much to begin with so I’ll just get $100ish less in my refund and she said she wants her numbers to match what they should be theoretically. This makes no sense to me and since I’m only working a half week before I leave this deduction will bring me under minimum hourly wage if I divide what she’ll actually pay me by how many hours I’ve worked. 

This whole thing seems so convoluted to me but I honestly don’t know if she’s right or what the rationale is because I don’t know enough about these things. Can someone explain to me if my boss is doing the right thing in deducting from my final pay check? If not, how can I phrase my request for her to not do this? (I actually have a great relationship with her and would prefer to leave on a good note, and I honestly don’t mind if she’s in the right I just want a good explanation of the rationale) 

EDIT: I think I got my answer! Thanks guys - that was fast!",finance

personalfinance,How much stock to sell?,"Update: Now looking for a good CPA. Tips to find one welcomed.

# Background

We have some stock from a company I used to work for that is doing quite well. **We have been gradually selling it off to diversify our portfolio, while also trying not to trigger a huge tax bill.**

The ""problem"" is that the stock keeps increasing in value, and selling it gradually has been taking a while. I'd love your input on how much we should sell this year. (Incidental other advice welcome too though not my main focus.)

I've had on my todo list to ask some kind of professional about this for awhile but haven't been able to bring myself to do it yet (anxiety I guess).

# Some details that might be useful

* If I sold all my remaining stock in the company today, **gain would be approximately 500k (all long term)**
* We are early 30s MFJ in California
* Estimated **income this year from other sources max 200k** (mostly spouse w2 income). Current regular spending is a bit less than this. Using excess to max retirement and then the rest just in savings.
* Future income level somewhat uncertain. Spouse might take some time off, and I might earn more (not able to work much currently due to illness).
* Have 200k in tax-advantaged retirement accounts
* Have 150k in other accounts
* We live in a high cost of living area, but bought our home long ago (when we could barely afford it, but after a few rough years in the middle there, luckily it has worked out so far)
* Short term financial goals:
   * exercise some ISO options my spouse has - so we need cash for strike price and likely AMT.
   * considering buying our first car
   * home maintenance / improvement

# Some research on federal taxes I've done to try to find an income ""sweet spot""

* \~190k MAGI - Roth IRA phaseout. There are workarounds, and we'll almost definitely pass this level anyway.
* \~250k MAGI - some extra taxes kick in, such as 3.8% to Medicare.
* \~300k MAGI - former beginning of phase out of itemized deductions, but no longer applies through 2025 because of tax reform
* \~479k MAGI - long term capital gains rate increases by 5%

# Current tentative plan

**Sell enough stock to bring total income for year to around 479k (so selling stock with gains of about 279k), but no more.** (Though if this all makes sense, I should probably do some research into California-specific ""sweet spot"" too.) Does that seem like a good plan to you?",finance
personalfinance,"Girlfriend's student Loans at 100k, already refinanced &amp; payments at $800/mo, does she have any additional options","So my girlfriend and I graduated in 2015 from a state university. I made out at about 58k in debt myself, which is above the national average but luckily I make enough to deal w/ the $500/mo payments. 

My girlfriend on the other hand graduated with over $100k in student loan debt. Initially when her loan went into repayment her monthly payments were $1,400/mo. Her dad told her that she should go through a state bank and consolidate to bring the payments down. They are still at $800/mo. Currently she is on a probationary period at her job where she is making $15/hr and once she is hired permanently she will be making $18/hr and will be back-payed for her probation. 

That being said, even with her new rate her loan payments eat up almost exactly 1/3 of her adjusted income. She looked into a federal loan forgiveness program but since she already consolidated with a state bank, she is ineligible. 

Does she have any options that could bring her payments down or has she sealed her fate entirely with the consolidation?

Thanks in advance.",finance
personalfinance,$620/mo car payment; get rid of it or keep it?,"Purchased a used car for \~$45,000 May of 2016 with 9,000 miles.  I put $5,500 down and the original note was at \~$39,500.  72 months. 3.94% interest rate (had a cosigner).  I currently owe \~$22,700.  My credit is 800 at the moment.

My car payment is $620/mo.  I can technically ""afford"" this, but I haven't been able to save much of anything over the past two years.. and am somewhat regretting the purchase (even though I love the car, I may have been a little depressed when I purchased it).

On top of that monthly payment, I've been dropping $1,300/yr in taxes, have had to buy new tires already, plus all of the maintenance.  I'm still alive and there isn't any real stress but my savings is constantly fluctuating to like $1,000 and $0.

All-in-all, I think I could be saving $9,000+/yr by ditching this thing.. I barely drive it (work from home) and I've just hit 20,000 miles.

Should I sell it, take the hit of all the money I've put into it, and just try doing without a car or buying a much cheaper used car?  Should I keep it and just treat it as an investment of having a car that will potentially be with me for 10+ more years?  Should I try refinancing it for lower monthly payments so that I can save more?

My main goal at the moment is to begin saving for purchasing a condo but this car seems to be inhibiting me and I don't want to be age 35 and still not have a property of my own (I'm 29 right now so have just over 5 years to make my goal).

**Edit - I truly appreciate all the help so far; unfortunately, this is near the same as fighting with myself in my brain. =)  I am going to inquire a bit further into all my options: go to my regular bank to see what refinancing can do (my personal bank isn't the bank that owns the loan for this car--it was just a bank that gave me the lowest interest rate), see what a dealer might trade me in at, research what needs to be done for a personal sale, and then take all that info and weigh the pros/cons for keeping vs. selling at this point.**

**For those inquiring, I make $75,000/yr and definitely know I have other places where I can cut my spending for savings (as I splurge a lot on audio equipment that is unnecessary)--but that is being worked on separately.  Trying to turn it all around here if possible!**

**The price of the car does include 4-5 maintenance packages (oil, wheel punctures and rim scuffs, scratches/dents/etc., and the every 10,000 mile maintenance/checkup) as well as having the front half of the car wrapped in protective material to prevent damage to the finish.**",finance
financialindependence,Plan for Parental Care during Road to FI,"I know that parental care has always been a hot button issue in this sub. For the purposes of this thread, there really is no debate for me - my wife and I have agreed to take care of my Mother in Law when she is older. The question is how to do it in a way that does not greatly impede our path to FI, which we hope to achieve in 10-15 years (currently 30).

So I came up with a plan. My MiL will be immigrating to the US sometime in the coming year. She will be a green card holder for 5 years then become a citizen via naturalization. She has no assets and no income. My plan is to make sure that she has at least access to minimum social security benefits, and more importantly, Medicare coverage, after 10 years.

The plan is to hire my MiL as a 1099 contractor to help out with house cleaning and babysitting. She will be living with us rent free. I plan on paying her the federal minimum to qualify for SS, which I believe is around 5k to 6k a year. Doing so as a 1099 contractor will ensure I do not get tangled with employee taxes. My MiL will file her own taxes with quarterly withholdings, which will not be much given the low income. This way, after 10 years of work, she will be approximately 65, and will be able to qualify for a very small SS benefit, but more importantly, access to Medicare A coverage. 

The cost of this arrangement for me and my wife is basically the payment of $5k to $6k annually to my MiL for 10 years.  I think this is the best way for us to brace ourselves for the likely high amount of medical expenses that will come our way when she gets older.  Plus, the added benefit is that my MiL will have some spending money, plus we are getting a very useful service in return (my wife and I are really lazy people and our house is a mess).  Is there a down side to this?  Given that not caring for my MiL is not an option, paying 50-60k over 10 years to ensure that she has at least some sort of safety net is a pretty good tradeoff, right? According to my calculations, it should delay our FIRE path by only one year, which is not bad at all considering the peace of mind we will have with my MiL's care.",finance
personalfinance,Mortgage rate holds and credit rating in Canada,"I'm in the process of moving between cities in Canada. I own a home that I am trying to sell where I used to live and want to buy in the new city. Interest rates are slowly but surely rising so I got a rate hold a few months ago which is set to expire soon. A credit check was required to get the first rate hold and my mortgage broker confirmed that to renew the hold I have now another credit check would be required. The broker believes this will impact my credit score but I want the Reddit PF community's input as well. I know there are two types of inquiries and one type moves your score, the other doesn't. I'm not sure which applies here. The bank who I have a rate hold through is one of the big 5. 

My other question is, is it worth getting a rate hold assuming it moves my credit rating down slightly? What information, if any, should I provide to get a good answer to this from the PF community? My credit score, budget, etc? Or is there a general rule of thumb that applies in all circumstances. Are rate holds worth it?",finance
personalfinance,UK - How long does it take for a credit card company to see me as a 'new customer' again?,"I ended up getting myself into quite a lot of credit card debt (£16,000) and I have sought out a loan from Natwest at 14.7% interest for 5 years. Having done the math, it still works out cheaper to do this rather than pay the extortionate credit card interest rates over a longer period of time.  


I have noticed (and used!) credit cards such as BarclayCard that have money transfer offers for 60 months interest free. I was hoping to use this to pay off a chunk of the loan, reducing the amount of interest I pay, and make payments towards both at the same time. However, this offer is for new customers only and as I already have a Barclaycard, I cannot go for it.  


I was wondering, as I am planning on paying off my current Barclaycard fully, If I was to cancel the card, how long would I have to wait to be regarded as a new customer again, and take advantage of the offer? I have noticed a number of banks with similar offers on Money transfers (such as Tesco &amp; Halifax) but again, as I have credit cards with these companies I cannot utilise their new customer offers.",finance
personalfinance,Getting serious about paying off debt,"I have been holding a decent amount of credit card debt for about the past two years in a good amount of denial. I would like to finally put a plan together and get rid of this debt to better my overall financial situation. I just reached my pinnacle in debt and have about $13k in credit card debt spread around 8 cards. 

* Amex $400 - limit $1000 APR 24%

* Amex $2700 - limit $4000 APR 0% for ~12 more months

* BOFA $2700 - limit $5000 APR 0% for ~12 more months

* Chase $3000 - limit $6000 APR 20%

* Chase $3000 - limit $6500 APR 23%

* Chase $0 - limit $5000 APR 25%

* Wells Fargo $500 - limit $3100 APR 18%

* Wells Fargo $1000 - limit $3800 APR 27% (the 1k balance on this is from a balance transfer @0% for the next 12 months)

My score was sitting at 720 for a long time and recently tanked down to 670 because i put on another 2k in debt when I moved since I had to put down a large deposit and was in denial about all of this and my credit was doing alright. I got lucky getting this place because my score was still at 720 then. This has been what has finally put me over. I am thinking my best course of action would be consolidate the debt from the accounts that are not on the 0% APR terms but would love some feedback and advice. That would come out to a 8k loan. I have got a quote for a personal loan for 8k @ 15%. The interest rate seems high to me for a personal loan but since my credit score is so low then I guess I'm not too surprised. I don't think consolidating here is really gonna help me now that I put it out like this. Any one who has more experience here or just general advice would be appreciated.

I know my best course of action to just take all my credit cards, put them off to the side, and use cash/debit for any purchases that I need to make. I just took them out of my wallet now. Right now I am 24 and currently making $75,000 a year and take home 4k a month after taxes, insurance, and 401k contributions. I am paying 1600 in rent and 350 a month in student loan payments. I have another 250 in monthly bills/utilities that I am on the hook for right now in addition to paying about 300 a month to commute to work. I am currently looking for a position closer to home where I should be able to get a 10k+ raise in salary (hoping for more plus a signing bonus to help pay this off but I need to stay realistic) and eliminate the cost of commute. This leaves me with about 1500 to work with to pay for everything else. I think I can afford to pay about $700 a month in payments but maybe that's not enough. That would leave me with paying it off in probably 2 years. I suppose that's not too bad and will go down when I find a new position.

Some of this debt came from the fact that I lost a lot of weight and bought a new wardrobe, expensive computer parts that I couldn't afford, and then from moving. I started building this debt in college when I was living outside my means and had about $3k in debt at the end on credit cards. I am continuing those habits and need to reformulate behaviors to stay within my means. I continue to spend about $300 a month on clothes as i rebuild my wardrobe and am struggling to stop that. Like I said above, I spent about 1k in things for my new apartment. I eat out too much and struggle to consistently make my lunches and bring them to work. I go through phases where I do it diligently and then give up a week and spend $150 one week in just lunches. I know my main issue is that I am just in denial about the whole thing and I go through phases of paying off 5k in debt because I get scared and then just putting it right back on in a few months when I feel like I'm starting to feel okay about it all. I know this is turning into an admission of guilt and recitation of my issues but I need to get it out so I can come to terms with it and then begin to fix it with real change.

I also have 2k in an investing account that I have not been making good gains in. Should I leave this here or take it out now and help pay down this debt? I would take it out at a loss so there would be no tax implications. 

I know this is mostly a spending issue and any help from people who have struggled with this and recovered, I couldn't appreciate it more.",finance
personalfinance,Broad strokes for financial future?,"Hello all! I'm posting here to try and get some more refined advice on my financial options moving forward. Here's the run-down:

* 25 yo Male
* Single/No Kids (planning on settling down after mil separation)
* USAF Officer (O2)
* Stationed in San Antonio
* Degree in Computer Engineering
* Credit Score: ~720
* Career plan: Separate in late 2020; enter private sector as software/hardware comp eng.

Up until now I've been cavalier with finances, and made some good (starting matching retirement fund) and some very bad decisions (USAA career starter loan), but fortunately I've been able to get back on track through frugality and applying some common sense. My income is public record, but here you go:

Net Monthly Income (Allowances - Deductions inc. TSP contrib.):

 * **Total: ~$5,120**

Monthly Expenses (non-debt):

* Rent + Utilities - $ 900
* Gas - $ 120
* Groceries / Food - $ 300
* Miscellaneous - $200
* **Total: (-$1,520)**

Debts (owed/paying monthly):

* USAA Career Starter Loan (2.99%) - $16,296.99/$450
* FedLoan Student Loans (3.65% - 5.75%) - $27,797.08/$500
* FFSCU Auto Loan (3.65%) - $12,697.78/$350
* Capital One Quicksilver CC (4%) - $2,318.47/$1000 (paying off ASAP to maximize credit score)
* **Total: (-$60,990.42)/(-$2,300)**

Savings:

* TSP (5% contributing + 5% matching): $1,399.09 currently
* Emergency Fund: $Gooseegg
* **Total: $1,399.09**

Right now my two biggest priorities are a) maximizing my credit score by completely paying off my CC (want to wipe out debt anyway, why not get the added benefit up front), and b) building a 6-month emergency fund (thinking about CDs, I-bonds, etc.)

Once these two goals are achieved (CC 2 months, E-fund 4; total 6 months), I plan on pivoting to maximizing my pay-off rates of my loans to hit a 36-month payoff window:

* USAA Career Starter Loan (2.99%) - $450
* FedLoan Student Loans (3.65% - 5.75%) - $650
* FFSCU Auto Loan (3.65%) - $360
* **Total: (-$1,460)/month**

while using the remaining income to start building a more robust investment portfolio.

I'll be getting out of the military about half-way through this period, and entering the private sector making significantly more money, so the pay-offs and contributions will almost certainly increase.

ALL THAT BEING SAID: Is my roadmap for the next couple years solid? Am I leaving money anywhere, or focusing on the wrong elements (debts or savings), or doing anything else hair-brained? 

Thank you!",finance
personalfinance,"How can I request a ""Balance Liquidation"" program from a creditor?","I recently changed jobs, which turned out to be a mistake, financially. The income has dried up to a third of what I was making previously. I'm currently searching for a new job that will pay what I need to be making to live comfortably, but I am having trouble in the meantime making my payments on credit cards.

I called the creditors and explained the situation, and asked if they had any programs available for me. The first one, Chase, gave me two options - one would let me make small payments every month for five years, but close the account. They called this a ""Balance Liquidation Program"".  This was a godsend for me, as I wouldn't have to accrue more late fees or delinquency hits on my credit report. It would just appear as a closed account.  The other option was to make reduced payments for 90-180 days at a lower interest rate, and then the payments would go back up (but I would still be reported as delinquent until the end of the 90-180 day period.  I chose the former due to my current situation.  It was nice to have a large burden off my chest.

I have two additional creditors, Barclays and Capital One. I also called them and explained the situation the same way, but was presented with a different option, which isn't quite as good for me.  They wanted me to make a small payment so that I would remain delinquent (and getting charged late fees), but not become \_more\_ delinquent.  That may be a great idea for a short term financial setback, but with the late fees stacking on top of the minimum amount due, it's not enough to ever make any headway towards paying off the debt. Both places assured me that there were no other repayment options available to me. They both seemed confused as to what the term ""balance liquidation"" meant, though I'm sure they are  supposed to push for whichever option makes more money for them, yeah?

I'm curious if there is a certain way to request for the repayment method Chase offered me when talking to these other creditors? I want to pay them what I owe, but I'm just not in a position to pay enough to make progress yet.",finance
personalfinance,Company used my SSN as their Tax Id number. Are there any potential problems that could occur?,"So I posted a few days ago about a situation with my bank. It's been resolved, at least as far as my bank account issues, but now I'm starting to wonder if there are potential ramifications I haven't thought about.

To summarize, last weekend I couldn't use my ATM card or access my bank account online, and when I called the automated line for my bank, three accounts were associated with my SSN, and I only had one. Went to the bank on Monday and they figured out a company that has been a client of the bank's since the 70s (I was born in the 80s), was using my SSN as their TIN and they had recently enrolled in online banking with the bank, which had caused the issues. The bank was able to fix the issues I was having and will continue to resolve the issue with the numbers being the same (I took my SS card in today so they could make a copy to help with their resolution of the issue) and the teller told me the company could get shut down because of this. I'm guessing because using my number as theirs would have to have been done intentionally rather than a simple error, like something was just transposed.

All this is just to ask, can anyone think of any potential ramifications from this company using my Social? I've never had any issues with my taxes (and I even was a federal employee a few years ago) and nothing ever came up to make me think something like this could have been going on.

Edit: I do have a family member that wonders if the bank just wrote down the wrong TIN when the company opened the account, maybe transposed a number, but wouldn't this have come up somehow in 40+ years?

Edit 2: Another family member thinks I should call the IRS about a case of possible identify theft.  If they don't know my name or any other information about me, could they commit identify theft?",finance

My dad died some years ago, my mom moved back to our state of Indiana to be closer to her kids.  She gets annuity, my dads SS money, and she has a job, which was originally just for insurance and part time, but now is full time.  She's a few years from full retirement.  Basically, when you put it all together, she's now got about 3k a month coming in.  
So I get a call today, thinking she's just calling to wish me happy birthday, but evidently she's overdrawn in her bank account, and needs money so she doesn't get overdraft charges.  So I give her $300 cash, cause mom never asked me for anything $ before now.  I ask about it, and evidently my mom has 40k in credit card debt stretched over 11 cards with more than a few interest rates over 20%.
Flashback to me being 21, I hafta return home with a bunch of credit card debt, Dad cosigns a loan, I pay it down.  Now I'm mostly debt free (one small loan and a mortgage) no credit cards and such myself.  So Mom being in a situation that dad bailed me out of, makes me feel pretty obligated to set up, and I want to.
So we talk, she mentions getting a loan against her life insurance policy?  Which I guess is like 69k?  Because she can't get a loan on her own.  My credit score (according to USAA) is 815.

So my first response was to pay off a few of her high interest credit cards, since that'll free up money to pay off other ones.  I got 14k in my checking account and that number just keeps climbing over the last 3 years or so, so I figure I can spare 4-5k, and free up some funds for my mom without it really hurting me much, as I basically want for nothing now.

So the third part is, my mom offered before I knew any of this, to take me out for steak for my birthday next Tuesday, but now knowing that she's broke, I feel compelled to insist we not go.  She doesn't need to be spending any unnecessary money.  But at the same time, I don't know that I want to hurt her feelings or anything.  But it seems pretty obvious that my mom can't handle money.

A few thoughts I had while mowing was going to my bank tomorrow, find out if 40k is something I could get a loan for her for, and doing that.  I don't have any reason to think my mom would let me down, but I do recall a time growing up when my folks had significant credit card debt and paid it off.  I'd be a little worried she'd get in the same funk again, having not learned her lesson from some 20 years ago.  But I don't want to be too harsh.

I also intend to either pay directly one or two of her higher balance cards, but wonder if I should just give her a check and let her do it, or personally try to do it myself.   Anyhow, I welcome advice.",finance
personalfinance,(24 year old) Checking in - How am I doing? Next Steps?,"I'm looking for some constructive criticism on my current finances and have some questions on what my next step (if any) should be.

**My Questions:**

1. I have been putting a heavy chunk of my earnings towards my student loans in order to get out of the hole I dug myself. My reasoning being that the guaranteed return on the interest rates of the loans is likely better than I will get from dumping that same money into my 401(k)/HSA or an IRA

2. Should I look into getting a Roth IRA? Or does a 401(k) and an HSA suffice here?

3. Can you recommend anything else that I am not already considering going forward? I think that I am in a good spot as-is, but I am always open to input.

**Some Background:**

I am 24 years old, working and living in Seattle, WA and making ~57000/yr ($27.45 hourly, 1.5x overtime). I've been at my company for a little over a year now, and just recently received a 6% raise as well as access to a company 401(k) account. I have elected (for now) to put 7% into the account monthly, which gets me the company's 5% match. This may seem low, but I'll detail the rest of my finances below.

Additionally, my company puts $2500/year into an HSA to pay for qualifying medical expenses. I pay an additional $90/mo. to max my contribution for the year at $3450.

I currently have $3000 in my emergency fund, as I recently had to make a payment of $1800 for repair of damages to another vehicle. It's a long story. My goal is to get this to around $10,000.

My HSA balance is at $3700, and I am getting charged $2.50 fees every month due to the balance being below the $5000 minimum. I'd like to fix this ASAP.

**Breakdown:**

$27.45/hr * 40 hrs * 4.3 months  ~= $4750/mo.

After 401(k) this becomes ~$4420.

Assuming 20% income tax brings us to $3534/mo. gross

**Expenses:**

Rent: $740 ($2050 split 3 ways)

Student Loan 1 (~7.5% interest): $370/mo. - Upped to $800/mo. to pay off quicker

Student Loan 2 (~4.6 interest): $311/mo. - Upped to $500/mo. to pay off quicker

Car Payment: $250/mo.

HSA contr.: $90/mo.

Gym: $82/mo. (2 memberships)

Internet: $55/mo. (split 3 ways with roommates)

Electricity: Varies - Tends to average ~$50/mo.

Phone: $40/mo.

Netflix: $15/mo.

Produce Delivery: $32/mo. (2 boxes/mo.)

Food: ~$300/mo.

Restaurants: ~$100/mo.

This leaves ~$600/mo. of which I have allotted $500/mo. to my emergency fund, and the remainder is left for ""fun"" things - to include bars/alcohol/movie tickets.",finance
personalfinance,"Denied for loan at dealership; Salesperson glossed over the denial and said don't worry, everyone gets denied for some reason","Hi all, not sure if this is the right place to post this, but this thing had a slimy feel to it and made me go, 'huuuuh...?' inside.

So. Buying a new car last year. I'm in for the 0% promotional financing. I have good credit. (750ish?)  They do the credit report and get the form letter that was generated said (as the post title mentions) 'Sorry, your application for credit has been denied', blah blah. I'm like... ""umm... why?"" The salesperson says, 'oh, don't worry, that's how it comes back for everyone for some reason.'

I'm thinking, huh. Something's broke. But then I had more time to think about it, and I'm wondering if that makes it easy to deny a 0% loan to people they don't want to give a 0% loan to? I'm a white dude. So I guess I'm fortunate not to experience that kind of discrimination. But I wonder...are they using this 'broken' letter to discriminate? Has anyone else been 'denied on paper' at the dealership but then the dealership glossed over and said not to worry, you can still get the low interest special?

Thought about posting for a while then forgot. But the recent 19.5% car loan story reminded me of this.

/edit and more info: Got the interest rate I came in for, no issue. They didn't give me a run around trying to tell me I didn't qualify. It's just the initial paperwork that came back said I didn't. I felt like that paper just gave them an 'out' if they didn't want to give me the promotion; a tool to negotiate the interest rate.",finance

solar,Small panels for small roof space (i.e. roof with roof deck)?,"I live in southern California and my house has a roof-deck which takes about 70% of the roof space away form regular solar panel installation. I do **not** want to place the panels on or over the deck, so panels should go on the little roof space that I do have. Here is a rough draft: [https://imgur.com/a/9CfHZ96](https://imgur.com/a/9CfHZ96)

I had a couple of Solar Companies come over to give me an estimate and both companies used their laptop to determine if an installation would allow me to produce enough energy to take advantage of the government incentives. In both cases they said that they can't work with my roof. However, the sales engineers used bad satellite images to come up with their estimates, which didn't capture the entire state of my roof. There are some roof spaces where I believe is enough room to stack a few panels, however, those were hidden in the satellite images they used, so the software refused to work. 

My question is: Is there a company (in California) that specializes in smaller roofs or in smaller panels to cover spaces smaller than the average full roofed home? 

At this point I'm not sure if I should continue looking for a solar solution or maybe wait a few years until efficiency has improved as well as cost has come down. Or until more panel solutions are available. My understanding is that eventually, solar companies will get creative in the variety of panels they offer once most regular roofs are already covered.

btc,Proposal for Making Decentralized Development Work (or at least less prone to toxicity),"The Bitcoin Cash community is now facing stress tests, not of the technological but human kind. Developers are NOT in harmony. Is this what our community wants? I don't think so. Our community said we wanted decentralized development, having been traumatized by Core. However, just throwing varied devs into an unstructured environment saying okay... Go! is not conducive to making a complicated, unique-to-the-world, multi-billion dollar, multi-discipline open source project work; not when there are all sorts of potential communication issues (perhaps semantic/language, maybe personality), financial interests (like the 5 million euro [token solution incentive](https://coingeek.com/bitcoin-cash-bch-tokenization-contest-5-million-prize/), of which implementation devs are participating), and varied technical challenges and opinions. What we get is what we have: tensions building up, cliques forming, and emotions and biases influencing what should be purely technical actions. We start having attempts at gaining sway for individual approaches, as everyone is sure their way is best, for whatever reason(s).

We end up avoiding one problem (Core-like obstinance) and creating another, which likely still leads to centralized development as people get fed up and either quit (devs are human, underpaid and typically stressed already), or fork off. Developers don't grow on trees. Lose enough and we're left with centralized development anyway, definitely at a loss as the most productive/competent people can usually make their fortunes/successes easily elsewhere. So we should take care of devs, and not just throw them into a gladiator pit, saying fend competitively for yourself. Devs are not expected to be great negotiators. They shouldn't have to solve this on their own.

I propose a 3 part solution. I caution: adopt at least Part 1, or propose something better; but leaving this unaddressed, waiting until the next time something explodes is not a good option.

**Part 1 - Lowest Common Denominator (LCD) Development**

The Bitcoin white paper doesn't mention tokens, yet here we all are. Obviously, we all feel Bitcoin works well enough as described in the white paper to succeed. The idea behind LCD decentralized development is developers start with the broadest areas of agreement *first* to work on. What's the one thing everyone in this community agrees on? Easy: big blocks. We need not an 8MB limit, not a 32MB limit, but to remove the limit entirely to forevermore solve at least that issue, the reason for our fork. So developers work first prioritizing fixing block size as there should be the least disagreement there. Immediately devs start working together = improvement! Working together productively can build mutual bonds of goodwill and respect, which can help with Part 2. So Part 1 is identifying areas of existing agreement and prioritizing working there first.

**Part 2 - A Structure for Non-consenus Proposals**

The white paper, as good as it is, didn't foresee everything. There are ways Bitcoin can work better. However, this is the most challenging area for ""leaderless"" development. How do we settle on one way forward? Easy. We don't, not unless everyone agrees. If our community is to stick to this dev model we must accept that stalled progress on issues is part of the risk that comes with the turf. Developers, if they have time and energy first make a convincing improvement proposal, such as a way to implement tokens. This should be recorded and logged with technical objections. 

Time helps immensely with solving technical issues. If there are objections, clearly delineated, they can be addressed over time. Take the block size as an example. Time and time again big-blockers gave compelling arguments why raising the block size various ways was safely tolerable. When Core still objected more arguments were presented as well as scaling down the risk boundaries (eg going from unlimited to XT, all the way down to just 2X). It became clear Core wasn't objecting for technical but other reasons, because the technical arguments were clearly on the big-blockers' side, as Bitcoin Cash now 1 year old clearly proves. In the event an improvement proposal is repeatedly objected to, but for reasons obviously not technical the issue can be brought before the wider community for the last possibility: evaluating the need to fork off. Personally I don't think there is any reason the BCH community should ever split beyond getting our key objective of bigger blocks. I'm just illustrating this structure works and how it would have worked against Core's blockage.

**Part 3 - Neutral Communication Area**

Development teams have their own internal methods of communication. However, for implementations to remain in consensus a broader area where devs from different implementations can converse should exist. This channel should *not* be under the power of anyone directly involved with an implementation because of the possibility of intended or unintended heavy handed moderation due to (unavoidable) bias. My proposal is a common area development forum be set up. I don't think it should be chat style. I think a traditional forum with static, dated conversations is best for devs on different time schedules. In the absence of something new being set up we can simply use threads on /r/btc. This has the benefit of being uncensored and neutral, and also typically exposing technical discourse to those who may possess technical insights but not work primarily on an implementation.

personalfinance,Need advice regarding HSA/FSA/401k/Roth 401k and student loans,"Using a throwaway account for anonymity. 

I just started my first job out of college and have to make my decision regarding benefits by the end of the week. I'll post the details of my current financial situation below along with my options. 

Income: $70,000/yr paid bi weekly \~$2,400 week (post taxes).  

Debt: $70,000 all in student loans (in grace period until December)

* $30,000 in federal subsidized loans at 
   * \~3.4% fixed interest rate 
   * Minimum monthly payment: $305
* $40,000 in a parent plus loan (my responsibility) 
   * 5.59% variable interest rate 
   * Minimum monthly payment: $430
      * Hoping to refinance this at some point but don't know if I could get a better rate (740 credit score).

After covering my basic expenses (minimum payment on debt included), I""m left with about $1400 a month. I already have a small emergency fund of $2000 built up and was wondering what advice or suggestions you all had on what would be the best way to maximize my leftover income. 

Options for excess income:

* Employer Retirement Plans: 
   * My employer provides a retirement plan with a 8.5% match. I obviously am going to take advantage of this and contribute 8.5% at a minimum, but wasn't sure if I should go with a traditional 401k, a post tax 401k, or a roth 401k? I anticipate retiring in a higher tax bracket than I am now, but am not sure what is the best for the current time being. 
* Employer HSA and FSA Account
   * My employer also offers an HSA account should I opt in to the medical insurance plan, with a $250 contribution annually from my employer. I don't foresee my self having any significant medical bills in the immediate future.
   * My employer also offers an FSA account but with no employer contribution. 

My questions:

1. Which 401k plan makes the most sense for someone in my position if I plan on contributing \~8.5% of my salary to it?
2. With my excess income should I max out my HSA account? ($380/month contribution) Should I contribute at all to the offered FSA account?
3. Any money leftover I plan on utilizing to pay off my parent plus loan as quickly as possible while making minimum payments on my federal loan since it has a lower interest rate. Does this make solid financial logic?

Any advice or suggestions are greatly appreciated. This is my first post in this subreddit so I apologize if the formatting is trash.",finance
personalfinance,"Fresh out of school, looking for advice on where to put my money","So basically, I'm 22 years old, and I've been out of school for a couple months now and landed a decent job that pays me $3600/month, after taxes. This job is a W2 contract position, so some of my benefits here are limited. The thing I feel that I miss most is a 401k match (more on this later). My monthly spending is as follows:

* $160 car payment
* $150 car insurance
* $250 gas (I commute \~45 mins to work every day, currently living with my mother - more later)
* Mom is currently paying for my health insurance - may end up taking this over, so add $200
* $200 food

I managed to get out of school with no debt, other than my car, which has roughly $5,000 left on the loan with a 4.5% interest rate. I have also saved about \~$42k in other assets, which I will breakdown as follows:

* 15k in Vanguard ETFs -&gt; 8k VBK, 5k MGK, 2k VXF
* 2k in Robinhood - just using this to get a feel of single stock and see if I can make anything
* The rest (\~25k) in checking

I have been thinking about putting more into my Vanguard fund, but I'm not entirely certain that it's the right move. I want to keep enough in my emergency fund (checking, may move to HYS) to cover myself in case something happens. I'm also afraid of potential risks that come with investing such amounts into ETFs in case of a market crash or something, since I'm pretty new to the whole investing thing. My plan of attack was to max my Roth this year, for sure, but I'm relatively unsure of what to do with the remaining \~20k or so (or even if I should keep my Vanguard/RH investments). I could also pay off my car, but with an interest rate of 4.5%, I think it might be more worth it to just invest it. Thoughts?

One of my main questions was about retirement. The company I work for does offer 401k with no match, but I am unsure about the funds. They seem to have expense ratios on the higher end. I'll post a link to the actual funds I have available to me so I can get a second opinion (sorry if quality is bad): [https://gyazo.com/97cebaca88a68ce93e21fd1b1223fb47](https://gyazo.com/97cebaca88a68ce93e21fd1b1223fb47)

Basically, with expense ratios like this, I almost wonder if it's more worthwhile for me to open a traditional IRA with Vanguard for lower expense ratios, plus being able to hand pick my funds. If anyone has any suggestions on this or even potential funds that might be decent picks for someone young, that would be nice... or even how much I should contribute, given my situation.

Another question I had was if it'd be financially worth it to cut the 45 minute commute to work and just move up to the city I'm working in. I know I'd have much more fun up there, but my bills would increase by a large amount, since my mom is providing a little bit of a crutch by helping me with food and things while I'm at home. I think to get an apartment there, it would cost me an additional $1,000 per month (at least) in expenses, which would have an effect on my ability to save and invest for the future. At the same time, I'd like to be able to live a little, for once, considering how hard I've pinched pennies up to this point.

I mainly just need a plan of attack for my money, since I actually have more than I thought I'd ever see. This is great, but overwhelming at the same time. I appreciate the help, really, so thanks ahead of time.

Bonus question: I just tried to apply for a Citi double cash card, to take advantage of the 2% cash back benefit. When I applied, my credit was estimated to be around 770 (great, right?). I ended up getting declined, and they said my credit score was 655, which is a ton lower than my estimated credit - what gives? Is there a way to prove that I earn enough to be eligible for this card, or is it purely based on my past credit? I have always paid everything in full on time, but my credit history isn't very long - I figured this would be the kicker.",finance
investing,Thoughts regarding LendingTree Inc. $TREE?,"The stock is down 27% YTD partly because of Q1 earnings, but the company is growing at a phenomenal rate - Q2 EPS is up 70% YoY. 

They are a marketplace for loans and other credit-based offerings such as credit cards. They claim to be the leading participant in this space (although I don't know much about their competitors yet). 

Q2 overall came off as mixed as revenues missed estimates but EPS beat estimates, largely due to disappointing results from mortgage loans (refinances were down but purchases were up - due to rising interest rates) which declined 6% YoY and credit cards which rose only 5% YoY. However, the company earned record revenue for non-mortgage products, growing 44% YoY.

personalfinance,"Credit Card question, am I doing the right thing?","Ok so I have around $1500 of debt on one credit card (Interest of 13.95% PA) and an overdraft on my checking account of $1000 (Interest 15%PA) which I tend to use every pay period.

I've had this debt for ages, most through poor decisions and not really caring. My take home pay is $1560 per fortnight (that's every 14 days, not twice a month). Lateley I've decided to knuckle down and get financially savvy. I;ve been aggressively paying off my credit card the last 2 months (I know my overdraft has a higher interest rate but there's no minimum payments so I would prefer to pay off the CC first) of 500 per fortnight. So at that rate both debts are due to be paid off within 3 months. My budget it tight but not super tight so shouldn't have a huge problem sticking with it for the most part. 

Now I have applied for and been accepted for a new AMEX credit card. It has airpoints rewards with no annual fee plus a 50 point sign up bonus (worth $50) and 1 point per $100 spend. It's basically the only no fee rewards card in New Zealand so i thought I could use it to my advantage now that I am being financially smart and not living beyond my means. The card has a 23% interest rate but it is 0% for the 1st 6 months (no balance transfers). I was going to wait until I had paid off my other card but my laptop dies and I need to pay for another year of car insurance I decided to do it early.

My original plan was to keep paying off the credit card $500 a fortnight but because of the 6 months of 0% interest, it seems like it would be smarter to pay for everything I can with the new AMEX and throw all the actual money into the high interest debt. AMEX isn't accepted every in NZ but  can use it to pay for groceries, alcohol, petrol, phone bill, netflix/Spotify, power, and internet (power and interest are bills for my whole flat but I take care of all the bills so I could pay them w card use t money from the flatmates to pay off debt). All up will be about 410 per fortnight, or double that per month. Then I would just pay the minimum AMEX payment until both high interest debts are paid off. Then throw all that money into AMEX and make sure it's paid off within 6 months. My low rate credit card accepts balance transfers if need be and I still be able to go $1000 into overdraft so I can avoid that 22% interest rate. 

So I should be able to pay $900 per fortnight off my debt in 1.5 months, or 3 paychecks. My AMEX card limit is 5000, and my laptop and insurance will cost around $1000 all up so I should be sweet.

Anyway was just looking for clarification that I'm not being in idiot by doing this? Am I missing something? I've been financially dumb for so long! But it seems like I can pay the least amount of interest doing it this way, not to mention the airpoints are a nice bonus.",finance

Before I allocate the extra $750 to fun money and extra savings, I want to get an idea of how much extra I should be putting towards my loans each month.  I think I prefer the snowball repayment method over the avalanche method.  My idea is that I put an extra $100 towards the loans.  That being said, I believe a majority of it should be going towards the Discover loans since they are higher interest.  (I realize that two of the Navient loans are also relatively high interest rates, but the loan amounts are significantly smaller.)  

Any tips, advice or steers in a straighter course are appreciated.  I'm happy to provide supplement information if need be.  Thanks!

Bitcoin,What if there is a stock market crash?,"Disclaimer: I promise this post isn’t going to be about bitcoin or its exchange rate with any fiat currency.

Of late, I have been thinking about a potential recession. It isn’t a question of ‘if’. In my opinion, it is just a matter of ‘when’.

With student loans, personal debt, automobile debt being at an all time high, a massive correction or a bubble exploding is just bound to happen. 

However, these massive corrections are quite common. Several of them have happened in the past and we recovered from it in one way or the other. 

I think the next one is going to be very worrisome. Almost all the major economies of the world did implement quantitative easing of varying magnitudes. A lot of the global currencies are much weaker than what they are today. Unfortunately, I see QE as a one time trump card. You can play it once and the damage will be minimal. Play it multiple times, the results can be catastrophic. 

This makes me think that some point of time almost all the currencies will lose value at a much faster pace. Turkish Lira, Argentinian Peso are only a few early examples. Major currencies will start hurting is my hypothesis.

I don’t have a crystal ball  (🔮) to guess what is going to happen. The arrival of Bitcoin is just almost miraculous. 

The words that Taleb wrote as a foreword to Saifedean’s book still makes me wonder. Bitcoin can be a very powerful way to keep central banks under a tight leash.

I’ve been in this space for quite some time now. Every time I think about the impact of this, I’m just amazed as to how impactful Bitcoin can be!",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Financed A New Car A Year And A Half Ago And It's Sapping Me Of My Money,"Hello, everyone. I’m a 21 year old man currently needing some serious advice. Around a year and a half ago, I decided it would be a good idea to get a nice car for myself, since I didn’t really have any bills and I made a decent enough amount of money to afford it. I financed a car BRAND-NEW and only now am I realizing this was a horrible mistake. I currently make around $1800-$2200 per month between my two jobs (bussing at a restaurant and caregiving for my brother who was born with cerebral palsy). 

When I financed the car, it was very impulsive. I already had a $300 car payment that wasn’t really hurting me, so I decided I could spend a little more to get a nicer car. Little did I know that I’d be walking out of the dealership with a $550 a month payment, and on top of that, a $270 a month full-coverage insurance plan (I’m on my parents’ insurance). I signed a 5 year agreement at a 4.9% interest rate. Anyways, that’s over $800 dollars that I’m out of per month, not including things like gas, food, cell phone, etc. When I’m only making around $2000 a month, that really takes away from the things that I want to do. I currently live with my parents, so I don’t have rent or utilities or anything like that. I do help out with buying things for my family (food, water, etc.). I want to get my own place soon and this is the main factor in preventing me from achieving this goal.

	I’m very stuck on what I should be doing to make this easier on myself. I love the car, don’t get me wrong, but it’s sapping me financially. I’m basically only allowed $800 dollars a month for myself personally. I want to save as much as possible, so most of that goes right to my savings account. I want to move out ASAP, because I really need my own space in my current life situation. I’m asking anybody out there who can offer some constructive advice on making this a little easier (if at all). Thank you for reading, everyone.

TL;DR: financed a new car, saps me of a huge chunk of my money, makes it extremely hard to get to where I want to be.",finance
personalfinance,Student Loan Help,"I owe apx. 104k, make about 70k/year, and have been making PSLF payments since about 2012 to Fedloan Servicing (I can’t stand them).  My monthly payments are currently about $400. Today I noticed that the amount of qualifying payments I’ve made seemed to be short, so I called Fedloan Servicing. 

The first girl I talked to told me my former university sent them a notification stating I was in school from Nov, 2012 - Aug, 2014 when I was not in school during this time. I was working full time for the government. She told me to call my school’s registrar’s office and have them update the “national registry,” or have the registrar fill out a form that Fedloan Servicing was going to mail me to prove I was not in school during this time.  She indicated that she was sure if I provided the proof I needed that I was not in school during this time the payments I made during this time period would be counted as qualifying payments. 

I checked my e-mail later, and it looked like Fedloan Servicing sent me the wrong form so I called them again. This time when I spoke to a different girl, she told me she could see that I was not in school from Nov 2012 - Aug 2014, and that my former university sent in a “late school forbearance.”  She told me that this put my loans into a reduced payment forbearance (62.50 instead of 156.00/month).  She said because of the forbearance, my payments during this time period did not qualify for PSLF. I never applied for this forbearance, was told about it, or knew about it, and I did what they asked; which was to make on time payments at the amount they told me during this time.  After telling the girl about the reason why I was calling, she said she was going to try to get the 21 months I was denied counted as qualifying payments and put me on hold. When she came back, she said if they removed the forbearance from 2012-2014, that my payments would be short (62.50 vs. 156.00) for that time period and my account would immediately go into default. After she told me there was “nothing they could do,” I explained again how I did nothing wrong, was never informed of the situation, would cost me 8 - 10k in payments, and I’d lose 21 months of credit in qualifying payments, that it was their mistake and they needed to fix it, she talked to her supervisor again. When she came back, she told me she was wrong about how removing the forbearance would place my account into default (her reason was unclear and I do not trust them) , and was going to have my payments during this time reviewed by performing a “payment tracker” to see if they would count as qualifying payments. She told me this is all I can do for now and the process can take up to 120 days. 

I really hope that the 21 months of payments will be approved as qualifying payments, but I definitely do not trust Fedloan Servicing. EVERY SINGLE TIME I talk to a representative, each one tells me something different and inconsistent with what I was previously told. They have no accountability for what they tell people, and I don’t know how they get away with it. It really bothers me how they can mess up and show 0 empathy or accountability, when their actions can really affect others’ lives.  It feels like we’re at the mercy of their incompetence and there’s not much, or nothing, we can do. 

What should I do? Wait and see if the 21 months are approved? Hire an attorney?  I really don’t want to lose credit for almost two years of qualifying payments. 

Thanks in advance.",finance

I need to be able to access it with about 1-2 months notice and my view on the economy in general is that the next year or so will be a little iffy (interest rate rises, London house price index falling etc.), so I really want to invest in something that is cash-like, but my bank account only gives me something like 0.01% interest.

I've been considering premium bonds as an option (they have about 1.4% return tax free, which i think is alright in this market), but does anyone else have any suggestions of easy ways to store this money that are basically Gilt level of safety, but still provide non zero returns?

personalfinance,Need advice regarding lots of cash.,"My grandfather set up a deal with a bank around 20 years ago. He would have a saving account with a relatively high compound interest rate made for each grandchild. In order to keep that interest rate money deposited had to be a fixed amount each month, and once the money would be touched somehow it would be treated as a regular checking account. I don’t know the exact specifics but it is something of that nature.
Anyways 
That deal will be ending next year, and while I won’t have access to the money (without permission) for another 2 years due to an age restriction, next year I will have around 90k in cash sitting in the bank and I was wondering what I could do with it to keep it growing steadily. I am open to any suggestions property, stocks, etc... thanks in advance.

EDIT: I also will soon have access to Barmitzvah money that I received that has not been touched either that would bring the total to 110k.

personalfinance,"Buried under student loans, looking for a way out. (USA)","Good morning, 

Im 27 years old and currently in a ton of student loan debt and I feel like im at my breaking point. I feel like I am one set of new tires away from being bankrupt. See below for my budget. 

 $70,000.00 - Yearly Salary
 $43,979.04 - Yearly Net Salary

Total Allocated - $2,561.13 
Total Remaining - $1,103.79 
Weekly - $275.95 

As you can see, I have a ton of student loan payments that are handcuffing me. I purchased my condo two years ago and since that point I have acquired 7K in credit card debt ( 0%). My car will be paid off in about 9 months and my girlfriend will be moving in with me in 2 months and will be contributing about $400 a month towards mortgage/utilities. My car has a warranty on it that has been paying for repairs up until this point but there is only about a month left on it and it is beginning to rapidly show its age. 
I’m at a point in my life where I would like to start saving for an engagement ring as well as contribute more to retirement ( currently allocating 3% of my check to a company 401k). My goal is to pay off my credit card, save for a ring, and build my savings account (currently has $125 in it).
Currently, my student loans look like this: 

Lender    balance    Interest Rate    Date Due    MinPayment
Sallie Mae $12,665.53    6%         9th     $309.34
Firstmark $ 54,143.73    6.24%    24th    $505.15
Government $21,392.73    5.07    7th      $359.19

I’ve went through and set up direct deposit into two accounts. A bills account and a general account. Everything above goes into my bills account. I have about $500 every two weeks for things like food, entertainment, clothes( I badly need new clothes), and other expenses.

Yesterday I overdrew my “bills” account. This led me to look at refinancing my student loans. I went to firstmark/citizens and saw that I could refinance the $66809.26 of my private loans at 6.49% over 20 years to take my payments to $497.74 + $359.19 = $856.93. This would save me $316.75 a month. Combined with the ~$400 from my girlfriend this would give me an extra $716 a month that I could use to pay off my credit card in less than a year. When my car payment comes up in May, I would be able to add another $277 a month to that which would give me almost $1000.00 a month extra. Once I pay my credit cards off I could then build a savings account while also dumping more than the minimum payments on my student loans to then pay them off early. 

I know that refinancing my student loans will add years to the terms of my loan, and turn the $66K into $124K at the end of the loan. However, I figure if I pay more than the minimum payment when I get out of the hole I am in and dump any extra money (like tax returns, yearly bonuses, and any potential inheritances) into my loans, I would be able to pay them off well before the 20 year mark. These loans and my tight budget are a huge stressor in my life and I feel like I will not be able to keep this up for the next 10 years if I do not do anything. Am I crazy for considering this? 


***How i got to that number of 43K for my Net income was just adding my two checks together and multiplying it by 12. The math is probably off because i get paid 3 times a month twice a year. My bad.",finance

He said that they can work out the money part and commit to a plan for vertical growth. If it doesn't work, he said that they will help me move to a better place - I'm not surprised by that considering that their initial reaction wasn't about me moving on, but to this particular agency which isn't the greatest for the kind of work I do.

Bitcoin,Enigma Protocol Enables Secure Whistleblowing Markets,"[Here is a link to the original article in HubPages](https://hubpages.com/politics/Enigma-Streamlines-Anonymous-Whistleblowing)

**Exhibit A**

On July 12, 2007, at 10:44 EST, a video, later released by Wikileaks, was recorded. ""[Collateral Murder](https://wikileaks.org/wiki/Collateral_Murder,_5_Apr_2010)"", as it was called, was an exposé of indiscriminate airstrikes by two U.S. AH-64 Apache helicopters on eighteen civilians, in Al-Amin al-Thaniyah, New Baghdad in Iraq, ten of which were standing and talking in a public square. Among those killed were Reuters journalist Namir Noor-Eldeen, and driver Saeed Chmagh. There were also some adults and children in a van, which stopped to help - who were shot as well. The two children in the van were seriously injured.

Later tanks arrived at the scene and soldiers joked over their radios that they were driving over dead bodies.

The soldier who had enough of a conscience to release the video, [Bradley Manning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_Manning), was sentenced to 35 years' imprisonment - including the torture of solitary confinement -, reduction in rank, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and a dishonorable discharge. Fortunately, Manning was eventually pardoned by President Obama at the end of his presidency, and released - after nearly ten years of captivity.

Incidentally, I had a trailer of [my book](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1453712690/ref=cm_sw_su_dp) quietly removed from YouTube without explanation, likely because it included some segments from the video. After several inquiries, I have, as of yet, not been offered a single response or explanation of any kind.

While it is now almost universally accepted that the Iraq war was unjustified, its casualties greatly exceed the number of deaths from the twin towers incident, which was the war's *[casus belli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casus_belli)*. The real motives for the war remain shrouded in mystery, as do the details surrounding the American Airlines security breach, and the [similarity of the collapse of the towers to a controlled demolition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Trade_Center_controlled_demolition_conspiracy_theories). [Operation Himmler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Himmler), a similar false flag operation in Nazi Germany, as well as a miriad of modern real-world conspiracies, await detailed investigation, but are hindered due to the likely unpleasant fate of contemporary whistleblowers.

**Exhibit B**

On May 20, 2013, another conscientious whistleblower, who had just quit his job with the NSA, [Edward Joseph Snowden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Snowden), disclosed, according to the Pentagon, around 1.7 million NSA documents, which provided definitive proof of massive, covert snooping on innocent American - and foreign - citizens. His revelation included the PRISM electronic data mining program. He had hoped that this incriminating information would bring about a Constitutional challenge.

But a month later, the U. S. Department of Justice charged Snowden with two counts of violating the [Espionage Act of 1917](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage_Act_of_1917) and theft of ""government property"", and the Department of State revoked his passport. Snowden was stuck in an airport in Russia for over a month, until Russia granted him temporary asylum.

Snowden is now stuck in Moscow, and is unlikely to be pardoned by any politician.

Although his actions have opened debates over mass surveillance, government secrecy, ""national security"" and information privacy, Snowden is being punished for his dedication to human dignity and basic human rights.

**Exhibit C**

[Julian Paul Assange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Assange) founded WikiLeaks in 2006, and came to international attention in 2010, with the publication of Collateral Murder, the Afghanistan war logs, the Iraq war logs, CableGate, and a quarter of a million diplomatic cables in 2010, as well as the Guantánamo files in 2011. Like clockwork, the U S. federal government launched a criminal investigation as the flow of information increased.

Wikileaks publishes incriminating secret information, news leaks, and classified media from anonymous sources. By 2015, WikiLeaks published more than 10 million documents, described by Assange as ""a giant library of the world's most persecuted documents"".

Now a citizen of Ecuador, Assange has remained in its Embassy in London since he was granted asylum there in August 2012. Like Manning and Snowden, Assange is a captive - the fate of the modern big-time whistleblower.


**Building Bulletproof Whistleblowing Markets**

Aside from the fact that a bulletproof platform for whistleblowing needs to better address anonymity - particularly for those on the front lines, Wikileaks has some additional vulnerabilities that can also be resolved via [Enigma's Secret Stores protocol](https://enigma.co/protocol/):

1) Wikileaks is a human organization with a small paid staff and a few thousand volunteers. It could be disrupted. The organization is centralized to the extent that could enable its administration to be shut down. Smart contracts, in contrast, are inherently decentralized, peer-to-peer, and permanent.

2) There is an encrypted “insurance” file, the key to which could fit into Twitter messages, that would be released in the event that Assange is killed or Wikileaks stops functioning. If the key is released, then those decrypted files will reportedly be available instantaneously. The insurance file has reportedly been downloaded more than 100,000 times. There are more than 1,000 sites mirroring Wikileaks and its content. Wikileaks has made available downloadable files containing its entire archive of released materials to date.

Nevertheless, such a release could be prevented if the keyholder(s) disappear. The information contained in the release is temporal, and we must trust that it exists, and that the information would have an impact regardless of when it is released, &amp;c. In short, it relies too much on a human chain and technology that will, at some point, become obsolete.

3) Websites require a domain name, which is obtained through the domain name system (“DNS”), which is hierarchical. Information travels from root servers down to zones containing lower-level servers. A domain can stop working for a variety of reasons. It could be overloaded with traffic intentionally or unintentionally, causing breakdown.

4) Wikileaks has had to switch hosts due to pressure by U.S. Senator Joseph Lieberman. This could happen again. Smart contracts, however, are unstoppable.

5) The means of collecting money, already difficult, could be made even more difficult. Smart contracts allow any digitized currency to be used. The Enigma protocol adds the required layer of anonymity.



It should be immediately apparent that those who achieve power through corruption would like to keep it that way. Unfortunately, whistleblowers often do not come forward because, as we have seen, their lives can be in danger. If these three conscientious individuals came forward against such dangers, imagine how many more will speak openly once the dangers are removed.

As long as witnesses to malicious acts are prevented from coming forward, corruption will reign supreme. Once exposed, the corrupt, and their systems of corruption will retreat.

Whistleblowing should be a constant enterprise with markets for such information adding incentives for providing much needed information. The bigger the conspiracy, the greater the reward for exposing it. Valuable information attracts a premium.

In a bounty system empowered by the Secret Stores protocol, funding parties will be anonymous, whistleblowers will be anonymous, and documentation can be readily reviewed - including evidence.

While some progress has been made over the last few years regarding anonymity in corporate whistleblowing, the leaker still must deal with fallible politicians. There is currently no guarantee that the human to which the incriminating evidence is reported does not have a vested interest in keeping the information concealed, or that the reporter is safe from harm. Over time, the probability that a malicious individual has access to the person's identity increases - particularly when the leak involves high level politics.

By using an automated and fully anonoymous smart contract, no human can ever see the identity of the reporter.

Having Secret Contracts in whistleblowing will, at a minimum, result in less corruption.

If implemented on a large scale, the Secret Store protocol will have the potential to topple tyrannies from small to large.

personalfinance,"Unemployed, Mortgage Advice","My husband collected his last paycheck at the end of June, with which we paid for all of our July bills, including the mortgage. We had sufficient funds to sustain us through the month and pay our bills (except the mortgage) this month. We haven't paid for the August mortgage because we called the mortgage company and asked them if they have a forebearance program of any kind, which they do. We have the paperwork and we're filling it out, but good news--husband got a new job! However, it requires us to relocate. 

When we spoke to the loan officer about looking into getting a new home we found out my husband's credit score is in the toilet (520 or some garbage) mostly because of Fed Loan reporting the months he asked for forebearance as missed payments (plus a couple other things). 

Debt situation isn't pretty. High student loans, a couple credit cards, and a car loan (only like 9k there).

We noticed on the forebearance paperwork for the mortgage that it says it will be reported to credit agencies. Loan officer dude (who seems to be a stand up guy and is freely offering any help he can give us getting the credit stuff fixed whether we buy a home with him right now or not) says we should put our mortgage on a credit card rather than risk having a missed mortgage payment on our credit score. The problem is, we are almost out of cash and husband may not get paid until end of September, so ALL of September's bills+ mortgage would be going on credit cards. Is it really better to rack of $5000+ of credit card debt, including paying credit card bills with other credit cards, than get a forebearance on the mortgage? The very thought makes my stomach hurt. 

We have $80k-$100k equity in our home, and in the current market it should sell quickly, allowing us to pay off whatever debt we accrue in the mean time. However, we are trying to fix our credit to the point we can actually get into some kind of housing, and we probably won't get any kind of payout to the house for at least a couple of months. 

Is loan officer dude right, or are we better off filling out the forebearance paperwork? 

Edit to add: When we sell the house, we will either pay off all of our debt and rent, or pay off all the non-student-loan debt and put a down payment on another house. My husband will make a very healthy income (and has made a healthy income). I'm also planning on upping the amount that I work, but we have kids with special needs and I can't work full time because I have to manage their needs. My immediate problem, and the question I asked, is what do I do with the mortgage payment in the short term? Is it better to pay the mortgage with a credit card until the hous money comes, or move forward with forebearance? 

Second edit: The credit score is low because of errors, not because of any actual non/late payment, so we are in the process of getting it resolved. My score is good (650ish) and will be in the 700s once one error is corrected, which we already have a letter coming from that company to fix. Husband's has way worse errors from a hefty student loan. It will be in the 600s at least once those are cleared up.",finance
personalfinance,School loan debt,"Hi guys first time posting here and would like some advise if possible on how to proceed. I have a student loan from 2008 for about 8000 dollars. There s two different types of loan within that 8000 I forget what they were. I keep seeing that after 7years that debit gets erased from my credit history , is this true? On my credit karma the loans are indeed showing as not current loans. They are taking my federal tax every year and I don't see a penny of that. What should I Do? They offered a settlement and to bring it down to 6000 if I could pay it off in 3 months. Should I take this offer or does my debt truely go away after 7yrs? Can someone explain that part to me please and thank you.",finance
personalfinance,Should I be paying off loans or investing?,"Hello r/personalfinace,

After consulting the flowchart I wanted some second opinions on how aggressively I should be paying off loans. Here is the current breakdown of my debt:

Car loan: $15,000 @3.24%, $439 minimum payment over 3 years

Private Student Loan: $14,500 @3.25%, $123 minimum payment over next 8 years

Government student loans: $18,100 , interest ranges from 3.1% to 4.4%, $270 minimum payment over next 8 years

Since these interest rates are right on the border between low and moderate, I am debating whether to pay more than the minimum payment or set up a Roth IRA to max out. I already get the max employer match to my 401k, contribute more than my out of pocket max to my HSA, and have a 3 month emergency fund (which I will bump up to 6 in the upcoming months). After paying all my bills, expenses, and minimum payments, I have $650/mo left over to put towards loans/investments.

Let me know your thoughts, and thank you for your advice!",finance

personalfinance,Advice on where to spend and/or save money? (Specifically a whole-life insurance policy),"A little while ago I stumbled upon a whole-life insurance policy in my name that a family member had started for me when I was born. The relative that opened it forgot about it years ago and after I discovered it, the relative gave me his or her blessing to do whatever I wanted with the policy. But, I'm having some difficulty deciding what to do.

I am in my mid-20s and make around $45K a year. I am single with no children or other dependents. My work provides me with a life insurance policy of $50K. The whole-life policy has a death benefit of around $65K and a total cash value that would be around $7.5k after withholding for taxes.

My other summarized assets are as follows:
* $6.0K in checking accounts for everyday use
* $4.1K in savings accounts for short term investment or emergency fund
* $8.5K in retirement accounts
* Vehicle valued around $17.5K

My debt is as follows:
* 1.8K student loan @ 4.25%. Minimum payment = $36.56, Extra payment = $113.44, Total = $150.00.
* 2.1K student loan @ 4.00%. Minimum payment = $40.00, Extra payment = $10.00, Total = $50.00.
* $2.8K student loan @ 3.15%. Minimum payment = $54.47, Extra payment = $45.43, Total = $100.00.
* $12.2K car loan @ 2.74%. Minimum = $261.53, Extra = $38.47, Total = $300.00.

Cost of living is fairly cheap in my area, so with that and my strong budget, I am able to pay extra on each of my loans while still enjoying life and being able to save money towards my short term savings and retirement.

I did some research, and from what I've read, whole-life insurance policies are now generally accepted as bad investments and you would be better off getting a term-life policy and investing the money yourself. However, due to being single and childless, I really don't feel that I need more life insurance the amount offered through my company, so I don't have any interest in opening a term-life policy. Below are my the various options I am debating between:

1) Leave the money where it is and/or withdraw it to another non-retirement investing account to keep it for short term savings. I would like to buy a house in the next few years and this would make a good chunk of a down payment in my area. If I remove it I plan on getting an account with Vanguard or some other low fee company and putting it in index funds. However, I know with this option I end up paying interest on my loans that I wouldn't otherwise pay.

2) Withdraw part or all of it and pay off some or all of my student loans. If I only pay off some of my loans, I would choose to pay them in descending interest rate order. I like the idea of having my loans paid off but, I am a little hesitant to spend all the money.

3) Withdraw all of it and use that, my short term investments, and some of my everyday money to pay of my car loan. I like the avalanche method of paying off debt, so I like the fact that it would get rid of the largest monthly payment. However, it is the lowest interest rate of any of my loans and, I'm even more hesitant than Option #2 because it would spend even more money.

I know that on paper the smart thing to do would be to use this unexpected money to pay off my loans but, it scares me to just have the money gone. I have really good job security and my emergency fund is pretty good compared to my expenses so, logically I know I really shouldn't need this amount of money saved. However, emotionally I don't agree with that as much.

So, /r/PersonalFinance, what's my best play here and, how do I mentally make myself okay with what feels like ""losing"" almost $10K.

Thanks!

personalfinance,"Term life insurance policy is expiring, mom has cancer and I'm not sure what to do","10 years ago we goofed and switched from whole life to term inusrance (primerica). She's paying $265/mo for $600,000 coverage.

The policy expiry is coming up in the next 2 months. I just got this letter in the mail which tells me I have a few options if she doesn't want to have another medical exam. So the premium right now is $265/mo.

* If she continues with this plan then after 2 months the premiums are going to bump to $627/mo. Yikes!
* Then they have this thing called ""custom exchange option"". The new premium ($588) is schedule to remain level for the duration of the plan. The coverage will remain level for 10 years but will decrease every year until the age 100. Wtf why is the premium lower and this decrease coverage stuff?
* Option 3 is to decrease death benefit amount and thus have premium decrease.

She's in her 60s and this is her second time having cancer so I'm sure she's never getting approved for insurance again. My brain hurts and I feel like an asshole thinking about this. Perhaps it's something to do with betting against her living or not. They initially gave her 8 mo to live but then bumped that to 4-5 years. Her oncologist is optimistic since the cancer hasn't gotten worse (or better) for the last 1.5 years. Hopefully this is a good sign and she begins improving. If I'm optimistic about her health then getting insurance is pointless right? I feel like I'm over complicating it because of the sunk cost fallacy.

So the question is **does it make financial sense to continue with life insurance**?

I feel like this I'm buying options with month to month payments ($600 x 12 x (10 years) = $72,000.... in one scenario I lose 72K on the other I get 600K (minus 72K). I'm leaning towards cancelling since I could just save those premiums and be up 72K without any risk.

Some more info:

* I'm the only beneficiary.
* I'm set to inherit the house (\~1mill value nearly paid off), although there's a 300K lien from a conman that'll make selling it pain (I would love for some advice on dealing with this).
* I have \~180K in cash lying in various bank accounts, although most of it is stuck in corporations that I'm withdrawing from slowly (advice from accountant). Maybe I should invest? lol
* I'm not working (aside from gigs/volunteering) due to physical and mental issues and also being her caretaker.
* We both live in the house. We have basement tenants. At peak capacity we could take in 3 more roommates but mom ain't down for that anymore. If she died I'd prefer to keep the house rather than sell it. Since there's no more mortgage I might barely break even although emergency expenses would put it back in the red.

Anyways I appreciate anyone taking the time to read this.

personalfinance,Should I pay off a low interest auto loan that has gap insurance?,"My wife and I are looking to buy a new house in the middle future (5 or so years, I would think). I've built an emergency fund, and would like to start trying to get the down payment for the new house built up. 

We've just paid off the last of the student loans, so the only outstanding debt beyond our existing home loan is the car. We still owe around $13k, but the loan is at a 1.99 % interest rate. Also, we purchased gap insurance for the car, which was a one-time payment when we financed the vehicle. 

My gut feeling is that it doesn't make sense to pay off the car right now - the interest rate is low, so I don't gain a whole bunch by paying it off, and then also the gap insurance won't pay anything after the car is paid off. 

I know the best decision is probably to pay more on the existing mortgage, but that only builds equity, which (I believe) doesn't get me anything until I actually sell the existing house. I don't want to be in a homeless limbo where I'm dependent on selling the existing house before I can finance the second house. 

The tl;dr I guess is that I'd like to do something more with the surplus income, but the auto loan is the last outstanding debt and I don't want to do something that's going to get the money tied up. 


**:EDIT:** - I better articulated the question in response to /u/Nerdy_Narwhal89 's comment below:

&gt; The gap insurance covers the difference between outstanding balance and the car's valuation, so I guess the better question would be how does the insurance company value the car? At what point does the gap insurance stop adding value to the loan?

Now I don't have any cash to pay for his second surgery that is scheduled for Thursday(heart bypass). I live in US and he also does but was in vacation when this incident happen and so the surgery is happening in Mexico.

I was planning on getting a personal loan, and talking to the Hospital they are willing to allow me to do 15k downpayment and then pay for the rest in 2k installments in 6 months. I would rather get the 25k but if it's not possible 15k would be suffice.

My current financial status is:

1. Income of 73k.
2. Collateral of 68k(it's a food truck).

Every month I save an approximately 2500. This is after my car payment, rent, and utilities.

My question is when heading to the Credit Union, I was told to take in my employer verification, and my income verification. I have those two things ready. Now how can I mention collateral? Their online application doesn't have anything to mention regarding collateral.

Taking a look at Avant it said I could afford to get up to 15k personal loan but the interest rate was a whooping 35%. The federal credit union said if I qualified it would be 13-18%.

I plan on paying the loan back with my yearly bonus which is around 6-8k, and be doing payments of 1-2k per month.

personalfinance,Considering Refinancing Student Loans- Worried About Hit Credit Will Take From Lower Age of Accounts,"Like the title says, considering refinancing my private loans since I have a new job that pays a LOT more. I’d love a lower monthly payment, and I think my credit is decent enough that I could get lower interest rates than the shit ones I have now. 

However when I look at my credit score on places like Mint, Credit.Com, and Nerd Wallet. I see the one major thing that’s holding my credit back is the average age of my accounts. And these loans I want to refinance are the oldest accounts I have. Closing them and opening a new account will surely drop the average age of my accounts- and probably make my score take a hit. 

I can pay the monthly fine, and with my new job it will be even easier to pay and save (job has 401k with automatic 4% match, and may match up to 6% at end of the year depending on on their budget since they are a non-profit). Refinancing would, hopefully, just give me even more breathing room... but I want to balance out the impact a brand new account (and closing the old ones) will have on my credit score, and also balance the probability that a refi will give me a longer loan term (at my current rate I will pay off these loans in 10 years).

personalfinance,Undergrad Senior - Savings Account vs Paying Loans,"Hi all! Long time lurker first time poster. I'm an undergrad college student with 3 semester lefts (4.5 year plan, woo!). 21.5 years old and already incredibly anxious about money. :-)

I'm just starting to take out loans, due to some fortunate extended family help. My parents are not able to pay anything, and do not want to take out a lower rate, 7.595% government Parent PLUS loan in their name. Which for a lot of reasons, I totally get. I need to start taking out private loans to pay for about $28,000 of school. I will also have about $9,000 in government Stafford (subsided and unsubsidized loans).

I'm looking at applying to a Discover loan and here are the stats. For Fall '18, I will need $8,970. I will also need roughly the same, but slightly higher, for Spring and Fall '19. (My school does not lock in tuition costs, yay!)

Need $8,970 loan for fall. 

2 options: 

variable interest rate is 9.240% without co-signer

\-$70.39 monthly in school interest payment 

\-9.240% interest rate 

\-$92.29/month after school

\-$18,174.93 estimated total paid 

fixed interest rate is 10.640% without co-signer

\-$81.06 monthly in school interest payment

\-10.640% interest rate locked in

$99.97/month after school 

\-$ 19,791.99

each have 15 year loan repayment

Of course I will try and convince my parents to cosign but I am not sure.

So roughly, I will be $28,000-30,000 in debt minus the interest. Whatever course I take, I plan to pay the about $100 interest payment to reduce debt - even during school, and even though the interest payment plan is less than that ($70-80).

\-------------------------

Now onto the life decisions. I am an incredibly frugal person, I put so much money of my paychecks into savings. I've spent $6,272 so far out of pocket for college thus far. I work part time (about 20 hours a week), and resell stuff online in basically all my free time to make money.

I currently have $6,035.16 in savings (an online savings account for that better interest rate). I have my retirement fund started with about $200 in it from my prior job that did contribution matching for the 6 months I was a part time employee.

By the time I finish college, so in the next year and a half, it's always been my goal to have $10,000 in savings. That doesn't sound like a ton of money to most, but someone who's basically only worked part time, and sometimes full time in summers, it's a big chunk.

I currently live with my parents and make about $300-400 a month at my real job. I spent about $175 on transportation, as I commute from the suburbs to a major city. I don't pay rent. I pay my own medical bills and car insurance. I basically am left with $50ish for two weeks where I currently am from this paycheck. All of my resale/flipping money goes towards my savings account, other expenses, or sometimes fun things. I know I can swing the $100ish monthly payment for the in-school interest payment for the loans, but am not sure what I will have left after that.

My savings account, as it is, will last me at least 9-12 months if I were to have to live on it and not pay rent. If I had to magically start paying rent, it would probably cover about 4-6?

**Additionally, do I take the fixed rate or variable interest plan?**

CryptoCurrency,"Cryptokidnapping, or how to lose $3 billion of bitcoin in India","Investigators across Gujarat and in the Indian capital of New Delhi say complaints about crypto frauds began pouring in after the U.S. cease-and-desist letters.

Accusations of tax evasion and police corruption, a kidnapper who was kidnapped, a fugitive politician, and billions in bitcoin lost. This is crypto-trading Gujarat-style.

The ingredients are part of an investigation in Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s home state into allegations that investors poured cash into a bitcoin-based Ponzi scheme that could exceed the country’s largest banking scandal. The fallout extends as far as Texas and has embroiled a former lawmaker, tarnishing Modi’s ruling party months before an election.

It began in February, when property developer Shailesh Bhatt charged into the Home Minister’s office in Modi’s home state of Gujarat, claiming he had been kidnapped by a group of policemen and told to pay 200 bitcoin, worth some $1.8 million at the time, for his release. He said he had nowhere else to go.

The state’s elite Criminal Investigation Department was called in and the evidence it has uncovered points to a potential fraud on an epic scale. Eight policemen have been indicted and suspended pending trial. The abduction was allegedly spearheaded by Bhatt’s associate, Kirit Paladiya, and masterminded by Paladiya’s uncle Nalin Kotadiya, a former lawmaker in Modi’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, according to Ashish Bhatia, the lead CID investigator. Bhatt has been charged too, as the allegations of kidnapping widened.

Paladiya is now in jail, facing charges of abduction and extortion, and Bhatt and Kotadiya are both absconding, according to police. Kotadiya posted a video via Whatsapp in April denying wrongdoing and saying he’d informed authorities about the crypto scam, said Prashant Dayal, a senior Gujarati journalist who broke the story.

In the video, reposted on Youtube, Kotadiya says Bhatt is responsible for the scam and threatens to release evidence that could implicate other politicians. Both Bhatt and Paladiya have denied wrongdoing, according to their lawyers.

Between late 2016 and early 2017, Bhatt invested in BitConnect, a cryptocurrency firm that was being promoted in Gujarat by a man called Satish Kumbhani, according to Bhatia, the CID investigator, in an interview at his office late June.

Kumbhani is one of the founders of BitConnect, which has allegedly scammed individuals across the globe, according to Crypto Watchdogs, a group of six investors who’ve filed a U.S. federal lawsuit against the company. The firm recruited clients worldwide to deposit bitcoin and receive BitConnect coins they could lend at interest rates of more than 40 percent a month. The interest they earned was higher if they recruited others to invest. Attempts to contact the company and Kumbhani for comment were unsuccessful.

As the price of bitcoin soared last year from less than $1,000 to more than $19,700, so did BitConnect’s value. Bhatt and other investors in Gujarat poured bitcoin worth $3.2 billion into Bitconnect, according to Bhatia.

The vast inflows from Indian investors were partly the result of Modi’s shock move in November 2016 to invalidate banknotes worth 15 trillion rupees in an effort to curb tax evasion, according to a chartered accountant in Gujarat. Modi, who faces federal elections in early 2019, ruled the state as chief minister for more than a decade before becoming prime minister in 2014 with the promise of stamping out corruption.

As a result of Modi’s 2016 demonetization, about 45 billion rupees ($650 million) flowed to Gujarat’s port city of Surat, to be hidden away in assets including cryptocurrencies, said the accountant, who asked not to be identified because his clients include some of the city’s biggest diamond and textile traders.

Surat, the heart of the scandal, is famed for its entrepreneurial merchants who travel the world to set up a “dhandha,” or family business. Their tight-knit communities dominate Antwerp’s diamond trade and own a quarter of U.S. motels.

In the days following Modi’s demonetization -- when Indians were given about 60 days to bank their higher-value banknotes or lose them -- Google marked a surge in queries from the country on how to launder untaxed cash, or black money. Most of the searches came from Gujarat, Google Trends show.

One answer was to switch to cryptocurrencies. Crypto chatrooms around the world soon were abuzz about a surge in demand from Indians who were paying a 25 percent premium for bitcoin.

“After demonetization, we were watching India,” said Kiran Vaidya, a product manager at Toronto-based U.Cash and a blockchain adviser to Canadian banks. “We’d seen how bitcoin rose after the Greece economic crisis and similarly after things went south in Venezuela. The volumes were so high that it was obviously people who had the capacity to move markets.""

While the initial rush may have been black money, there were cases of people selling houses and cars in hopes of doubling their investment, said the CID’s Bhatia.

Then, on Jan. 4, 2018, the state of Texas filed a cease-and-desist order against BitConnect. North Carolina followed five days later. The news came as the price of bitcoin crashed.

Amid the ensuing market turmoil, the Reserve Bank of India announced measures that virtually banned crypto transactions. Cryptocurrency exchanges responded with a lawsuit that is due to resume hearings in the Supreme Court in September.

Investigators across Gujarat and in the Indian capital of New Delhi say complaints about crypto frauds began pouring in after the U.S. cease-and-desist letters.

Still, those who had been trying to hide untaxed cash were in a quandary. If they went to the authorities, they would have to declare their investments.

So Bhatt and nine accomplices -- including Paladiya -- kidnapped two BitConnect representatives in Surat and demanded 2,256 bitcoin as ransom, CID investigators alleged. Paladiya, however, wanted more. He contacted his influential uncle, Kotadiya, and tapped the latter’s network in the local police to double-cross Bhatt and allegedly extort his bitcoin, according to allegations in police documents and interviews with investigators.

They were confident of success, gambling that Bhatt wouldn’t go to the authorities and certain that the anonymity of bitcoin would make the heist untraceable, according to the investigators.

They were wrong. Bhatt pressed charges.

Bhatt himself has gone “underground” -- Indian parlance for hiding to avoid arrest -- because his appeal for bail was rejected, said his lawyer Rupesh Rupareliya. In a July 26 telephone interview, Rupareliya said Bhatt denies any wrongdoing and says that Paladiya handled all the bitcoin transfers as Bhatt wasn’t tech savvy.

Paladiya’s lawyer Yogesh Ravani denied any wrongdoing by his client and said Paladiya was a victim of the kidnappers.

On July 5, the opposition Congress Party held a press conference demanding the ruling BJPinvestigate the matter in Gujarat.

Kotadiya is no longer with the BJP and since the Gujarat government initiated the investigation, it shows the government is dealing with the matter, said GVL Narasimha Rao, a New Delhi-based BJP spokesman. He asked Bloomberg News to speak to the state administration about Kotadiya’s threat to reveal more political involvement. Jitendrabhai Vaghani, BJP president for Gujarat, answered a call but disconnected when told the question was about the cryptocurrency fraud. He didn’t answer subsequent calls.

The BJP had its worst showing in more than two decades when state elections were held in Gujarat last December. Shailesh Kumar, Asia director with political risk advisory Eurasia Group, said the alleged scam follows a string of high-profile frauds.

“If more names of politicians do come out, there could be a price to pay,” he said. “The government will have to find the absconders and bring them back.”

personalfinance,Bank of the Internet is holding my $1200 deposit hostage. Help?,"I got tired of paying $12/month for Chase's checking account (I'm a freelancer, hence, no direct deposit to waive the fee) so I opened a free checking account with Bank of the Internet. After my account was created, I used mobile deposit to deposit $1200 into the checking account.

For a few days, my account balance was $1200, but the available balance was still $0. I waited until the available balance reflected the deposit, then I submitted a payment to pay one of my Chase credit cards.

A few days later Bank of Internet reversed the payment (it was about $850), and Chase charged me a $25 payment return fee.

I called B of I and they said the payment was reversed because accounts younger than 30 days old are subject to a 7 day holding period for deposits. After 30 days, it's a 5 day period. I asked them why did my account show that the balance was available if it wasn't, and they assured me that I was seeing things and the the available balance never read $1200...

Fine. Lesson learned. I didn't read the fine print. I guess.

I waited a few more days and submitted another payment to a Chase credit card for $1200. Bank of I submitted the payment, then reversed the payment again. Chase charged me another $25 for return payment fee.

I asked them why the second payment was reversed and they said my account was 'restricted'. Apparently they need me to send them a picture of my driver's license, and a picture of a utility bill for my mailing address before I can have access to my money. My initial deposit was July 17th, so we're approaching a month that I haven't been able to use my money. 

I asked them who should be responsible for these $25 fees, and they said they can't pay another banks fees...

What is my recourse here? Obviously I'm fed up with Bank of I. Any other options other than jumping through their hoops, get access to my money, withdraw it, close my account, and blast them on every review site I can find?",finance

personalfinance,Best approach to paying student loans,"Hi, all.

I’m looking for advice on the most efficient way to pay back my student loans. The info is as follows:

Loan B: $3,977 @ 5.84% interest

Both are direct federal unsubsidized loans.

With my current budget, I can afford to pay $300/month towards my student loans. Of that $300, I’m currently allocating $200 to loan A and $100 to loan B. Once loan B is paid off, I’ll pay $300 toward loan A.

Is this the best/most efficient way to pay off my loans? Or is there a different way I could allocate the $300 that might be more effective?

personalfinance,Pay mortgage on credit card (hear me out!),"I have a new credit card with a $17500 credit limit, and a 0% interest 1 year balance transfer available. On my mortgage, I have a 4.125% interest rate, but I also have PMI of $72/month. I can get PMI removed at a 78% LTV ratio. In order to get to a 78% LTV ratio I need to reduce the principal by $15k more on the mortgage. I will then have a 78% LTV ratio, and can eliminate the $72/month PMI, on top of saving on interest of mortgage since the balance will be $15k less. I can pay off the entire $15k over the corse of the year before the 0% APR runs out.

By my calculations, doing this will save me $864 (in a years worth of PMI). And $618.75 (4.125% of 15k saved in interest from reduced mortgage principal). So it could save me $1482.75 vs just paying the $15k towards the mortgage over a year.

Risks include not being able to pay the $15k off in a year and getting charged high cc interest on whatever is left and also I am assuming this will decrease my credit score since it will be a high credit utilization % on this card for a whole year. What does everyone think?",finance
CryptoCurrency,Distributed Credit Chain (DCC) – World’s First Distributed Credit Agency on The Blockchain,"**Distributed Credit Chain (DCC)** is an  integrated ecosystem of distributed financial services which aims to  break the monopoly of traditional centralized financial institutions.  DCC is aimed at providing fair financial services to all the providers  and users involved in a credit transaction, so that each participant in  the transaction is remunerated adequately without scenarios where we  have one party exploiting the other. This distributed credit services  provided by DCC ensures inclusive finance.

It is an open-truth that centralized credit providers such as banks  are highly exploitative in nature. Their centralized business structure  gives them the ability to rip off users of their services in ways that  are absolutely not economical to these users. Centralized credit  services providers basically exploit the excessive premiums that result  from information asymmetry that exist among participants in a credit  transaction. I will be detailing some of the current issues that make  centralized credit services by banks not appealing to users below:

* High Transaction Cost
* Decreased Efficiency
* Profiteering

**High Transaction Cost**  
 Basically, the modus operandi of centralized financial institutions is  to share the cost of non interest-earning operations with the users. Bad  debts which are irrecoverable debts are also shifted to the users of  credit services by these credit services institutions. This represents  additional to costs to borrowers who will still have to deal with  high-interest rates from these highly exploitative financial  institutions. But in a case where these financial institutions are  monopolistic in nature, borrowers are forced to pay these high  transaction costs due to lack of alternatives.

**Decreased Efficiency**  
 Borrowing from credit agencies involves bureaucratic processes of risk  evaluation and creditworthiness evaluation of the prospective borrower.  In carrying out these processes, a lot of time and other resources and  expended. This represents waste of resources and decreased efficiency on  the part of these credit agencies when verifying those that will not  eventually meet the risk criteria. This also represents waste of  precious time and resources on the part of the part of prospective  borrowers who has expended time and other resources in applying for the  credit.

**Profiteering**  
 Research has it that 80% of financial institutions profits come from the  premium that they get between the interest rate and the lending rate.  Credit agencies have deviated from their primary purpose of serving  customers to making profits. They squeeze out lenders by giving them  meager interests on their savings while charging exorbitant amount of  interest on loans taken by these users. This widens the premium between  interest rate and lending rates thereby making these financial  institutions some insane profits at the expense of their users.

worldpolitics,Variable Voting Power,"There is much to love in the Paul Verhoeven classic, Starship Troopers. But between all the sci-fi action goodness, the social satire, and T 'n A, one thing has stuck with me all these years: needing Citizenship to vote, and only being able to acquire citizenship through military service.

I don't think it's a great idea, but the root of the concept has never really left my mind: reassessing the democratic assumption that *every* able bodied man and woman, past the age of majority, would have the inalienable right to vote, and that each of those votes would be *exactly equal*.

It's never made sense to me. The juxtaposition of 18 year-old Brittney, with her yoga pants and Starbucks, having a vote that is counted in equal measure with 75 year-old Carl, the Korean War veteran who put five kids through local universities and colleges, and who has been diligently paying taxes for 55 years, has struck me as a total absurdity.

With that in mind, I've recently composed a simple idea that I'm just as excited to send out into the world, as to hear constructive, meaningful feedback.

**The tl;dr version:**

**You can increase the power of your vote**. A person's vote starts with a 'weighted power' of 1, and can increase, providing an individual greater democratic influence. A vote can have its weighted power increased over time, with study, active political involvement, service, and investment. When results are tallied, an individual's vote is not counted as a single vote, but accord to their WVP.

Example: Bill (WVP 5), Susan (WVP 1), and Fred (WVP 53), all cast their votes for the local mayor Candidate A. Jeff (WVP 12,) Carl (WVP 24,) and Bethany (WVP 10,) cast their vote for Candidate B. The results: Candidate A = 59, Candidate B = 46. Candidate A would win, even though three people voted for each candidate.

**Expansion of the Idea**

When a person reaches the age of majority, or when they successfully become a citizen through immigration, they have a single vote with a Weighted Vote Power of 1. (From now on referred to as WVP.)

**Time**

Their vote increases in WVP naturally as time passes, representing their continual investment in the country through taxes and their maturing comprehension of what defines the culture and direction of the country at large. The scale could be something as simple as: every year as an active, tax-paying inhabitant of the country, the WVP of your vote increases by X points. Maybe 1 point, maybe as many as 10, with an eventual cap.

The WVP that can be acquired with time must have a cap in order to provide a balance between the disinterested and unqualified elderly, and the politically savvy, diligent citizen of any age.

**Service**

Service to the country and its people would add WVP. Military service, volunteering, holding political office, etc, would each add value. Joining the military could add a flat value, with a incremental value over time from tours of duty or based on your record of service. The same could exist for number of days or hours spent volunteering at local community support organizations, and for time spent working politically in the community.

Whatever the list would eventually be, the essence is that by actively working in your community, serving your fellow countryman, protecting its values and defending its culture and virtues, your vote would increase in WVP.

**Study**

Weighted Vote Power can be gained by studying relevant topics and acquiring accreditation. Tests could be set up that could be challenged so that with or without official study, any individual can prove they have useful knowledge in an array of fields that are relevant to the operation of the country--political studies, economics, history, foreign affairs, etc.

Additionally, certificates in those same areas of study would count towards your WVP. The capacity of an individual to understand the ramifications of their decisions would be reflected. In essence, knowledge would equal power.

**Investment**

Before I speak it, I know how controversial an idea it would be to allow people to buy voting power, but I believe it to be a reasonable and necessary addition to the system. Every dollar spent in a country improves the economy--it enriches the lives of its citizens. The generation of wealth is as much a service to the people as military service or volunteering, as wealth can't help but enrich--job creation, market expansion, real-estate value improvement, expansion of services and infrastructure, etc.

Ergo, the amount of taxes an individual pays directly relates to their WVP. This would not be a relative figure, but an accrued figure. In other words, each person would have a 'Total taxes paid,' which would equal a WVP increase, and this system would have a cap.

With this in mind, voluntary taxes could be paid. An individual could decide to spend a greater portion of their income on taxes in order to purchase greater influence over how those tax dollars are spent, and with the cap in place, a foreign billionaire would be unable to buy an immediate and unfair advantage, but would be able to buy an amount of influence that parallels his investment in the country.

**Active Political Involvement**

Every time an individual votes in any type of election--for the local mayor, provincial or state representative, referendums, national/federal elections, etc--they gain WVP. This would not only encourage greater participation, but would reward people who perpetually make the effort to be involved in the democratic process. A person could gain substantial WVP over a disinterested peer, simply through involvement in the democratic process.

**Losing WVP**

Acting contrary to the reasonable, self-evident, public-good would result in losing WVP. This topic is difficult for me to define because of the myriad activities which would, at first, seem to be contrary to the public good, and yet are vital to the health of a democratic society. Some qualifiers are obvious: being convicted of crimes like murder or theft would cost a person significant WVP.

Defining the system such that devaluing a person's WVP to at or below zero needs consideration and discussion.

**WVP Confidentiality**

I think it goes without saying that a person's WVP would have to be kept strictly confidential!!

**Summary Thoughts**

I'm sure there are dozens of other ways a person could increase the value of their vote that I haven't thought of, and I'm equally certain there are glaring flaws in this idea that would need substantial, carefully crafted protections or solutions to avoid political catastrophe, which is why I'm happy for the discussion. But I think it's a discussion worth having and I wholly believe the idea of variable voting power would wildly and powerfully shape the way a democratically governed country would operate.

In the US, the Democrats couldn't count on tens of thousands of votes from illegal immigrants because all of them could be outweighed by a few hundred true-blue American voters. In Canada a politically inept, bumbling pretty-boy like Trudeau couldn't have been elected by scores of uninformed, young voters. In the UK, the referendum on Brexit may have been comically one-sided, making future debate on the subject a fools-errand.

I've always loved the quote: ***""Democracy is the worst form of government, except for all the others.""***

It's inspired me to continually ponder ideas that could improve the system--that could fix the big problems and undo the great harms. There are so many potential systems and solutions that haven't been attempted, and I'm ever curious about what the ramifications of their adoption would be.",finance

personalfinance,"If a recession is imminent, does it make sense to liquidate long term holdings and rebuy after market drops?","My info:
-19 yr old College student

-On full scholarship

-Savings account, emergency fund, etc all squared away

-around $1000 in stock (mostly Home Depot w/ some Coke) waiting to be owned for a year so I can sell them and not face short term cap gains tax

-around $15,400 in VFIAX (the subject of this post)

Premise:
From my view and from my research, as far as I can tell, nearly everyone, from amateur investors to financial experts, is in agreement that a recession is imminent within the next 1-3 years. Every financial website, major news organization, and financial YouTube channel that I’ve seen has stated this. It’s been 10ish years since the last recession, which is a relatively long expansion period in the context of the last hundred years or so. Looking at the US boom-bust cycle, it certainly seems like we are more than overdue for a recession. In theory, I could sell my VFIAX shares rn for around $262 a share, hold onto the cash until after the recession hits, and then buy many more shares of VFIAX and other comparable financial instruments. 

Ideal scenario:
I sell my VFIAX shares, which I bought several months ago with the money I got from selling stocks (which I’d bought, held, and reinvested in over the course of my lifetime at the advice of my parents). I sell my 58.3 shares at 262 a share, take a tax hit bc of my quick turnaround, and put the money in the bank. A recession hits in the next 1-2 years and the market contracts 30-50%. I buy back in, aiming for just after the price has started to rebound (as long as I’m back in before it’s close to being fully rebounded, I’m okay). The money I got from selling 58.3 shares at $262 should be, near the height of a recession, enough to buy between 90-120 shares or, more likely, buy a similar amount of VFIAX shares as I previously had and use the rest of the money to invest in similarly styled funds, depending on what looks desirable at the time. In this ideal scenario, the money I lose to short term cap gains tax, along with the possible inflationary cost of having my money in the bank and the missed-out-on dividends from VFIAX would be dwarfed in the long term by the massive gains I would receive following buying into the market at such a low price point. 

Fallibility (that I am aware of):
As is the nature of a recession, no one really knows when it’s coming or what will cause a massive market correction. Popular sentiment and observation of the US boom-bust cycle would certainly indicate that we’re “due”, but that’s not really a good enough reason. So far as I know, we could be at the very end of a ten year expansion, or midway through a historic 20 year expansion. If the boom continues for another 3 or 5 or 10 years, am I prepared to watch my money sit in the bank, either accruing minuscule interest or losing value due to inflation while the VFIAX stock that I could’ve held onto surges in value? What if after some years, a minor recession hits and by the time I make my moves, the potential dividends I miss out on are equal to or greater than the additional shares I am able to purchase at the decreased price? 

My options (as I see them):
Do nothing. When the recession hits, take a safe amount of my savings + whatever liquidity I can muster (certainly $1000ish can come from the remaining stocks I plan to sell anyway) w/o overextending my means, and invest in low-cost, diversified market tracking funds. Easy, safe.

Act now. Seeing as how I do not know when the recession is coming, if I am going to sell, I should sell ASAP, while it’s still a sellers market. In this scenario, I would need to resolve myself to the idea that a recession is inevitable, and that it will pull the current price of my holdings (which I am satisfied with as long term investments) way down to the point that I can buy many more shares of said holdings and thus reap many times the benefits 30-50 years from now when, as I believe will happen, the market has recovered and substantially grown. I could sell a portion of my VFIAX and thus not entirely commit myself, but the questions regarding the potential issues and potential profit remain the same in terms of whether or not I should take any action at all.

Questions:
What am I missing? Am I an idiot for wanting to do this? Are there unforeseen downsides? If this is as good an idea as I think it is, why doesn’t everyone do this? All advice and comments are much appreciated.

Edit: Whoa, okay. Literally every comment telling me this is a bad idea leads me to believe this is a bad idea. The new plan is to sell nothing, and save what cash I can to buy more stocks if and when prices drop. I appreciate all the responses. I guess I just needed a reminder of the tremendous downside and all the things that can go wrong. Thank you!",finance

\-Lease ($734, ending 7/2019)

\-Discover loan ($?, starting 11/2018)

I'm 21, living at home, making $35,000/yr. as an EMT. I'm gaining experience before I apply to PA school; if I don't get in, I'll likely apply to a graduate (MPH) program.

If I'm admitted to PA school, my debt will balloon but the salary would be somewhat comparable, right ($100k/yr. with \~$200k debt)? I've also noticed that many public health professions (that pay well) require a master's. So, the only way to improve my situation, it seems, is to plunge myself further into debt.

How should I even approach this? How should I manage my payments? Should I just save every extra penny? When can I even refinance my private loans? Is it even possible to live the life I want, albeit in the future? Can this even be overcome? 

I'm looking for any suggestions, any advice, as it'll be appreciated all the same!

personalfinance,"Question regarding a deposit &gt;$10,000 I made 2 years ago","In mid 2016 I purchased my first home. Part of the agreement included the previous owner's paying for repairs that totaled ~$12,000. Instead of reducing the sale price, or the owner's fixing it themselves, they cut a check for the assessed value of the repairs. After the closing, I started a new account at a new bank, deposited the check in full, and over the course of the next 6 months I used that money to pay for the repairs. Once the work was complete I closed the account.

It recently came to my attention, as I undersatnd it, that all deposits over $10,000 are reported to the Feds (IRS?). Well, I never claimed that money as additional income. I've also yet to receive any formal notices from the Feds or the State regarding this money.

**CASH IS KING.**

To Understand money more better, we need to know the ROOT of new age money.

There was a time before 400 Years when people used gold as medium to exchange goods or services. People use to pawn their gold to a particular gold smith in German and use to get GDR(Gold Deposit Receipt) simply a receipt to redeem gold when needed, but as dealing with gold as medium was not much practically comfortable, people started to use the receipt(GDR) to buy and sell goods and services, as every one recognised and believed the receipt was backed by gold with known gold smith. Once it was popular and became a practice among people to use receipt as medium to exchange value, few smart lads started to create same kind of receipt, now this became a problem to people and gold smith, that’s when historic change happened not only did the goldsmith found a way to create receipts which were not easy to forge also he saw opportunity to create more receipts than the gold he held, that’s when RESERVE BANKING started and from there he perfected the art of balancing the number of receipts which did not create inflation at the same time enough receipts were available in market. The receipts are called as currency in modern days

**RESERVE BANKING**

Once they perfected the art of reserve banking, they with new found wealth and knowledge kept introducing Reserver Central Banks all over Europe and World with the help of England. England which colonized many countries was funded by the same bankers who made fortune with and Gold, Diamonds looted from world and introduction of LSE(London Stock Exchange).

In early 1900 as England was loosing control and USA being the next World power, these banker had to capture US financial system, with hook and crook(for inquisitive minds a few bread crumbs, sinking of titanic, brenton woods) they introduced Federal Reserve Bank in USA

**World Wars**

When the whole world was fighting, USA did not participate in those wars instead they choose to sell arms to all nations and strategically they accepted payments only in GOLD, so by end of two wars almost entire planets gold was with USA( Fort Knox).

After world war was over nations did not have gold to trade between nations but as every one knew US dollar was backed by gold so every nation started using dollar as international currency as part Brenton-Wood( 1944) agreement and that made USD very valuable. Slowly USA started to export inflation to other countries and one fine day they could print more USD as there was not enough GOLD to back their USD, so president Nixon did

&gt;“ unilateral cancellation of the direct international convertibility of the United States dollar to gold.” — &gt;!1971!&lt;

which means no nation could convert USD to gold which was the underlying faith for nations to accept USD as international reserve currency. France started to question this move and followed by other nations. That’s when USA had to think of creative solution for this crisis.

**OIL — The Black Gold and SWIFT**

With help of Saudi Arabia(OPEC) USA had forged a deal where only Crude Oil would be sold in USD, the technology or payment rail was SWIFT. SWIFT used USD as underlying currency to transfer value between nations. So if some bank wanted to send money India to Japan they had to use SWIFT payment network which in turn converted INR-USD and from USD-JPY

&gt;SWIFT was founded in Brussels in&gt;! 1973!&lt;

Many countries tried to break the the reserve currency status of USD, but everytime it was not very successful and the countries which tried that had to face server retribution from USA, as USA had built a very powerful military-industrial complex through out the world.

**Asian currency crisis**

Thailand triggered the Asian financial crisis by delinking the baht from the US dollar. The Bank of Thailand cut the baht loose on 2 July &gt;!1997!&lt; after the currency , had been under sustained attack by speculators(Hedge Funds from USA and London). This crisis spread to Asia.

**War on terror**

When Iraq wanted to sell their oil in Euro by ditching USD, not only Saddam Hussain dreamt of it, he also went and commissioned a Oil Trade Exchange with high speed internet and he also had done pilot testing, that’s when September 11 attack happened and America had to go for War on terror and they believed Saddam had Weapon of Mass Destruction(WMD) and they destroyed him and his ambitions to trade in Euro

Leaders from Venezuela, Libya(Gaddafi) and Iran tried the same but ended up dead or wounded very badly

**Petro Yuan**

China has been watching this and they knew it was not easy to bring down USD as they ere the major holder of USD as foreign reserve and they would suffer very much, at the same time USA debt was increasing massively which means, logically USA could not pay interest for at least a century, so China started a long strategic move where they slowly replaced USD with Yuan like asking euro zone to accept Yuan, giving neighboring countries loans in Yuan and One Belt One Road(OBOR) initiative, finally declared PetroYuan which means Oil could be purchased in Yuan which was supported by Russia, Iran and Saudi.

USA could show their aggression as they did with other countries but as China is super power with Russia’s support so they could not use the old strategy.

**But USA always had innovative way to handle dollar crisis**

&gt;!The innovative solution — Cryptocurrencies (Blockchain Technologies) or Bitcoin!&lt;

In 2008, Bitcoin was invented and in over a decade it died many deaths  but always came out strong. Cryptocurrency are not backed by anything but, only we all collectively believe and accept there is value in it. It’s non-mutable decentralized ledger where all the transactions are recorded and approved by major of the network participant. It’s not centralized like Bank where database can be hacked or brought down. After a decade the technology is now accepted widely and found some serious application in real world. 

    Bitcoin could not scale or live up to expectation to be today's currency as it is pathetically slow, high cost of transaction and nearing 51% problem as most of the miners are from China

**XRP new world Currency?**

Interestingly there’s a cryptocurrency which is decentralised but controlled by private entity and trying to solve real problem i.e sending money between countries seamless , real time, transparent and dirt cheap. It’s replacing SWIFT (The old payment rail for petrodollar). SWIFT was designed 40 years back, with SWIFT system trillions of dollars are stuck with banks doing nothing which will be released once Ripple replaces SWIFT. Already people in Japan and South Korea, Singapore, USA, Australia and UK have started to use XRP as payment method in day today transaction. XRP has the potential to be currency of every denizen of planet earth. Already central banks and monetary authorities tripping over each other to integrate ripple.

Ripple has wholistic solution to be a global liquidity provider and has been making right moves with IMF, World Bank, Central Banks, Authorities and regulators through the world and slowly and steadily it's progress is on course.

XRP is set to become the new world order international currency. At last, money is changing and will change so fast that you will even not realize that every thing change as it happened with photography.

personalfinance,Best way to save an extra $400?,"I have read a lot of posts in this community, the whole sidebar, and I love personal finance, but I didn't find an answer to my question. I will provide context to my situation the best I can, and then hopefully you can point me in the right direction. I will bolden the essential bits.

**I'm (24) not in the US.** I've been working freelance since Jan 2016, and earning an average of $1500 a month, with huge variations month-to-month. I live with my parents, and my only fixed expenses are:

\- Gas (I use a family car)

\- Phone

\- Daily meds

Plus other, irregular expenses, like medical care, clothing, personal care, work supplies, travel. **The accounts I currently hold are a credit card (paid fully every month), regular savings acct, and a checking acct. I have great health insurance that I continued paying when I fell out of my family plan, life insurance, and 2 different retirement funds, all to which I contribute.** Right now, my two retirement funds receive $200, which is what I have felt comfortable contributing, between my good and bad work months. In case it's relevant: both of these funds have similar interest rates at 3%, but one of them is available to me from now, and the other in 10 years or so (but I can take out loans on it if necessary). Between my savings account and my retirement funds, I have saved up around $6K.

I don't plan to have children. I have no short-term engagement or marriage plan, nor do I even know if I want to stay in this country. I am considering moving within the next 5 years to study a master's degree, which I would like to save up for. **I do want to move out within the next two years**, for personal reasons, and do not mind living alone (I'm quite independent).

The new factor: **I just started working full-time, with great pay and benefits. The monthly pay is $1650, less taxes, which ends up being at least $1250.** It's important to note that this job does not interfere with my ability to do my freelance work, which is part of the reason why I took it. I'm expecting to continue covering my few monthly expenses with my freelancing, as I've always done. **My job also covers transportation costs and I've factored meals on the job into the monthly income.** With that said, I've already made some decisions on this new income.

1. I've decided to take $850 of that monthly and immediately deposit it into my retirement funds. This would increase my monthly contribution to 1K.
2. My job includes life and health insurance, so I've decided to renegotiate my current health insurance plan, in order to decrease what I pay monthly. After I decrease it, I will take the monthly difference, and also deposit it into my retirement funds.
3. That leaves me with $400 off my paycheck. I don't want to keep it in my savings/checking accts because I fear that I will spend it. What I would like to do, is to open some sort of account where I can deposit it as if I were paying rent. I would like to do this because I would like to move out of parent's house within two years, and I believe the transition would be easier if I'm already used to paying that money, and if I already have some saved up. Rent in this city (depending on the area) is usually more expensive than that, plus utilities, so I don't intend to fool myself, only to create a good habit. Perhaps if I do well, I can increase my imaginary ""rent"" payment after I get adjusted.

**My questions are: what type of account would be better to save this monthly $400? Is there an even better way to save this money, like to invest it? Any other comments or advice are appreciated.**",finance
financialindependence,"Post-FIRE, how do people using the ACA decide on their income?","* I'm 35, my wife is 32. She just quit her job (I've been FIRE) so we're now living off of investment income.
* We plan to spend up to $40,000 per year in FIRE, though some passive income (for now) means we'll draw less than that from our investments (30k-ish).
* We plan to use the Roth IRA rollover ladder for future expenses.
* Our taxable accounts are substantial (over 400k) so we won't need to pull funds from our Roth IRAs any time soon.

The dilemma I'm having is how much money to rollover from a Traditional IRA to a Roth IRA for income purposes. We live in a state that has not expanded Medicaid. We're a household of 3 so our income needs to be at least $20,420 in 2018 to not be on Medicaid. Our income won't be any higher than $30,629 because this keeps us in the highest Cost Sharing Reduction group.

For every dollar between $20,420 and $27,158 (133% FPL for 3 people) we'll pay a constant 7.5% in tax (state tax &amp; increased insurance premiums, still no Federal tax due to standard deduction and qualified dividends being taxed @ long term capital gains rate of 0%).

From $27,158 (133% FPL) to $28,179 (138% FPL), that $1,021 increase in income will cost us $443 (state tax &amp; insurance premiums, still no Federal tax), an effective tax rate of over 43%.

From $28,179 (138% FPL) to $30,630 (150% FPL), that $2,451 increase in income will cost us $428 (state tax &amp; insurance premiums, just reaching the end of our qualified dividend income so Federal tax is still basically $0), an effective tax rate of 17.5%.

The state tax is a constant 5.5% in this equation. The big driver of cost increases is the rise in the percentage of income we pay for insurance premiums as we move into higher income brackets. What I've been trying to figure out is how I balance what is worth paying in ""tax"" now against what we'll eventually need to withdraw from our Roth IRAs.

This isn't a long-term strategy because no matter what income we choose it may not be enough to fully fund living off of Roth IRA contributions. We'd be rolling over about 20k a year and eventually we'll likely need to withdraw about 30k a year, assuming we spend the full 40k a year we plan for. However, our base spending is only 30k a year so there's room for less elective spending. It's hard to say how soon we'll need to touch our Roth IRAs because of how large our taxable accounts are. It might be almost 20 years before we'll need to touch them, or it could be 8-10 years if we see a big recession. I'm not focused on the future beyond the next couple years too much because there are a lot of things that could change the equation. If we keep our rental, the mortgage will be gone in 10 years so we'll see another 10k a year in income. If we have a child it would raise the threshold for the same FPL levels to an acceptable dollar amount, making this concern moot.

If we choose to declare a higher income, we're locking in that higher tax rate because we're paying it now, whereas something could change in the future where we would pay less tax. The ACA could change or go away. We could move to a state with no income tax, changing what we'd pay in future tax. We've talked about international travel so if we were out of the country for a year that might present a one time low/no tax opportunity to move some money around.

What ""tax rate"" do other FIREd folks use as a threshold where it's worth paying for the income? Do you always try to get as close to zero as possible or do you have a number where you say, anything that keeps me under X% is worth taking now?",finance

I'm ready to aggressively pay off these loans, and would like some advice on the best approach.  I have excellent credit, about 34k in my savings, and on average net about 2k per month after all of my expenses. Should I:
- Knock out my savings just to save the interest and be done with these loans? I do take risks but this seems like a dangerous move despite my ability to replenish in 12-14 MO.
- Chip away ~2-3k / MO over the next year or so, starting with the higher interest loan?  Seems like a safe and simple option.
- Look into private consolidation via Earnest, SoFi, Upstart, etc, to get a lower rate and then chip away 2-3k / MO? Rates are in the 3.5-3.9% range. I realize I would lose the federal benefits with this option, but I'm thinking this is a good balance of minimizing interest payments and keeping my savings intact. I'm leaning towards this option, but I do not have any experience with this type of loan.

personalfinance,Question regarding dropping PMI after reaching 20% equity,"So please feel free to correct me on any of this information I have done some research and read these forums a bit but I’ve also gotten some hearsay advice from friends so I’m looking for clarification. 

I purchased a home using a FHA 203k mortgage putting the minimum down. 330k for the home, 160k for the work to be done. In addition to all the financed funds for the work I will say by the end of it I’ll probably use another 15k our of pocket. Comparable homes in the area 650k-675k. Provided my home gets assessed for the 650k number I will have equity great than 20%.

Here is where my confusion lies, I called my mortgage company and they said regardless of how much equity I have that PMI stay for the life of the loan unless I refinance. The hearsay I got from friends is that new laws were passed that mortgage companies are required to drop the PMI after you reach 20% equity. 

Can anyone clarify which it is? In addition I know rates have risen since I purchased my home in November on the whole does it even make sense to refinance when factoring in, what I assume is, an increase in interest rate and the cost of the refinance.

personalfinance,Non-Traditional Medical Student with a Family Budget Help,"Hi everyone!!

Thanks for your help. I have lurked in this community before, although not as much recently with all the craziness, and I really need help with a budget. My husband and I have never had to truly worry about a budget before. We are both crazy savers and always made enough to not budget down to the dollar. We have always had a biweekly discussion about our finances but if I got two extra coffees one week, it was never a big deal.

This year, my husband found out he has been accepted into medical school! He has always wanted to go and had applied once before out of college, but didn't get in. After getting his Master's and Ph.D., he wanted to try one more time. So, we are obviously supporting his dream!! I'm so proud.

Background: I, the wife am \[30F\] and my husband \[30M\] have two children now. One 2 year old son and one 8 month old daughter. I need help with our budget. I want to make sure I've thought of everything we would need. We are selling our house and moving. Right now, we only have 5k in savings after the move and our A/C / heating unit breaking right before we put it on the market. We got 30k from the sale of our house which we plan on putting just in savings.

Here is the budget I have come up with:

We will be taking out 60k in loans every year for his medical school. The interest rate is 3.05%. After health insurance and taxes, our household income will be 50k a year. I don't plan on putting anything into retirement for the next four years. We already have more than 100k in our retirement accounts and I think that should mostly be fine. We don't have to pay for our cell phones.

Also to note:

My daughter has to have hypoallergenic formula, so that costs $400/month, but will go way down when she is a year old. I thought keeping the formula/diaper line at $500 could also then switch to baby things in general. Maybe skating lessons or swim lessons?

My husband loves cable TV. It is the one thing he does not want to get rid of.  I could easily live without and just use Hulu, but he doesn't want to, so for now I'm keeping it in the budget. It is pretty much his only request for our budget. We are also on a month-to-month, so if it does get too expensive I can easily cancel it.

Finally, we are both vegetarians and buy a lot of produce. We go out to dinner once a week, I get a coffee once a week and my husband eats out lunch once a week. I know our grocery bill is high, but I'm not sure how to reduce the cost. We already buy the bare minimum every week and this is as cheap as I've been able to get it. Anyway, I'm aware that it is a problem and will be working on it. I haven't had to really try to pare it down, due to our past financial situation, but recognize it is an area to work on.

Energy $200

Water $50

personalfinance,I could really use some advice on when or if it makes sense to sell a rental house.,"I could use some advice on when or if it makes sense to sell a rental house. This is a near suburb of Seattle (Renton).

Last summer, my family moved into a new house. The house sold for $680K. The market was/is hot, and we didn't want to do a contingent sale, so we took out a 100K home equity loan. The loan is interest only for 3 years (5.99% - approx $500/month), then converts to a 30 year. In addition, we took a 60k loan (%6.99 - minimum payment is approx $400/month). 

On our new house, the payment is about 3500, but we have a MIL that rents for 1000 (nets out to $2500). The rental's mortgage payment is about 1800, and we rent it for $2300. I'd say we have about $200k in equity in the rental house (based on Zillow/RedFin estimate). Being in the Seattle area, the house prices in the area are going up between 6-10% a year. 

On the expense side, we have student loans (approx $800/month), school tuition ($1300/month), utilities (nets out to about $500-600/month), and life expenses for a family with 3 young kids. We have no outstanding credit card debt, two cars paid for. We do have some health issues in the family that generally costs $300/month. 

On the surface, our outlay for mortgages is $5300, with $3200 offset by rent. I want to allocate $1400 to pay down HELOC and loan (I want to drive those debts down). 

On the income side, my take-home pay is about $8200/month, and I do side work that gets me between $10k and $15k per year (not monthly, it comes in bursts).  On the surface, we have $12k month incoming (wage, extra work, 2 rentals), and minimum of $10k out. That $2k covers food, gas, vacations, car repairs, clothes, etc. It's rather tight, and not a lot of opportunity for saving (aside from 401k contributions at work).

Now for the kicker - the house we bought was built in the 1930s, and while it is livable, there are some serious costs coming down the road. We had to reline the sewer line this winter to the tune of $17k, which wiped out our reserve fund. Sometime in the next few years we're going to need to replace the plumbing (it's all galvanized iron, and past its end of life) for about $15k, and the electric (a mix of knob and tube plus some iffy wiring done by previous owners) for about $30k. Having an almost totally depleted reserve fund stresses me out. We will be able to get it back up over the next few months (it gets rebuilt from annual bonus and extra side work)

The housing market in Seattle has been quite hot for the last few years, but is starting to cool down. What I am trying to figure out is if it makes sense to sell the rental house, and use that money to retire the HELOC ($100k) and the loan ($60k) plus the higher interest student loan (it's about 6%). 

I'm very torn, as the Seattle economy is very healthy, so I expect at least 5% appreciation on the houses, and I expect to get 4%-6% raises over the next few years. But there is risk, as if the house goes unrented, that puts me in the negative per month, not to mention any rental expenses. 

The big question for me, that I'm hoping people here can help with, is how to think about the income and capital appreciation from the rental vs the somewhat high interest rates on the HELOC and Loan. Some of the factors I don't fully understand are the tax implications of the rental (keeping it vs selling, rental house interest vs income, etc.), the long term benefit/disadvantage of keeping the rental and how to think about the opportunity costs of not having the extra cash flow (IRA, 529 for kids, etc.). 

Let me know if I left out any information that would be useful. Any input is very appreciated!",finance

personalfinance,I am eligible for PSLF; should I pay off my loan before the time runs down on forgiveness or save the money?,"Alright, I know there are people screaming at me, ""Pay off the loan, dangit!"" But let me explain. 

I'm 26, I work in a municipal public library and I make about $36,000 a year before taxes. My health care is paid for by my job, and I currently don't have any money saved for retirement because I had to cash out my 401k because I was out of work for nearly four months between the end of last year and the start of this year, and my emergency fund did not go as far as I would have liked it to. I also have two sets of student loans: one loan was serviced directly through my college and currently sits at about $3500. After I build up an emergency fund that might, y'know, actually pay for an emergency, I plan on paying that one off. The other loans is a little bit of a different story though. 

I qualify for Public Service Loan Forgiveness, which means after 120 monthly payments, I get my loans forgiven. I also qualify for income driven repayment, which means I am paying vastly less than what I would normally pay on my loans (the monthly payment amount I was first given was $411, and it's currently at $104 because I quit my job and made way less money last year than expected). So, that means if the PSLF Program Stays in affect I will likely end up repaying about $10k to $15k (depending on how my IBR fluctuates) on a $40k loan amount, and then it will be forgiven. 

I did some math, and at the present time I have about $400 per paycheck that I'm putting in savings to build up an emergency fund. If I were to continue that pattern over the next ten years, I could end up with about $100k in principle alone -- if I invest it, it could be an even greater amount. 

What I worry about, though is the what if scenarios that could become vary real. The current political administration is thinking of undoing the Public Service Forgiveness program, which means that I could end up having to repay the amount in full anyway. If I end up needing to move to a different sector before the ten years is up I will no longer qualify. In the mean time, that $40k is acruing interest (interest rates vary from 3.5% to 6%). On that same spreadsheet where I worked out that I could save about $100k over the next ten years, I also figured out that I could pay off that $40k in late 2022, before I even turn 30. 

I guess what I'm asking is would you take the risk of waiting out the terms of loan forgiveness, or would you just pay off the loan and then build up money to be invested afterwards?

TL;DR: As long as the public loan forgiveness program lasts, I could have a $40k loan forgiven after ten years of minimal payments, while stuffing my savings account. Or I could pay off the loan over the next four years. What would you do?",finance

personalfinance,Should I let my partner pay off my student loans (UK&amp;CAN)?,"All amounts have been converted to CAD$

My fiance and I are getting married in October. After we get married, we want to both aggressively start paying down our respective student loan debt.

Fiance also has about ~$50,000-70,000 in savings from in various accounts that his parents have tucked away for him in the UK (it's intended for a wedding or as a down payment on a house). I have $38,000 in Canadian student loans where he has ~$50,000 in UK student loans.

Since fiance's student loans are British, the interest rate of his loans is quite low (1.5%). He looked into it a year or two ago and realised that he is better off letting his savings accumulate interest while paying back the minimum amount to his loans. His loans are also linked to income, so during periods of unemployment, he doesn't have to pay anything back at all. 

On the other hand, with my Canadian loans (prime + 2.5%), about half of my payments are just going to interest. My payments stay the same as long as I make more than 25K/yr, and during most periods of unemployment, I will still have to make payments.

Our finances are currently set up so half of our pay goes into our joint for joint expenses (food, bills, vehicle &amp; our wedding), and half stays in our personal accounts. For me, a very big chunk of my ""personal"" money goes to loans and tuition for a masters I am currently paying for out of pocket (75%). I have no personal savings, but finance has managed to save an extra $10,000 in the past 8 months without really trying. We are both professionals, although his profession pays better than mine, but with more opportunity for short periods of unemployment (65K versus ~85K). 

In the past few months, fiance has offered to use his savings to pay back all of my loans after we get married. I could then make payments to him instead and not have to worry about interest. This makes me a bit uncomfortable, but I can definitely see the sense in not having to pay the interest. If we do this, I want to make sure he is ""protected"" and that there is assurance that he will get paid back. I am planning on taking out life insurance, but should we also get something in writing drafted up by a lawyer? Are there any tax implications to paying down our loans like this?

Also, for my fiance, would it be better for the money I am paying to him to go into paying back his loans, or into investments for a mortgage in 5 years time when we are ready to buy a house? On a more personal note, I think I might feel guilty if the money I am paying back goes into a ""joint"" item like a house rather than to just benefit my fiance (like paying down student loans).",finance
Ripple,Honest question about Ripple Labs / XRP..,"If XRapid / XCurrent were to become globally adopted, would it makes sense for one company to hold the reigns on inflation/deflation? I understand they have the remaining XRP in escrow, but is that enough? One thing I'd like to propose that may not be very popular, but in all seriousness, should Ripple consider giving custody of it's 55+ billion remaining XRP over to the Federal reserve or a global reserve, or something like this? Are economies and their inflation/deflation really going to be left in the hands of Ripple? I have serious doubts about this authority. I also get that many people don't trust the Fed, but what's more likely for widespread adoption?

From Ripple's site: 

We use Escrow to establish 55 contracts of 1 billion XRP each that will expire on the first day of every month from months 0 to 54. As each contract expires, the XRP will become available for Ripple’s use. You can expect us to continue to use XRP for incentives to market makers who offer tighter spreads for payments and selling XRP to institutional purchasers
We’ll then return whatever is unused at the end of each month to the back of the escrow rotation. For example, if 500M XRP remain unspent at the end of the first month, those 500M XRP will be placed into a new escrow account set to expire in month 55. For comparison, Ripple has sold on average 300M XRP per month for the past 18 months.



This power will be Ripple's for the next 5 years, and who's to say they cant make more than the 100 billion XRP?",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Was taken off autopay without authorization and missed a payment. Question about fixing credit.,"I’ll try to make a long story short  to make it simple.

Back story : Wife and I are both enlisted and she is currently deployed. She bought a car before joining and it has been on auto pay since she purchased it 2 years ago. She called one time after basic to get interest rate lowered to 6% and then once before deployment to see if they offer any perks to deployed members. They said no. She hung up and has been deployed since late April.

Situation: She texted me a week ago saying her credit dropped 81 points 780 to 710. She said her credit karma didn’t say anything about why so she thought it was just a glitch or mess up. She then decided to look at her statements and saw the car hasn’t been taking money out and wanted me to find out what’s up.

I called credit acceptance and told them the situation. They were very wishy washy and going back multiple times about what happened and what payments were missing ect. 

Supposedly she missed Feb, June, July.
Paid March, April 

I asked why and said that she was taken off autopay and I told them she never did that. I asked for records if she was and they say they don’t have any. She doesn’t have an online account with them and the only record they have of her calling was when she asked about the deployment. This is what they said. It didn’t mention anything about autopay.

What I have done : 
I payed all missed payments and set up auto pay, the issue has been brought to their team that reports to credit Bureaus, they don’t have a number and will send mail in 30 days on what they can do.

How can you help:

The main thing we’re worried about is restoring her credit.  She’s never missed a payment on anything in her life and this is devastating to her.
What can we do to fix situation?
Can we call credit bureaus?


Also if you have any questions I will answer them to help clarify.


Thank you for taking time to help me out as this is stressful for her especially with everything on her plate and wanna do anything to relieve any stress she has.",finance
Forex,Underestanding the factors at play in the value of the Lira,"Hello there r/Forex. Just joined this sub as my interest in Forex grows and has been growing for many years now but has never been enough to get me to invest. But given the current events it would be a shame if I didn't look to get some experience out of this. As a final year medical student my knowledge of economics is as extensive as a course on supply and demand curves back in school so let's keep this simple. I guess at this point the questions is weather you pour your money into USD/TRY or the other way around and at this point it seems like it's not very clear which side will be the winner and which the loser. I decided to enumerate the factors that are at play here for and against the Lira:

For

1. Increase in interest rates in Turkey - which if my knowledge of basic economics doesn't fail me, means that foreign investment will pour into Turkish banks in the form of Turkish Lira and thus help keep the value of the currency.

2. Other world powers such as Russia may come in and lend a helping hand to Turkey and keep them afloat.

3. A decrease in the value of the Lira means a country more attractive to tourists and thus a thriving economy with the Lira in circulation.

Against

1. Similarities between Erdogan's rhetoric and others like Chavez who we have seen sink their country into dirt.

2. Doesn't seem like Erdogan will be backing down any time soon and we sure know that backing down isn't in Trump's list of things to do.

3. Erdogan's plea to the Turkish people to sell their USD to keep the Lira afloat - He has a lot to support in Turkey so this might just play a role. 

As I said before this list is by no means complete and I have zero experience in Forex and underestanding how world events influence the value of currencies, so please add and correct anything or everything written and make as much fun of me as you like. I want to improve my learning curve and so I came to you guys directly. It is an honour to me among you.",finance

personalfinance,Student Loan Payoff Pace,"Hi everyone.  I'm currently paying off my student loans aggressively and have managed to pay off about $12,000 of the $30,000 I originally had this year.  Here's where I'm at right now:

Checking account - $5,000 buffer
Monthly Income - $2,200 in biweekly pay, $1,100 rent pay (I rent two rooms in my home to students) = $5,500 monthly
Emergency Fund - $10,080 (not currently adding to this)

Monthly expenses tend to total $3,200 including loan minimum payments, leaving $2,300 for excess payments.

I have a 401K and Roth IRA, but I really don't want to use those for debt payoff.
 
Debt: $2,200 @ 5.35%, $8,300 @ 6.55%, $4,300 @ 4.25%, and $6,900 @ 3.15% (all Federal student loans).

I have about $6,500 in 1-off expenses predicted in the coming year.

My goal is to pay the balance of these loans off completely in the next 12 months.  My minimum payments are approximately $300 per month which, combined with the additional $2,300 I plan to pay per month, makes this possible.  Here are my concerns:

1. I drive an older vehicle (2004 Toyota) that may need to be replaced in a couple of years.  Right now, it's in pretty good physical condition and 2 different mechanics have given the vehicle 3-5 more years of life.  If it does break down, I don't want to finance a car.  Should I reduce my loan payments to save for a car simultaneously?

2.  Should I reduce my checking account buffer to just 1 month of expenses to pay off the loans faster?  That'd net me $1,800 towards the loans right off the bat.

3.  Is there anything else I should be considering or doing in order to kill these loans faster?  I'm pretty much addicted to paying them off at this point, and would appreciate any ideas you've got.

Thanks in advance!

My situation is that I have been offered a job in the private sector as a contractor for the federal government for a gross salary of $115,000, and I am trying to figure out whether or not I should take it.

The private position does include similar benefits but they are simply not as good.  For instance, the insurance plans are a little more expensive, and they match at 4% (not 5%) into a 401K that is not the TSP.  There is also less paid time off, no Flexible Spending Account, no pension in retirement, and obviously it is less secure (much easier to be let go).

If I were to take the private position, my gross salary would immediately jump by $33,452, but due to the nature of my current work (assuming all else remains the same) the increase would only be about $18,000 by the end of 2020.

~200k at around 6.5% interest 
~200-250k at around 7.5% interest
~20k at around 4% interest

These loans are intended to be paid in a 10 year period, though could undoubtedly be refinanced and consolidated for both a longer pay period and lower interest rate. Additionally, they are unsubsidized and thus accrue interest while I am in school.

Additionally, I have considered pursuing orthodontics which would likely run up another 100k in debt.

Median salary for dentists is about 160k and for orthodontists it’s about 200k.

The gist of this is basically I’m experiencing tremendous fear associated with looking down the barrel of this level of debt. Is it even remotely feasible to pay all this back and live a life that is comfortable? Or should I cancel my student loans (I have a brief grace period), leave school, and seek other career paths?

Another factor is that I am enrolled in a top 10 dental school, and I attended a top 20 undergraduate school (no debt from those 4 years). However, my degree was basically a premedical degree, meaning I spent those 4 years only doing courses and activities relevant to attending a dental school, rather than internships, workplace experience etc. 

Even if I leave dental school, I feel I’ve backed myself into a corner where I can either take on 400k+ in debt, or struggle to find a job.

Does this sound like a good plan in your collective opinions? Or should I chase money with a company that offers tuition assistance (of which I think they may cover just my trade school loans, which total about $17,000).

cryptotrading,The main problem of the existing credit system,"In any state of the world there is a hidden monopoly on issuing loans for business and consumer needs. It depends on the quirks of the Central Banks monetary policy, which determine the discount rate, and the greed of local financial institutions that add their margins to this value.

In addition to profits, banks pledge their risks as a percentage of the loan issued, forcing customers to pay for the short-sightedness of the the institution that issued risky, non-recurring loans.

The world of loans is arranged in such a way that a common folks, as well as small and medium-sized business will never be offered favorable borrowing conditions. They are charged with compensating bank losses on long-term loans granted at low interest to large corporations and affiliated entities.

Such ""credit rules"" are supported by the hidden monopoly of the transnational banking system, where there can not be real competition because of the size and political capabilities of industry leaders.

personalfinance,First-time home buyer looking for input on what I can afford,"Hi /r/personalfinance,

I'm looking for some input on how much house I can realistically afford without spreading myself too
thin.

A little background info: I'm a software engineer currently renting an apartment and looking to buy
in the Pittsburgh area.  I've been at my job for a little over 6 years and don't anticipate any
changes for the foreseeable future.

I've been looking at houses priced up to $275k, though preferably lower.  I haven't had as much luck
looking in my current price range, so I'm considering looking at houses up to and possibly over
$300k.  
Depending on taxes/insurance, this would put the monthly housing costs somewhere between
$1,600-$1,900, depending how high I go.

Some numbers:

* Income
  * Gross annual income: ~$88,000
    * Monthly take-home: ~$4,300
    * Putting 14.5% towards 401k, including company match
* Debt
  * Total Debt: ~$22,000
    * Interest rates range from 3.4% to 5.75%
  * Monthly Debt Payments: $622
     * My car payment makes up $183 of this, and will be paid off in February
* Savings
  * $10,000 emergency fund
  * $60,000 for a down payment (more if needed for 20%), with a good amount of savings left over

Am I aiming too high?  Should I stick to my current price range?

personalfinance,What is the easiest way to finance a private party car sale?,"Hello PFers,

I am looking to buy another car soon that will conform to my companies car package policy. I have narrowed down to the type of vehicle I would like and the financing institution I would like to ultimately use. The problem is that in order to get a loan with the local credit union I want to use I have to bring the title of the vehicle into the office in order to get the check. The vehicle I am currently looking at is 2 hours away and it would be tough to convince the seller to let me jet off with the title for half a day. 

I am looking to get financing that will allow me to do the transaction in cash for ease and comfort for the seller, and then immediately refinance with my local credit union. In my research it seems like I would be able to pull this off with lightstream. Cash available same day as approval, No application fees, no pre-payment fees.

I was unaware of this as my father and my aunt had an agreement when she bought my business out that she would pay any remaining fees, taxes, etc. To her knowledge, they have been taken care of.

Backstory on the business: I was coerced into opening a business in the best interest of other people and I stupidly did so when I was 18, making me financially responsible. I left when I got fed up and my father was supposed to take care of everything. He took care of the majority of it, but was left with 3k in taxes that have not been paid. The business closed in October of 2016.

I checked my bank account tonight and I found out that the State of Michigan made a debit of 83.00 from the account on the same day I made a deposit. Because of this, due to a payment that HAD to be made today, I am now overdrawn by 115 dollars and change after the bank made 55 dollar processing fee.

personalfinance,Not making a dent in my student loans after 6 years of payments,"I took out \~120,000 of student loans between 2004-2008 for medical school.  I deferred my loan payments from 2008-2011 while in residency, and finally started paying once I was working (according to my records, I started paying in March 2012).  I had almost $25000 of capitalized interest that added to the principal once I began repayment.  I chose an extended graduated plan so that I could have a low minimum payment but have the option to pay extra and choose where to allocate the extra money.  I have always added at least $100-$200 extra per month to my loan payments.  I've been revamping my loan payoff strategy recently (refinancing and consolidating) and looking back at my history I'm disappointed to see that my current principal balance on all my loans is higher than the original loan balance, despite having paid $50,000 in monthly loan payments over the last 6 years!  I understand the interest capitalization didn't help my situation and it seems that I have paid off about half of the capitalized interest, but I thought I'd have paid off more principal by now.  

Should I be concerned that perhaps my loan payments weren't applied correctly or I was overcharged on interest (my rates vary from 2.125-6.8%, divided pretty evenly at each rate--see below for the breakdown)?  Is this pretty normal for an extended graduated plan to not reduce principal much for the first several years?  As my salary increases I am increasing the amount I put towards student loans, but I'm worried about whether I'll ever pay these off or be ready for retirement.  I don't have a lot of extra money given the high cost of living where I am, so I don't have the luxury of accelerating my payments too much.  What else can I do to start making progress on these loans?  I have refinanced my 6.8% down to 3.549% and I reconsolidated some of my other loans which lowered my rate by 0.25% with autopay.  I believe I will start to see good progress with the lower interest rate, but is there anything else I should be doing?

personalfinance,How am I doing? - $66.5K Salary and $89K Student Loans,"Howdy /personalfinance!

I can’t say how grateful I am to all of the contributors of this sub. The content here is the main reason why I am no longer anxious about my finances and feel like I’m finally in control.

I was recently connected with a financial advisor who talked with me about where I currently am financially, what my short term and long term goals/desires are, and what I can do now to better help me achieve them. He brought up cash value life insurance and beginning to contribute to a mutual fund (both of which I am not super interested in), but perhaps the most beneficial thing that came from this meeting was simply talking through everything. This discussion was what really encouraged me to create this post. Apologies if I should actually be in /investing or /financialfreedom with my main concerns.


**Who am I?**

• I am a 24 year old male with a $66,500 salary (this should increase over the next year due to passing professional exams). After all of my current expenses, I have an extra $350-400 I can allocate elsewhere. I have been dating someone for the past 1.5 years and we intend to get engaged in the next 2 years.


**Assets**

• I have $18,000 in my checking/savings account (of this $15,000 of this is my emergency fund which would cover 6 months of expenses).

• I have $1100 in an Acorns account so that I can passively invest.

• I own a very reliable car (no payments) and don’t foresee myself trading it in for another year or two.


**Debt**

• I have $88,500 in student loan debt. $32,500 has interest rates around 4-5% while $56,000 has interest rates around 6-7%. The minimum payment for all of these loans is around $1000 per month, but I’m currently paying around $1540.

• I have no credit card debt ($10,000 line of credit).


**Current habits**

• I have been contributing 4% to my 401K (Roth) since my first paycheck as my employer also matches every dollar up to that point (4% match).

• I have recently begun to pay above the minimum payments on some of my student loans, more specifically the loans with the highest interest rates.

• I have a fairly small term life insurance policy.


**In summary...**

I’ve built up an emergency fund, have a budget that I am okay at following, contribute to my 401k religiously, and am beginning to make overpayments on my student loans that have the highest interest rates. I guess my main questions are:

• Where should my emergency fund be? It’s currently just in a savings account at US Bank, but I’ve read that I could put it in either staggered CDs or a high interest savings account like Ally Bank (1.8% APY).

• What should I be doing with that extra $350-400 per month? Should this be going towards my student loans, should I be contributing more to my 401k, or is there something else that I’m unaware of?

• Is there anything mentioned above (or not mentioned above) that stands out or that I could improve upon?

Edit: Formatting

Edit #2: Thank you everyone for all of the advice so far. The loan with a 7% interest rate has a payoff balance of about $14,000 so I could use my emergency fund to completely pay that off. The rest of the loans from that provider have 6% interest rates. I would then still have $5500 which would be about two months expenses. Several suggested getting a part-time job, but I study 3 hours a day Monday - Friday after my full-time job and 4+ hours each day Saturday - Sunday (even more once the exam gets closer). I will revisit my budget to see if I can't cut back on anything further.",finance
personalfinance,Credit card debt,"Hi all. I hit a rough patch financially when I had some health problems and couldn’t work. I racked up about $7000 in credit card debt. I have since stopped using them and am trying to chip away at it. Is there a good lending company to use to pay off then debt and get a lowered money payment? Thank you. 

Edit (update): I had about $6,600 in credit card debt so I took out a small personal loan from my credit union for $6,000 at an interest rate over 14% lower than my credit cards. I then paid off the cards with the loan, the rewards points, and some money I had left. I now make a very affordable payment on the loan and will often pay more so I can pay it off early. I feel much more secure now.",finance
personalfinance,Starting From Below $0,"Hi Reddit,

I am starting with $0 to my name after having recently graduated from a Master’s program. All of my savings have gone toward living expenses during grad school, and I am left with $90k in debt from tuition expenses. Next week, I am beginning a job in which I will be making approximately $68k~$78k per year after taxes (my income will increase every 3 months). Most of my income is tax-free as I am a displaced worker. 

Debt: My $90k student loans are all federal with an average weighted interest rate of about 6.2%. I have a car that I'm financing with $3,500 remaining on a 2.99% APR.

Current monthly take home after taxes: $5,680

Student loan repayment: $3,000

Car repayment: $138

Monthly payment to my parents for phone, health insurance, and car insurance: $500 

Food: $400

Current rent/utilities (this may vary greatly throughout year): $433

Other (gas, gym, professional licensing fees, toiletries): About $225

Total: ~$4,700

This will leave just under $1,000, which I have no clear understanding of what to do with. My questions are:

* Because I am starting from nothing, should I place it all in emergency savings? 

* My employer will match up to 6% of a 401(k) for now – how much is reasonable to contribute?

* Is more than 50% of your income a reasonable amount to shuttle toward loans?

I am just starting out, and this is my first job paying over $30k annually so it’s going to be a huge change for me.

personalfinance,How can I improve my student loan situation? (international on H1B),"I’m an Indian citizen (27), currently working in the US on a H1B VISA. Here’s some context on my personal money situation: I make $110,000 a year and live in San Francisco. I’ve managed to bring my rent + personal expenses down to ~2k pm. Outside of that, I need to support my parents (~ $700 pm) and have been paying $1000 pm towards my student loan for the past 2 years. 

About the loan: I took out a loan of 70k from a bank in India to fund my masters program at a really good university in the US (graduated 3 years ago). Now here’s the part that stings: My interest rate is about 12% on the loan and I’ve barely been able to make a dent in it. My remaining amount is about 62k. I applied to refinance this loan with SoFi but was denied with the reason that they don’t refinance loans from institutions abroad. 

I’ve saved up about 12k, have no credit card debt, no 401k(as my employer doesn’t match). The past couple years have been tumultuous for me esp. with dealing with immigration and I didn’t focus enough on saving etc. I’m planning to take a short break soon and look for a much better job + pay(I know I could be making a lot more).

* What options do I have wrt getting a lower interest rate on this loan?
* Should I worry about savings/investment before getting this loan out of the way?
* Any other financial advice you’d give me specific to being on a H1B?",finance

personalfinance,(UK) Manager wants to deduct wages for joint error. Is there anything I can do about this?,"I am currently a University student, and over the summer I have been working at a restaurant. At the very start of my time, the manager and myself waited on a table. Neither of us added two bottles of £40 wine to the table's account, and as a result the table ended up not being charged £80. 

Now that I have left the job, she has sent me a text asking whether it is ok for her to deduct this from my wages. 

While I accept that I have some responsibility for this, it seems unfair that I should shoulder the whole blame, as she was also involved in the table. I also believe that the error came as a result of her management, as only myself and her were working at the time, and as a result we were unbelievably understaffed. Is there anyway I can contest this deduction, or am I stuffed? 

EDIT: after listening to your guys advice, I told her that I did not consent to a deduction, and that I'd be happy to take the issue up with head office if she saw fit. She has replied, promising me that she will not deduct. 

UPDATE NO.2: I have just contacted HR, telling them that she asked to deduct £80 from my wages. I also commented that I believed that this reflected her overall management strategy, which has been poor during my period working with the company.

If I go Traditional, I technically made $5500 less, so I should get $5500 * (12% federal + 5% state) = $935 back from the government during tax returns.

What percentage of your pre-retirement salary would be replaced by the  mandatory part of your retirement income? If we assume a regular  employee who works a 30 year career, somewhere between 55% and 60% or  pre-retirement income would be replaced by these two sources. What  percentage of your pre-retirement salary would a financial planner  recommend you replace? 80%. With just FERS and Social Security, you are  not going to get anywhere near the recommended replacement rate. You  need your TSP!

Today we would take a look at the EUR/USD currency pair. As of the middle of last week the pair began a more pronounced decline and is now down to levels previously reached in April 2017.

As we have mentioned before, there are no serious incentives for the euro to strengthen. The European Central Bank is committed to a soft monetary policy and the economic fundamentals from the eurozone for now remain lukewarm. Right now the single currency is additionally under pressure due to the brewing financial crisis in Turkey. While Turkey is not a part of the European Union, nor the eurozone, there are many European banks operating there who can suffer and transfer damages into the EU. Currently the Turkish lira has sunk by more than 30% for 2018 and inflation in the country is above 15%. Moreover, today we expect the German and eurozone GDP for the second quarter of 2018.

personalfinance,Should I lock in a 6.8% return by cashing out my IRAs?,"I have about $10,000 in my Traditional IRA and Roth IRA combined. I'm starting law school, for which I'll be taking out federal student loans at a 6.8% interest rate. My total student loan debt at the end of my three years of law school is likely to be around $90,000. 

On the one hand, I know I can never get that tax-advantaged space back. On the other hand, I know that guaranteeing a 6.8% return on that money today is a wildly good deal. I know you guys aren't betting people, but I kind of am, and I will eat my hat if the markets return 6.8% annualized over the next three years. My money-earning years are ahead of me as I see it, and that $10,000 probably isn't going to be what makes or breaks my retirement. 

One complicating factor is that this money is all sort of intermingled. The Traditional IRA has Traditional IRA contributions and rollover money from a company 401k, which has both my contributions and employer contributions. The Roth IRA has my Roth IRA contributions and rollover money from a company Roth 401k. So I don't know if untangling that mess is some huge problem either.",finance
personalfinance,Student loan question for a rising college freshman,"Hi guys, I’m a rising college freshman in US.

My family and I recently have came to US early this year, so I’m still learning quite a lot of stuff; so sorry in case I sound so ignorant.

After grants and scholarship, I need to cover about $20,000 for this school year. 

I can get up to $5500 as federal sub+unsubsidized loan that has good interest plan, but I would still need about $14,500.

Do I cover up this amount using private loan like Wells Fargo or something? Is that how most people do get their student loans?

I’m trying to minimize student loans, but I’m willing to borrow if I need it as a form of investment in myself, as I plan to be a physician eventually and I should be able to pay off the loans in future.

Also, I’d greatly appreciate any financial advices. Thanks!",finance
personalfinance,Graduate student looking to refinance undergraduate loans,"In undergraduate, I took out more than $50k through private lenders to cover costs. The rates on these vary but are all pretty bad (9-12%). The majority of these loans have a cosigner, but not all of them. My cosigner basically told me to refinance in order to lower interest rates and to remove some of his credit burden. 

I was led to believe that my stipend would be enough of a salary for lenders to consider refinancing my loans. I'm not sure if my salary is the problem (I will be making ~$25000 without my fellowship offer included) or my high amount of debt. I have very small debt outside of student loans. 

I've done the soft credit pull for lots of major refinancing lenders (earnest, laurel, sofi). However, a lot of these institutions want people who are fully done with school. I want to avoid wracking up more interested than necessary as I intend to defer payment until after graduate school. Are there options I'm not considering that I should be?

tldr/ I want to refinance at least $17k of this debt (however, it would be great if I could refinance more of it). Are there lenders I should be looking at that I haven't considered yet? Are any refinancing lenders going to allow me to defer payments until I graduate?",finance
personalfinance,Would NYC be affordable?,"My gf really has her heart set on moving to New York City next year, and I've been trying to figure out how financially feasible that would be.

After a little research, it seems like we could find an apartment for $1800/month. If we both made about $50,000/yr, that would be about $72,000/yr after taxes between the two of us, which would be just enough to rent an apartment on 30% of our income.

personalfinance,The impacts of a credit reduction?,"Hello! Here are the important facts:

I'm a 40 yo. man that has been employed with the same company for 10 years.  
I don't have a history of debt problems and my credit score has been good for a long time.

BUT NOW...

* I have about $50k in various credit and loan debt. 
* My credit score took a dip in the last year
* I've been working my score back up (Currently **659** TU and **619** EqFx) 
* BUT Last week my primary bank knocked my credit limit back from 13k to 8k, of which I am almost maxed out.

*I'm assuming that my reduction in credit limit is going adversely impact my credit score. Would that be correct?*

So, I've been working on increasing my credit scores, in service of my plan to take a 50k loan to consolidate my debt next month.

So my primary question is:   
**Should I pull the trigger ASAP and take the loan this week BEFORE the reduction in my credit limit has a chance to effect my credit score and thus my ability to get the loan or the interest rate on said loan?** 

Or will that reduction not changes things that much and I should just stick to my original plan and get the benefit of paying my overall debt down by about $1500, over the next month, within the time before I was going to request the 50k loan?

personalfinance,"Didn't have collision insurance, now I'm colliding with the aftermath of an accident. Need advice on moving forward.","Hi r/financialadvice. I could use some knowledge.

So I got in a car accident the other day. I had a sprained neck but my insurance is paying the urgent care bill for that. I didn't have collision insurance so they wont pay for my car however. I've already got people who want to buy my old car off of me as I've decided not to salvage it. I don't know what I have to do in order to make that happen though. I originally intended this to be short and concise but I guess the genie's out of the bottle and this looks to be a long one. Settle in guys and thank you.

Here's the good stuff. 

I'm ok. Could've been much worse.

I've got a solid job for now. I bring home roughly $700 a week with overtime.

My income will be increasing from 18.25/hour to 30.40/hour when the VA gets off their lazy asses and applies my GI bill to my union apprenticeship. I'm still waiting on the paperwork for that.

The car was paid off. 

I've got a newer car that I like so I'm not completely fucked. My parents were able to help me with $3k for a deductible on a 2015 Ford fiesta ST. 53k miles for $11,995. 7.7% interest rate, 5 year loan, $200/month which is pretty solid considering my mediocre credit.

Even if I do get laid off, my job is pretty in demand and I'm willing to travel in order to work.

I've got a great girlfriend that I fully intend on proposing to, when my finances are in order. We've been together nearly 6 years and she's stuck by me despite mistakes I've made and a deployment overseas I went on. She's the catch of a lifetime,  believe me. 

Dudes already want to buy my car. I had a 2007 mazdaspeed 3. They're fairly rare and parts are getting harder to come by. There's at least one guy willing to pay me a bit more than the insurance payout would've been. I haven't told him that I didn't have collision insurance so there won't be a payout. Because of that I have no idea how much to ask this guy for.

I'm getting new insurance WITH COLLISION THIS TIME. And because I'm shopping more smartly I'll be paying roughly the same that I was with my old car, even with the accident and ticket that came with it.

Girlfriend and I are starting a pretty aggressive budgeting process because we eat out and buy shit we don't need too damn much. Im the worst between us. I can go into more detail on the budget if you guys want.

Here's the bad stuff:

My credit isn't great. 608 and 620 are my scores. 

I've got 2 charged up credit cards totaling roughly $1k. 

I've got $16kish in student loans

I've got roughly $10k in a car loan.

My mandatory monthly expenses (rent, utilities, gas) are roughly $1200. That's including the car payment and the new insurance. 

I work 6 10 hour shifts. That leaves only Sunday open to get things accomplished because most places are closed by the time I get home.

I have no fucking clue the process I'd need to go through  in order to sell my car to this dude. 

I don't know if my car needs a salvage title now or if it's still good on the one it has.

I don't know how much my car is worth. I haven't been able to see it since the accident because they close before I get off of work. 

I don't know how to figure out how much it's worth without having an insurance adjuster do that for me.

My parents expect me to pay back the 3k deductible soon. Not immediately, but soon. In monthly payments.

I'm terrified to take a day off and deal with this because they've been having a series of layoffs and it's always the dudes who miss days. And also, missing 10 hours means losing roughly $120 after taxes.

Speaking of taxes, I haven't been able to file my taxes for the past two years because I've been either super broke and super busy or deployed overseas.

This job is only likely to last another 3 or so weeks. I'm a union millwright apprentice so I'm not employed by the company. If I can't find work for a bit after this job ends then I'm screwed.

I need to propose to my gf soon. We talked about it seriously when I got this job and I gave her a rough timeline to expect it and I can tell she's getting impatient. I want to budget between 1100 and 1500 for a ring within the next 3 or so months. Doable, but not necessarily easy.


My plan right now. Feedback is more than welcome.

Sell car to the someone who is offering about what insurance would pay. Probably in the 2.5k range. 

Use 1k to pay off credit cards and put them away for a while.

Use remainder to pay down balance with parents.

File taxes the following paycheck. I have no idea how much this will cost.

Budget aggressively and use a spreadsheet that I design to keep track of that budget. 

That seem idiotic? I'm trying to keep everything in perspective, but it's hard.

I know I should've searched the archives here on this sub and dug around hardcore online, but honestly I'm worried about looking up the wrong shit and I'd rather have someone who knows what they're talking about tell me what to do.

personalfinance,Owner Will Carry Finance- Please help!,"My husband and I are both military veterans and just recently moved from Oregon to Florida. My husband’s entitlement is on a home we own in Oregon and with my entitlement we were able to buy our new house in Florida. We currently have renters in our Oregon home and have a property management company running the show for us. Our neighbors in Oregon wanted to buy our home but after running the numbers they only could afford to do so if they “assumed” our VA loan and the 3.3% interest rate that came with it. We have been working with USAA (serviced by Nationstar) with the assumption since last July. Our buyer was denied because of a DTI that was falsely too high. After sending in the paperwork to correct everything, we are currently waiting on the answer to the appeal.

Our buyers suggested doing an OWC situation if the bank doesn’t come through. At this point I don’t feel like they are competent enough to work this through for us but I have seen the buyers credit scores, income, and credit reports and know they are worthy buyers, the bank just sucks and is incompetent honestly. Don’t use USAA this isn’t the first problem we have had with them. 

I guess my question put simply is what are the considerations to an owner will carry situation? We would initially take the lump sum of money between the purchase price and the current mortgage (429,000 sale price and current loan balance of 383,000) and have them take over payments for our loan. I am only willing to do this for so long however. The thought is he will get renters in his house which will offset his mortgage or even sell his home because he sees the value in acquiring ours at such a low interest rate and it really is a great opportunity. Within the agreed upon time span this buyer will need to do everything to get the assumption to work. I acknowledge however that him getting traditional financing in 5 years isn’t a possibility if he can’t necessarily afford it now but I’m looking down the line and trying to anticipate if we go this route and the assumption never happens, how do I move forward being bank for 22 more years? To start I would raise the interest rate. 

Most OWC scenarios I researched online tend to include a balloon payment in 5 or 10 years. In my case if we can’t get the assumption to go through within 5 years I would need to adjust the terms to favor me moving forward while still playing bank. I can ask that he get other financing but I don’t think this will be a possibility, especially if interest rates tend to rise and I want a back up plan that won’t blow up in either of our faces.

personalfinance,Home Financing Advice?,"I'm a 29M in quite the dog-shit of a situation currently and could use some advice. I recently was evicted (long story involving friend owning house and white-knighting surrounding it). I now find myself, and my family at my mom's temporarily while searching for a house. She recently bought a new house 4 hours away and would like to have her house sold by the end of September. Father isn't in the picture.

I make decent money (32,000) but last year had my first baby and my fiance isn't working because her wages vs paying a babysitter ended up coming out flush. So needless to say this last year the debt has kind of built up a bit, but has recently came to a stop on the building aspect.  I have great credit (mid 700's) but my debt to income is pretty high....I only have about 800 a month to work with for a living situation. I live in a rural area where the average rent is around 800 a month, no utilities. In two years my car and personal loan will be paid off but in the meantime I am not appealing to local banks or quicken loans.

I have someone who is willing to do the financing for me on a house and do contract for deed from there, which helps immensely. But after finding out about compounded interest through banks and how much you end up paying over the life of a house loan, it just seems depressing and potentially problematic. In a few years this wont be an issue but right now needing a home for my family and not wanting to put them somewhere sketchy in meth-county has me stressed.

My main question is are there alternatives to home loans where the interest rate isn't going to kill my monthly payment or any other options that may help this situation. I have no money in savings or a down payment, and anything in my price range isn't going to pass for an FHA loan. I just feel really stuck and unknowing in this whole scenario. My mom (unbelievably graciously) did also say that once her house sells she would give me 3000 to help with the home process. I've never really asked her for anything being a single mom so it came out of left field and I want to use it responsibly and not waste it on a potential bankruptcy and destroy everything I worked hard to build up these last 14 years.

The 2nd source is from the sale of some real estate.  The amount is not guaranteed (because it hasn't sold yet), but may be up to $80,000 (just for me).  

I have read the lawyer's paperwork and don't understand how the estate tax will work being that I am inheriting a portion of the total inheritance (total was upwards of $10 million).  

Other than taxes, I am looking at what I can do with the money.  I am a fairly risk averse person, so investing in the stock market scares the crap out of me.  My job deposits money into my 401k (4% I think), they do not do matching.

I work full time, but do not necessarily make a lot of money.  I do not own a home.  Even if I used all of the money for a down payment, the cost of the mortgage+insurance+tax would be more than I can afford based on where I would want to live (ie: not a bad area, not ridiculously far from work).  I could potentially afford to buy a condo.

* *Gas - $400 (company paid after 5 years)*
* *Entertainment, misc, etc - $400 ( we are fairly frugal)*

Leftover = $630 (save half, loans other half?)

With this, loans should be done in about

How are we looking currently and future plans (aside from truck payment please)? I would like to move some of this current extra money into IRAs or something else for both of us, but not sure if it is the best option.

Savings account is planned to stay untouched and kept for a starting E-fund when we graduate, to throw all extra money at debts. My company has fully paid pension as well, fully vested after 7 years.

This should have all our debts paid off in less than 8 years which we are okay with considering salary increases + bonuses will be giving us extra money every couple of years until then.

We don't plan on buying a house anytime soon as we both want to travel for work (housing will get paid for due to moving for work + per diem, so that may free up an extra $1k/mo) I calculated everything as if we were paying for housing and no additional per diem, though.

Raises and bonuses are common in my career, within 5 years I should be making around $80k myself without bonuses. The company starts pay a little lower on purpose.

**\*Truck info** \-  am paying $400/mo and will increase when I graduate, I know 72 mos is idiotic, I took it to have the option of lower payments, but the total interest difference was less than $1k at 48 vs 72, so worst case I am out an extra $1k over a few years and I can live with that.

I saved for a couple of years to use as a down payment when graduating. My old truck just died, I got a cheaper one than I was planning on to not use a down payment, and am using that money for monthly payments until graduating. I know this is a bad idea, but I went over all the worst case scenarios and we will be 100% okay (both parents are able to help as needed and currently pay for misc expenses, phones, insurance, etc.)

If you want to tear me a new one for the truck - go ahead (I expect it), but I'd like some input on future plans atleast hahah",finance

Bitcoin,How MtGox could start WWIII,"It is widely thought that Alexander Vinnick holds the keys to some of the stolen 600,000 MtGox bitcoins. Vinnick is awaiting extradition to one of three nations-- France Russia and the US. There is tremendous pressure from Russia to extradite him for a flimsy old $9400 fraud charge. The Russians, of course, are drooling over the possibility of extracting from Vinnick the keys  to the stolen $3.5 billion MtGox coins in exchange for leniency.

How could this spiral into war? 

1. Russian oligarchs gain possession of the 600,000 bitcoins belonging to MtGox creditors.

2. US and other western nations file claims under international law for return of recovered stolen assets.

3. Russians refuse claim.

4. US Federal court orders $3.5 billion in Russian held US Treasuries seized for distribution to MtGox creditors.

5. Russia seizes $3 billion in US assets held in Russia.

6. US threatens isolation of Russia from the banking system.

6. In the past Russia has threatened to use nuclear weapons if its Visa/Mastercard payment network was disconnected from the world banking system. They reiterate the threat.

7. President Trump threatens a pre-emptive nuclear strike if any nation uses threats of nuclear war  to gain economic or financial leverage in deplomacy.

8. US orders Visa/Mastercard out of Russia.

9. All 11 Russian ballistic missile submarines, mistakenly thought to be invisible to the US Navy, are simultaneously destroyed.",cryptocurrency

financialindependence,Useful Updates to Personal Capital Planning Tools,"First time poster here, hoping to share some potential good news with the community that has given me so much guidance and direction (as I lurked in the shadows).

I just received an email from Personal Capital today highlighting the ""Significant Improvements to Your Retirement Planner"". Here is the link to the video describing the changes (https://vimeo.com/281519928) and I've posted the email text at the bottom of the post.

Previously, I was underwhelmed with the lack of variables available when creating your retirement plan and ended up turning to the numerous other tools out there (FIREcalc, cFIREsim, i-ORP) for crafting my plan. It looks like they've taken notice of those tools and incorporated a lot of the functionality. I haven't had the chance to give it a test drive, but hopefully this will help me stop bouncing around between tools as I develop and track my plan.

 ""We’re excited to let you know about a series of improvements we’ve recently made to our Retirement Planner tool. Our goal is to constantly improve the sophistication of our tools to ensure you have the most up-to-date, precise, and holistic view of your financial life. The new improvements include:

* You can now view the breakdown and growth of your portfolio by asset location: Taxable, Tax-Deferred, Tax-Free, and Education
* During retirement, your cash flows are now personalized to your specific circumstances based on your tax filing status, state, and annual income events
* Retirement spending assumes a decrease of 1% per year, in line with what we have observed for most retirees
* Adjustment to return assumptions to reflect the impact of current interest rates, investor behavior and transaction costs
* Lower inflation estimates to reflect current market conditions
* Option to enter income events as before or after taxes
* Ability to toggle inflation assumptions for certain income cash flows such as annuities or pensions, which typically do not come with a cost of living adjustment
* When spouses retire in different years, we will consider full retirement to be the year when both spouses are retired. During the period when only one spouse is retired, savings will be adjusted downward by the retired spouse’s salary.""",finance

personalfinance,"Near 100% debt-income ratio, no viable solution in sight for debt management.","I have been struggling to find the solution to this for a few years now. I feel as though I have exhausted all my resources and explored all viable options. Please refrain from the “should have’s.” I’m not interested in what I should have done. I am interested in what I should do. The 3 tables below outline my situation. Obviously some things should be considered and weighted so I have included the important factors in the following list. 

Important notes

- 25 years young, M.S. in Aerospace Engineering, awesome job, great pay, 3 yrs private industry experience, 1yr internship at NASA
- Active security clearance. Meaning I am at risk of losing my job if I lose my clearance due to financial issues. 
- 2 Adults, 2 kids. (Yes 2 kids, first planned, second not so much)
- Live in Los Angeles (1 hour commute to work to have secured affordable rental housing)
- 1 income
- 1 car
- Not credit worthy for refinancing. 13 negative marks on credit history (60 day late). Missed my first two fed payments after school which were 13 loans.
- Preschool/Daycare costs more than what other working adult can make including the additional costs of another vehicle or even public transportation
- Wife and I come from poverty level families so family aid is way off the table
- Grandfather (Cosigner for private loans) has warned me he is done with the surgeries and pain. DNR signed for next event. Contractual auto-default contingency places me at risk for being responsible to fully repay loan ($50,000) within 1 weeks’ notice. Thankfully CA is taking these sharks to federal court over this but nothing secured and no protections.  
- Overtime is basically a necessity to cover the additional unlisted expenses. 
- No assets.

What have I done so far?
- Made every attempt to place extra overtime cash into debts. The unexpected needs seem to offset me every instance with some exceptions I can make slow headway
- Consulted my employer. I received a (22%) raise 6 months ago when presenting the issue. 
- Now paid 10% above my market value, however, the gains are offset by IDR plans which suck up the difference
- Selling our possessions. Didn't take long to realize our most expensive possession is probably our phones. 
- Second job for my technical skills paid $22.50/hr for tutoring but ended up as 1099 (no thanks I already owe taxes)
- Other adult night job. Seems impossible considering this is the full-time ""day care"" parent
- Learned that I would have more disposable income if I were to drop below the poverty line than if I were to gain income (because IDR plans yay)

personalfinance,Living above our means and can't get ahead.,"Using a throwaway for anonymity.

Hi, all. As the title suggests, my husband and I are not good with money. We live above our means and now we are lying in our proverbial bed. We have no savings and had to take out a loan from my husband's 401k to pay attorney fees (custody). Our expenses are as follows (I apologize, I don't know the interest rates of our debts):

**Husband's monthly net income: $2,600**

**My monthly net income: $1,600**

Rent: $1,160/month including water

Car 1: $475/month (48 months left/64 months)

Car 2: $350/month (50 months left/64 months)

Car insurance: $220/month

Gas: $200/month

Childcare: $300/month

Groceries $350/month

Energy: $180/month

Cell phones: $220/month

Internet: $100/month

Student loans: $50/month ($36k total)

IRS: $150/month

Homeowner's insurance: $30/month

Hulu: $12/month

Attorney $600 invoice

We don't have credit cards, never have. Based on my math, we should be saving at least a couple hundred dollars each month, but we are living nearly paycheck-to-paycheck. It feels like we will never get ahead. I reviewed our bank statements to understand where our money is going so I know where to cut back, but I just can't find a common denominator. No transfers, no cash withdrawals. We don't go out to eat, nor do we spend our money on funsies or entertainment. However, I have noticed that we don't stick to a tight grocery budget. That will be my first step.

**tl;dr:** Our living expenses are too great for our income. What can we do to save money and pay down our debts? Thank you.",finance

CryptoCurrency,Bitconnect fraud: How investors lost USD 3.14 billions,"AHMEDABAD: It was too good a deal — earn 1% daily interest and double your money in 100 days. Too good to be true, hordes of rich investors in 

Gujarat

realised a year later when the BitConnect platform folded up after pocketing roughly Rs 22,000 crore of their money in Bitcoin. For many, it was a double whammy after the jolt of demonetisation. In fact, the 

Bitcoin

craze had started in the state as people looked for safe ways to launder their piles of black money after November 2016.


“The transactions were anonymous, it did not require any proof and, best of all, it could be operated from anywhere in the world. A cryptocurrency boom started overnight,” Sunny Vaghela, CTO of an Ahmedabad-based IT firm, told TOI. Surat became the trade’s hub with numerous ‘equity brokers’, who juggled different cryptocurrencies for maximum profit. Bloomberg also reported that most Google searches for laundering money in that period were made from Gujarat, and Indians were willing to pay up to 25% more for Bitcoin.

Throughout 2017, Bitcoin gained value like nothing else. The price of one Bitcoin shot up from $900 to $20,000. It became a must-have asset. If you were greedy, you had to be invested in it. While demand alone was driving up Bitcoin’s price, along came an offer that made holding it even more lucrative. BitConnect, a similar sounding but unrelated cryptocurrency platform, offered to pay 1% daily interest to Bitcoin owners, and more if they got other owners on board.


Investors loaned their Bitcoin to BitConnect, which issued them its own token currency called BCC, and made all principal and interest payments in BCC as well. It was a classic Ponzi scheme, and the fact that they were signing away their precious Bitcoin should have alarmed investors. Many experts had been calling Bit-Connect a scam from the beginning, but with the returns so high, investors kept their eyes tightly shut.

BitConnect’s scheme was simple. It had a fixed number of BCC ‘coins’. Their value increased with demand. Its sky-high interest rate kept pushing up demand, so the price went on rising until the securities boards of 

Texas

 and North Carolina ordered it to stop dealing in January. “The investors got happy with notional gains. The coins, bought at $50-100, became worth $362 in a year,” said an investigator working on the case.


But when the bubble burst on January 16 this year, BCC crashed to $2 overnight, and now it trades below half a dollar. BitConnect promptly repaid investors in practically worthless BCC, and walked away with their Bitcoin. Altogether, BitConnect may have siphoned off more money than 

Nirav Modi

, but police have not received many complaints, possibly because many of the investors used black money to buy Bitcoin. “So far, we have received complaints for cheating worth Rs 1.14 crore,” said Ashish Bhatia, DGP, CID (crime).

But some influential investors have tried squeezing out their money in unlawful ways. In March, Surat realtor Shailesh Bhatt complained that he was abducted by some policemen and made to transfer 176 Bitcoins from his digital wallet. About a dozen cops were arrested in connection with the conspiracy till July, and the name of former BJP MLA Nalin Kotadiya also cropped up in the investigation.

Later, it was alleged that Bhatt himself had abducted a BitConnect promoter, Dhaval Mavani, and his employee Piyush Savaliya, to extort 2,256 Bitcoins. One of Bhatt’s alleged partners in crime, Kirit Paladiya, then doublecrossed him to get more than his fair share of the cryptocurrency ransom.

personalfinance,"Got in a car accident a few months back, no police report was filed, collections is now coming at me for damage cost","I’m not sure if this is the right sub to post so if not please let me know. 

A few months ago in 2017 I was in a small car accident in a Target parking lot. It was a small fender bender involving another lady that caused minor damage to her vehicle and the most damage to mine. The only damage to her car was the front fender popped off, mine in the other hand had giant hole in the front fender, a busted light, and damage to the door. Nothing major but more damage than hers. 

I am fairly young (20 at the time of the accident) and this was my first auto accident. I was shaken and had no idea what to do. I didn’t see her car and according to her she didn’t see me either. She seemed nice enough at first. I told her I had never had anything like this happened so I didn’t know what to do. I suggested calling the police because that’s what i’ve been told to do by my parents, but immediately after I suggested it she cut me off “no don’t they won’t be able to do anything to help us.” When I asked why not she said “this is private property so it’s out of their jurisdiction. we might as well handle it with our insurance.” and so i asked if she was sure she didn’t want to call the police and she said “seriously trust me I used to work in car insurance.” So I trusted her and asked what I should do. She said call my insurance. I asked if she needed to call hers too and she said no. So I called mine and talked to the guy. He took my information then asked to speak to her. I gave her the phone and she kind of walked away while she talked to him but I could still hear her. She was telling him her info and that I was at fault. She gave the phone back to me and he was asking me what happened and I told him, he asked if I was at fault and I said I don’t know maybe. it happened so fast I wasn’t sure and took her word for it because it seemed like she knew what she was doing. Afterwards the lady came up to me and said said “I know this is scary but you know it’s your fault right?” she sounded almost motherly and like she felt bad for me. I said okay and we went our separate ways. Now i’m starting to think she took advantage of me because I was shaken and scared at the time. 

So a few months pass by after the accident and I didn’t hear anything from insurance. I called but they couldn’t find my claim, I assumed she called and dropped it or something (i don’t know how all of that stuff works so i was only assuming) I ended up fixing my car out of pocket because it worked out cheaper for me that way and after that i thought the entire ordeal was over. Well recently I end up getting a letter in the mail from a collection agency stating that I owe $3,675.00 to what I’m presuming is her insurance company for damages related to the accident. It states that if I don’t pay they will report this to the department of motor vehicles and could possibly have my license suspended, they might be forced to litigate which would include court cost and sherif fees, or they would use other means of collection enforced by state and federal laws. 

Also, I don’t know if this is relevant or not but i’ll include it just in case. Shortly after the accident I switched insurance companies because I found a cheaper price. Not sure if that had anything to do with the missing claim or not. 

Now I’m scared. I feel way in over my head here. I am a broke college student struggling to get by, I can’t afford to pay over $3000! I also can’t afford to have my license suspended or pay court cost or sheriff fees. I hardly understand any of this. What do I do? I need help!",finance

personalfinance,I'm in quite a bit of debt and am unsure about everything now,"So I have realized that I've been digging this hole for about three years and keep ignoring it hoping it'll fix itself because I'm a fool. I've accumulated $30,000 in debt and I'm in a way partially drowning myself but I'm still able to stay afloat. I'm at the crossroads of my career in the military where I can choose to separate and go back to living life outside the military. But I'm scared to do so because the way I'm living life right now I can still pay my bills and save some what but I'm just tired of the military and would like to leave but deep inside I feel like if I leave the military what if I can't find a job good enough to be making these payments to not get swallowed by all the money I owe and go bankrupt... 

So for the debts like I've stated before have not been smart and made stupid decisions. I have about six credit cards with a total debt of $20,000, some of which thankfully to the SCRA (Service Member Relief Act) have lowered my interest to 4% but not all of them are that low. I do believe I only have two cards with that interest rate, the rest being at about the 18%-25% range. Now for the other $10,000 in debt I have is a personal loan at 27%... 

I know at this point I've royally screwed myself, I'm not even sure if I'm able to get out of the military safely at this point because financially I'm not ready. The only positive thing I have right now is that I put money away into a mutual fund every month which in the time span of two years has made me $800 and I'm currently at about $4,300 on that.

personalfinance,Consolidation Loan - Eliminating Debit,"Hey PF,

I've been researching my options in regards to curbing some of my debt, specifically credit card debt, and was curious of what you guys and gals think/have done.

I actually work in a collections department of a bank, so I constantly see people who are trying to be proactive by taking this route, only to plunge themselves further into an already deep hole. After my research, I've come to the conclusion that a personal loan sounds like my best option. With around $2,500 in credit card debt at 27% interest (average from 3 accounts), ***it sounds logical to get a $2,500 personal loan at a lower interest rate and pay off all three cards with a lump-sum payment - is it that simple?*** 

Will it hurt my credit to have those three accounts open and inactive for a year or two while paying off the personal loan?

Are creditors inclined to close/decrease my accounts due to the inactivity?

If this is the route I take, should I continue to use the cards for necessary purchases, such as gas, just to keep them active?

This line is going to be the details - skip if you just have your personal advise to share - I'm 21, making around $1,700/month + bonus. Car payment $210, Car Insurance $150, Gas $200, Phone $140, Subscriptions $55, Misc. $250, Savings $250. TOTAL $1,255+/- every month in bills. I have 3 credit cards - a student card from CapOne and 2 store cards. My interest rate on all three cards is around 27%. Student card has a $450 bal ($500 line). Walmart card has $400 bal ($500 line). Best Buy card has $1600 bal ($2,000 line). I keep paying at least $50/month on each card but always find myself using it again. I've taken the two store cards out of my wallet and quit shopping online so that I can get the balance down, however, I would like to get even more proactive in taking care of the balance altogether to avoid these interest charges.

personalfinance,Credit card debt help,"I recently got laid off from a good paying job (~$50,000 a year) and am now in a job where I am making roughly $15,000. It has been tough.  

But one of the toughest things is my credit card debt. I furnished an apartment when I moved for the job and have two credit cards.  

I also own another home aside from my apartment which luckily I have turned into a rent house which has helped a bit. 

My mortgage is not very high, luckily, and is actually covered by what the rent is. But I have been considering taking a second mortgage out against my house just for the amount of my credit card debt. I have banked at my small local bank for almost 20 years and my family for generations before that. The interest rates are friendly and what my new mortgage would be would still likely be covered by what I am getting in rent.  

So, long story short, would borrowing the amount I owe to pay that off and erase it be a practical way to get rid of my credit card debt?",finance

btc,"Feel free to remind anyone suggesting that Bitcoin Cash supporters are ""Crypto Keneysians"" that...","The goal of the Bitcoin design was to be implemented as a system of directly, cheaply and easily transferable money. _Cash_, to be specific. Not checks, not promissory notes and certainly not merely as the base metal to support any such systems. **Bitcoins were and are supposed to be as digital gold _coins_. Not gold bars.**

You say Satoshi might no longer agree? I don't _care_. He clearly *did* agree, when he created Bitcoin. If he has a better idea today, let him defend it publicly.

You say that Bitcoin changes? I say that you are a fool if you think sound money should fundamentally deteriorate or be degraded in its ability to be money over time. That it should start out as practical barter payments with gold coins and end up with no ability to use these coins directly whatsoever. That it's somehow more practical that it silently stops functioning as intended, while in the short term retaining name and price as if nothing happened.

**Bitcoin will always be Bitcoin, no matter what you think properly represents it in the realm of cryptocurrencies.**

You say the longest chain is Bitcoin? I say you are naive and don't realize that your mode of thinking would make Bitcoin doomed to fail. Satoshi knew better and was perfectly fine with changing from SHA256 to a different PoW algo if it became necessary. Such changes should just be highly technically motivated and carried out by the honest incentivized miners in the system.

The often quoted important points he made about the longest chain had to do with security among different chains and technical necessity within a single network. This should not be misconstrued to mean that having the most PoW can justify just _any_ system inheriting the name Bitcoin. That would be outright fraud.

Thinking that money becomes a store of value from it's immutable ability and role as money, is not Keneysianism. If anything, it's Misesianism or Rothbardianism, just as it was the view of Rand.

**BCH is just as free market as Bitcoin ever was. Much more so than what Bitcoin Core did to the network and by large still does, which is to prevent many of the free market functions inherent in the actual design.**

- They ignored Satoshis views on central planning and against the design intentionally centrally planned higher fees in order to compensate for a made up scenario where allegedly the fee prices would be unable to adjust in time as the rewards disappeared.

- They caused artifical hyper-deflation (probably spurring on the bull runs, which was a nice side benefit) along the way, only by making many coin balances unspendable/highly taxed by monetary policy.

- They created the need to use the available block space only as a fractional reserve and instead transfer the ""proof of ownership"" through other networks. 

- They also quoted Satoshi out of context to justify downgrading 0-conf and further handicap the network, because they thought it would make adding and pulling bids in the newly established higher price ""fee market"" (complete newspeak, since a market in fees already existed and was meant to trend as close as possible toward 0 sat/transaction) more smooth.

- They act as if miners are a problem to be handled, rather than market actors conforming to the free market incentives which we ought to base the system on. 

Satoshi however was very clear that there would eventually be only a few, professionally run, large anonymous network nodes (miners) and that these would connect LAN farms of so called ""client nodes"". - This was how he ran multiple nodes himself early on. This was the scenario which he explained as sound, since there would be economic incentive to include transactions.

The users would then connect using simple wallets that merely kept the private keys and by default followed the longest chain in the network. This was called Simplified Payment Verification and would be the so called ""client only mode"" of the reference Bitcoin software. 

**If you want to impose economic equality, want to isolate yourself from or limit the market pricing mechanism, systematically disable competition in the market place or you oppose wealth accumulation, you reject the market. It's that simple. You are not a Crypto Austrian. You know what you are.**

Bitcoin was not made this way. It was made to **take advantage** of the already well known tendencies of capital, not to work against it.",cryptocurrency

Hello everyone, I figured I would do a yearly update and crosspost to both PF and the FIRE subreddit. 

**THE DEBT**

Down to 362K as of today.

I ended up refinancing my loans to a private lender. I debated long and hard about continuing with PSLF, but in the end, the risks far outweighed the potential benefit. There was no guarantee that my loans would be forgiven, especially as my employer was not 501c3 certified. Even though it is considered a non-profit and provides public health services (it is an independent physician group and is not technically part of the hospital), there is nothing to prevent the government from denying the forgiveness claim.  I ended up refinancing to a 3.8% fixed rate loan for 6 years. However, I have been paying biweekly instead of monthly, and that has shaved off a significant time off of my payoff period. 

Deciding to refinance was one of the toughest financial decisions I made. It may be possible that I could have gotten my loans forgiven had I stuck with it, but I simply wasn’t willing to take the chance of my loans ballooning to a massive amount (my average interest rate for all my loans pre-refinancing was about 6.8%), and then finding out I didn’t qualify for PSLF. Ultimately, I feel better about paying off loans at a regular interval, and watching the total principle decrease. Although it’s easy for me to say I wish I had started paying off in residency, hindsight is 20/20 and what’s done is done. I’ve made the commitment to get rid of my loans, and to be honest, it feels like a dark cloud has started to lift knowing that they are finally being payed off. 

Again, I have no credit card debt, and pay off everything at the end of the month.

**PERSONAL STUFF AND EXPENSES**

Still not married and have no children. I did date another physician this past year, but she ended up moving across the country (which was in the works before she met me). We separated amicably, and I although I do feel sad, it was for the best.  My car now has 130k miles, but I’m starting to feel the pull of lifestyle creep. I can’t help but constantly look up newer model cars, and think about how much better my 15min commute would be with heated/cooled seats. I follow Doug Demuro on YouTube, and wish I had a car worthy of being reviewed for it’s quirks and features. I'm still leaning hard towards a CPO Tesla!

I’ve decided to update my wardrobe once a year, but only around great sales. This year, Macy’s had a great deal around Veteran’s day, where they had an extra 20% off coupon. Ended up purchasing a ton of dress shirts, pants, and shoes for less than $300. I’m subscribed to /r/frugalmalefashion which is where I can keep an eye out for these deals. 

I reduced expenses:

* Again called my ISP and was able to keep my 50/10 internet for $30. My modem and router have paid for themselves, so again, no rental fees :)
* Ended up joining my brother’s family plan. Cost was an extra $18 to his plan, which I pay off. Over the last 2 years, I've reduced my cell phone bill from $75-&gt;$55-&gt;$20!
* Kept my Costco executive membership and am using their credit card.  This combo essentially pays for itself through the combined 4% cash back, as well as 4% off their gas (which is already about 20c cheaper than surrounding gas stations). 

**THE JOB**

Received a promotion, with a stipend attached to it. It’s a little more administrative than I thought, but it’s providing me with an opportunity to learn leadership skills. 

**THE BENEFITS/INVESTMENTS**

* 403(b): 18.5k fully maxed out last year. For 2018 and going forward, I’m spreading the investments over the year. 
* Non-governmental 457: 18.5k fully maxed out last year. Again, for 2018 going forward, I’m spreading the investments over the year.
* 401(a): employer contributed. Finally qualified this year!
* Roth IRA: $5500 fully funded the beginning of every year. I have basically been setting aside $211 every pay period so that I can fund at the beginning of next year. 
* Emergency fund: fully funded. Ended up closing out my Ally CDs early since their savings interest rate was more attractive than the CD. 
* Taxable brokerage accounts: I ended up keeping only the Vanguard account open. I haven’t really been contributing as I have been saving up to purchase a home in the area. I do have 2 individual stocks I purchased near the end of last year which have done reasonably well. I’m a fan of index funds, but these 2 were “fun” stocks to play around with. 
* Cryptocurrency: I really wish I wasn’t greedy or had FOMO syndrome. I could have made a small profit had I sold at the peak. Instead, I only have about 25% of my original investment left. My only saving grace is that I did not pour too much into this, and can absorb the losses. Do I truly regret it, though? Not really…I was thankfully reserved enough not to invest too heavy, and I can treat it as a lesson learned (albeit a pricey one). 

**NET WORTH**

* Since I started calculating this in October of last year, my net worth has gone from -$311k to -$170k. Using excel’s trendline tool, I’m expecting to hit net 0 in September 2019. 

Here’s a [visual](https://imgur.com/a/tsD3VUi) of my net worth, debt load, and investment value since I started tracking in October 2017.


**THE PLAN FOR THIS COMING YEAR**

1.	Continue to max out 403b, 457, and backdoor Roth IRA. Once I save up 20% for a down payment, I’ll restart m contributions to the taxable brokerage account.  
2.	Continue to pay off student loans regularly. Currently I have under 5 years left on my loan repayments (I have been paying a little extra every month in addition to making biweekly payments). Having an auto-debit from my banking account has done a lot to ease my mind. Any extra cash I make will be used to pay off loans. 
3.	Continue contributing to nephew and niece college funds.  
4.	Since I have started making massive student loan repayments, I have been able to avoid lifestyle creep simply because I don’t have the money to do so. That being said, although I still live like a resident, I don't have to live like a hermit. I was able to afford a vacation abroad this past year, I continue to have dinners and drinks with friends, and am still able to afford the occasional nice bottle of Japanese whiskey once every few months.

personalfinance,Student loan settlement,"This is my first time posting here so apologies if I am not using the correct format. 

I currently have a federal student loan, owed to the US Dept of Education that is being handled by Pioneer Credit Recovery. The total loan amount is approximately $62,000. After speaking with Pioneer yesterday, I can get a settlement for $39,000 and the loan is considered paid for. However, I have to come up with this money in 90 Days. 

My question: what is my best path here? I do not have great credit (because of my student loans). It seems foolish not to do everything I can to not save nearly $30,000, though. 

I appreciate any help!

Edit: I do not have $39,000 available, I am looking for advice on how I can get that (loans, etc) and if that is my best path. Thanks again!",finance

personalfinance,Question about inheritance tax,"Hi!

I am set to inherit in the very near future about $15,000 from a life insurance policy. I have been told mixed things, including that I will not have to pay taxes on this money. Is this correct?  This is just one portion of the total of money, there are many beneficiaries.

Secondly, over the course of the next while, there will be some real estate sold, of which I will inherit a portion. I am confused on the inheritance tax here as well. Will I be subject to the 40% tax rate, although my portion of the inheritance will be quite small and significantly below the federal and state cut off? The total real estate value is something like $8 million.  Also, how does this work when the real estate is in two states, and I live in a third state?",finance

So first off we are married, I am in the military and she is about to start a new job (bartender/waitress, so mostly tip based).  We are confused as to how to fill out the W4 since we file jointly for federal taxes but will need to file separate state returns since she is a resident of our current state (VA) and I still pay state taxes to my home of record (WI).  I have tried the online calculator, however since she has not started here yet we don't really have a solid idea of what her income will be, or even a ball park really.  To add to that I spent some time in a combat zone this year so my overall taxable income is much lower than it will be in the future. 

We are trying to figure out if we should put married filing jointly or married but withhold at higher single rate.  We would also like to not owe any money back on her state or our federal (I have never owed money myself and usually have a decent return federally)  Any help, guidance, or resources I can read through would be greatly appreciated.  Please let me know if there is any other additional information I should be adding.  Thank you.",finance
MachineLearning,[D] Active Learning with Human-in-the-Loop,"Hi guys,

I did a lot of research and can't find a satisfactory answer. I have just a quick question about Active Learning and would be pleased if you could answer it.

I'm still wondering if active learning only fit for the training of a classifier? I know it can help to reduce the size of the training data while iteratively learning from an unlabeled data pool using human annotation. But all papers and literature I could found refer only to the training phase of classifiers. Is it also possible if the classifier is ""live"" and make some predictions to use the new observations to actively learn from them? **To fed back the new data points into the model so it has additional training data to learn from?**

For example, if the classifier has a low confidence about a prediction or the prediction is wrong, can this new information be used to improve the classifier?

In this context, I've read a lot about Human-in-the-Loop with active learning. If I look at [this presentation](https://www.slideshare.net/BillLiu31/natural-intelligence-the-human-factor-in-ai), then I would said yes, it can continuously learning actively. Facebook's DeepFace is described, where the algorithm ask a human to help with labeling if it is uncertain about the face (page 63). Or by adding a human feedback loop on page 82.

I also found another real-world example where [Coca Cola](https://developers.googleblog.com/2017/09/how-machine-learning-with-tensorflow.html) claims to use active learning. A user can correct invalid predictions and the algorithm could be improved over time via active learning (sounds similar to Facebook's DeepFace): 

In fact, I have found some more real-world example where I believe or the companies say that they use active learning. For example, at figure-eight. **But nobody says how they implement it. Many questions are raised. For example, does every new data point help? How many data points must be collected until you can learn actively? Which is the right batch size?** I know it depends on the use case, but its very difficult to find good literature or papers about this intention.

personalfinance,How to budget for mandatory retirement contributions?,"Hi folks. I’m a federal employee under FERS-FRAE. This means that 4.4% of my gross pay is deducted for retirement. 

Now, the fed pays a lot more in than my 4.4%, so this is a net benefit to me. I’m wondering what the best way to account for this in my budget is.

personalfinance,"First-time home buyer, am I aiming too high?","Hi /r/personalfinance,

I'm looking for some input on how much house I can realistically afford without spreading myself too thin.

A little background info: I'm currently renting an apartment and looking to buy in the Pittsburgh area.  I've got a stable job that I've been at for a little over 6 years and don't anticipate any changes for the foreseeable future.

I've been looking at houses priced up to $275k, though preferably lower.  I haven't had as much luck
looking in my current price range, so I'm considering looking at houses up to and possibly over
$300k.  
Depending on taxes/insurance, this would put the monthly housing costs somewhere between
$1,600-$1,900, depending how high I go.

Some numbers:

* Income
  * Gross annual income: ~$88,000
  * Average monthly take-home: ~$4,650
  * Putting 14.5% towards 401k, including company match
  * Rough bi-weekly paycheck breakdown:

     Category | Amount
     ---------|-------:
     Salary | 3373
     Taxes | -823
     Medical/dental/vision | -46
     401k | -337
     HSA | -19
     Remaining | ~2147
* Debt
  * Total Debt: ~$22,000
  * Interest rates range from 3.4% to 5.75%
  * Monthly Debt Payments: $622
     * My car payment makes up $183 of this, and will be paid off in February. The rest are school loans.
* Savings
  * $10,000 dedicated emergency fund
  * ~$50,000 in 401k
  * ~$12,000 in Roth IRA
  * General savings excluding the above: ~$135k
     * 20% down payment and closing costs will come from here

Am I aiming too high?  Should I stick to my current price range?  
Any input is appreciated.

(Mea culpa: I realize $135k is a lot to just have sitting in savings. For a while, I didn't pay much attention to how I was managing, or rather failing to manage, my savings, but I'm trying to be more on top of it. Besides using it for a down payment I plan to throw more of it at my school loans to burn them down.)",finance
personalfinance,Need serious advice regarding my last year and a half of college. I've maxed out pell grants and federal aid!,"Hello,

I am 35 credits away from receiving a bachelors in music education with a teaching certificate. It would take three more semesters. Unfortunately, I can no longer pay for college (from my understanding) without taking out private student loans. The only real solution I see is using the credits I've completed to finish college now with a vanilla music degree, but it's such a bitter end to my undergraduate life seeing how I completed the majority of music education classes already; now it seems that was just a waste of money and time. Sure, I gained knowledge and experience that will help me with my future career, but the wasted time and money stings.

I spoke with an advisor that suggests that I get my teaching certificate online elsewhere and that I go to graduate school and get a masters in music education in the same amount of time it would have taken me to graduate with a bachelors in music education. Does this seem like a good idea? I need some guidance as I've really ""dropped the ball"" so to speak. I should have been more wary of these federal loan limits, but it didn't cross my mind until it was too late.

Thank you.

personalfinance,Taking out Additional Student Loans to Pay Down PMI?,"My mortgage has a 4% interest rate. Home value is $130,000, current mortgage balance is \~$121,000. I'm paying $98 dollars a month in PMI, which according to this PMI calculator ([http://artofbeingcheap.com/removing-pmi/](http://artofbeingcheap.com/removing-pmi/)) brings my effective interest rate on my home to over 10%. I need to pay the balance down to $101,000 in order to remove the PMI.

I am currently taking classes part-time toward an MBA while working full time and have the option to take out student loans at around 6-6.5% interest. I can take out around $7,000 this semester and can take out another $7,000 next fall. (I don't take classes during the spring due to a busy work schedule.)

I would place the $7,000 from this fall in 1 year CD paying around 2.5% interest and then make a large payment next fall that would be enough to remove PMI.

My thought process behind this idea:

A potentially lower interest rate on my overall debt

I currently don't have enough deductions, especially under the new tax plan. to itemize on my taxes, making the tax benefits of mortgage interest and PMI useless.

I make \~$45k a year, allowing me to deduct up to $2,500 of student interest as an above the line tax deduction.

Is there anything I am missing or overlooking before I commit to taking out these student loans?

personalfinance,Seeking advice - How best do I invest my money will little knowledge (UK),"I recently came into £20,000, I have never owned this much money and am a little bit lost about what I should do with it. I don't have any experience investing/saving money. 

I'm recently self employed, work is a little slow at times and I'm not saving much from my earnings, but I'm getting by fine. Work will pick up. Besides my student loan, I have no other debts.

I used £3,000 to buy equipment for my job. I'm a filmmaker and this kit will pay itself off in a year or so (my last £2,500 investment paid itself off in 6 months). I also used around £1,000 to pay off my overdraft. I'm holding on to £1000 which may also go towards kit if work requires it.

I have around £15,000 in which I want to use as wisely as possible and build upon. As little as that may be, it will be good practise for me to learn to save and be financially responsible.

I have considered an ISA, but I imagine there are options that will give me higher interest rates. I'd like to add to my savings over the next 3 years, with a goal of being able to buy a property, and continue saving after that goal has been reached.

I'm willing to learn about the stock market, as long as it's safe for me to invest here. I'm willing to put fingers in different pies if it provides me a safety net. Most importantly, I'm willing to learn.

What are my options? Should I put it all in an ISA for now, and slowly invest in the stock market? Put it all in stock? Premium bonds? Any advice will be greatly appreciated.

hydro,Anyone have experience using chlorine to control pathogens?,"Running my first hydro system this season.  System is outdoors, top-fed recirculating.  My reservoir is buried, nonetheless water temp has been a bit of an issue (or has it?).   Res temps usually hover around 74-76 deg, and on the hottest part of the hottest days, they have measured over 80. 

Have been using hydroguard and everything seemed to be going really well until this week.   Last res change about 7-10 days ago, my hose filter broke so I had to use straight tap water and figured ""no point in putting the hydroguard in now, will wait till the chlorine dissipates"".   And of course I forgot to add it.  Weather has also been really hot, humid, cloudy, thunderstorms the last few weeks. What was previously my most impressive, healthiest plant - a cucumber - got walloped with powdery mildew, and root rot has set in.  Not sure if one lead the other, if the lack of hydroguard made it inevitable or it was just bad timing, but not looking good. Other plants in the system seem ok, but it looks like some of my pepper plants have stopped flowering, and their roots look a little weak to me.

As I've been researching for ways to remedy, most of the content that I've come across comes from the cannabis community targeted at single-plant DWC configurations.  Not really an exact match for a recirculating system feeding vegetables that will be consumed by my family.  

A small handful of pages I've come across discuss using chlorine, either from pool shock (calcium hypochlorite) or bleach (sodium hypochlorite).  Was just wondering if anyone has used this for vegetables.   How harmful would it be to the plants?  Or if not harmful to them, how can it affect the leaves and fruits that we eat?

I'm thinking - a solution that is a similar strength to pool water - how harmful could it be?   Pools stay clean, but grass surrounding the pool does just fine even though tons of pool water gets splashed on it.  What about a scenario where you run a pool-strength solution for a day or half a day between res changes, just to kill everything off, then you refill with clean water and resume nutrients and hydroguard?",energy

We also have significant student debt. We owe 180k with an average 5% interest. It is a mix of private and federal loans, with about a 2:1 ratio of private to federal. Required payments are about $1000 a month, but we typically pay considerably more since we are trying to pay down the debt.   
 

I started a new job earlier this year making 150k a year before taxes, with a bonus potential of 15% of base salary. My wife makes 30k a year before taxes. 

We live about 30 minutes from where we work, and it takes an hour or more to get from where we live to Seattle during normal traffic. 

The housing situation in the Seattle area is messy. Home values have skyrocketed and it is difficult to discern whether we are in a bubble or if the high prices are a new normal.   
 

My goal is to increase overall wealth over the next few years. We have enough equity and income to afford a more expensive home, but are also carrying considerable debt. What would you do in this situation? Pay down debt? Level-up the home?   
 

We have considered many options all of them have trade-offs and upsides.  
 

* Selling our house, using the equity to purchase a more expensive and comfortable home closer to the city. 
* Staying put, using our high income to pay down debt and sell when we are either debt free or lower debt to income ratio. 
* Restructuring debt by refinancing the house and paying off loans with the additional equity. 
* Buying a rental property in the area we would like to live, and staying in place while we pay off debt.",finance
personalfinance,Should I sell my car to help pay off debts?,"Hello, let me preface this by saying my financial decisions as an adult the last 10 years have not been great, and there are many I regret, like buying this car. My fiance and I are getting married this October and have both committed to paying down as much debt as possible so that we can buy a lower cost house in the next 1-2 years and be debt free in the next 10ish years. So my question is, based on the below info, should I sell my car?

Two years ago I bought a new 2016 Mazda 3 Hatchback. At the time I was making about $53k a year and it seemed like a good investment to get a car that would last me a long time. I was able to put $10k down and get an interest rate of 3.8% so my monthly payment is $220 a month and my insurance is $520 a quarter. Fast forward to end of last year and I have a medical problem that causes me to go hourly at my job and drops my income to $18/hour working 20-40 hours a week. After medical insurance and taxes come out, my take home is almost exactly $10/hour. The Kelly Bluebook value of my car is averaged at $13,000, if I sold it myself more in the $15,000 range. I have $8,000 remaining on the car loan and $12,000 in credit card debt, no student loans or other debt. My parents have a 2001 Avalon that is in excellent shape and they would be willing to give it to me.

Should I sell my car, pay off the loan and use the remainder to knock out some credit card debt? I won't get my initial investment back but my reasoning is that my monthly costs would drop allowing me to save and pay down that credit card debt. I currently spend about $120 in gas plus the payment and insurance its around $500 a month for everything. At the current rate I would pay the car off in 2.5 years if I kept it. I'm about to go back full time and expect to be making around $40k but it could be as low as $30k (hopefully not), I would be back on employer healthcare so that massive monthly cost would go down as well. Based on my budgeting I could afford the car once I go full time (I'm net negative every month right now) but I would not be saving hardly anything and only making minimum payments on credit cards (which has been the story of my 20s thus far). If I did take my parents Avalon the plan would be to keep it until it dies (hopefully get at least 1 year) and when I buy another car do what I should have done to begin with and get something used instead of buying a $20k+ car. Thank you so much for your help!",finance
personalfinance,Student Loan Refinancing,"Hello, I have about $24k in student loans to be repaid and about 7 more years on payments. I'm fine making the payments right now, they aren't overly burdensome to my budget, but the interest rate on all of them is about 6.8%. I'm not sure where that falls on the spectrum but it seems a bit high to me (at least compared to loans with collateral, which I realize this isn't). My credit is mid-700s and I've got a decent income etc. etc.. Should I look into refinancing these? If so, what's a good, reputable, way to go about this?",finance
personalfinance,Should I continue to pay off student loan debt while also investing for retirement or completely pay off loans and then invest for retirement?,"Hi r/personalfinance,

I check this sub everyday, and am a longtime lurker though I may have posted here once before.

I am 24 and have endeavors to retire around 50/55. With a fairly strict budget I have about $1,150/month to either pay off student loans or invest for retirement. I have a 3 month emergency fund.

I have been out of school and working full time for about a year and half and at the beginning I had always thought I should pay off loans first and then invest for retirement. However, after digging a little more into the issue I believed the best course of action was to do both as my student loans were between 4-5% interest.

I have $48,089.05 in student loans at a 4.84% interest rate. My current course of action is that I would pay $650/month towards my student loans (including \~300 min. payment) and invest $500 within my 401k.

As I just recently started saving for retirement, my account only sits at $400, but then I began some scenarios.

1.) Through unbury.me, if I paid $650 a month to my student loans, it would take 7 years and 4 months where I would be   
paying a total of $56,542.80 (including $8,453.75 interest)

Using a compounding calculator, at $500 a month with the $400 in my account already, I would be investing $6000 a year and using a 6% average return for the 7 years I would have $53,486.26 within my account at the end of my loans.

Using this exact amount and then taking the $650 I had been using on my loans I would be investing $1150/month for the next 19 years (to 50) and using a 6% average return I would have $657,181.96 within my account.

2.) If I paid $1150 a month to my student loans it would take 4 years where I would be paying a total of $52,438.34 (including $4,349.29 in interest).

Using a compounding calculator, at $1,150 a month I would investing $13,800 a year for the next 23 years (to 50) and using a 6% average return I would have $688,982.87 within my account.

My question is if this math is correct? I had always thought that finding a middle ground in my loans and retirement that I would end up with more at the end of it all due to the 6% vs 4.84% interest, it seems like the latter is more worthwhile however. 

With any case, under these circumstance if there is another option could anyone please lead me in the right direction to maximize NW at 50? Thank you all!",finance
personalfinance,Trying to figure out which lender is better when it comes to buying a house,"First time poster so please excuse if I don't provide enough details. Will edit to provide any other details necessary.

My wife and I are in the process of buying our 2nd home (looking to rent out of current house now).  We have so far gotten 2 pre-approval for lenders and are trying to figure out which one is more beneficial in the long run as we plan to stay at this new house for 10+ years.

Lender 1: 5% interest rate with no PMI,
4.75% if we bought one discount point (not sure if this is relevant)

Lender 2: 4.875% rate with PMI

Both lenders are willing to match terms and conditions if presented with better offer so I'm not sure how to approach that situation since both has its pros and cons.

investing,Bearish Due Diligence,"# Warning: Bearish DD

Hello r/investing. I made this DD recently. Its basically a bunch of numbers, compared to previous market. I cannot stress this enough, please draw your own conclusions. 

*Disclaimer: The term overvalued is kinda just a buzzword. It is compared to previous bull markets. Take it with a grain of salt.* 

**For the past nine years, the equities market has seen one of the best percent gains since the Bull Market of 1948-1969. Corporate taxes are low, GDP growth is strong, and joblessness well below the Natural Rate of Unemployment (NRU).**

However, quite a few ratios, economic data, and past performances are pointing to the conclusion that this bull market is close to its conclusion. For all data, I will be using the S&amp;P 500 Index. Sorry Dow Jones and Nasdaq. Nobody loves you (well I love Nasdaq fuck Dow).

**Buffet Indicator**

Not to be confused with the Buffet Rule, the Buffet Indicator compares the Total Market Capitalization (Market Cap) of the stock market divided by the Total GDP.

|Ratio = Total Market Cap / GDP|Valuation|
|:-|:-|
|Ratio &lt; 50%|Significantly Undervalued|
|50% &lt; Ratio &lt; 75%|Modestly Undervalued|
|75% &lt; Ratio &lt; 90%|Fair Valued|
|90% &lt; Ratio &lt; 115%|Modestly Overvalued|
|Ratio &gt; 115%|Significantly Overvalued|

As of 8/1/18, the Total Market Cap is 142.8% more than the total GDP. This indicates a significantly overvalued market. In 2000, one of the most notorious bubbles, the total market capped topped out at 148.5% of GDP. The 2009 lead up, had a top valuation of 110.7%. For the past 20 years, the market has reacted to an overvalued market by returning to a “Fairly Valued” TMC to GDP ratio. After the tech bubble burst, the market went from a high of 148.5% to a low of 75.2%, a decrease of almost half. With the current market approaching former tech bubble numbers, a bear market does not seem far off.

*The Buffet Indicator has drawn a lot of criticism recently. I will indulge why in a future post.*

**Shiller P/E Ratio**

The Shiller P/E Ratio is a better measure of valuation than normal P/E. It accounts for the fluctuations of inflation due to the business cycle, therefore providing a more accurate picture of the true value of the security. Thankfully, there is a plethora of data surrounding the Shiller P/E ratio, all the way back to 1890.

MIN: 4.78 (DEC 1920)

MAX: 44.19 (Dec 1999)

RANGE: 39.41

**Price To Sales (Revenue) Ratio**

The Price to Sales Ratio (PSR), like the P/E ratio, is a way of measuring value. Instead of comparing a company’s price to earnings, it compares a company’s stock price to its revenues.

|Price/Revenue Per Share|Valuation|
|:-|:-|
| PSR= 0-1|Undervalued|
|PSR= 1-2|Fairly Valued|
|PSR= 2-3|Overvalued|
|PSR= 3+|Significantly Overvalued|

The current for the S&amp;P500 is 2.23, and at the height of the tech bubble, 2.44, indicating overvaluation. The chart below shows that until the late 90s, P/S never topped 1.3.

The graph above shows the S&amp;P grouped into deciles (each of ten equal groups into which a population can be divided according to the distribution of values of a particular variable (in this case Price to Sales Ratio)). Decile 10 shows that extreme speculation, especially in 2000, is centered on a fraction of stocks; in case of 2000 those stocks were tech. Currently, with the exception of Decile 10, the S&amp;P is the most overvalued it has ever been.

**Yield Curve**

Now we move away from the fun world of ratios and into the world of monetary policy. The Yield Curve is the curve of maturity and interest rates. It is a crucial market sentiment indicator about the future of the economy.

The normal yield curve shows that the shorter the maturity, the lower the yield.

[https://imgur.com/FLrnWJ4](https://imgur.com/FLrnWJ4)

The flat yield curve indicates a transition from an expansion to a downturn. Shorter maturities have the same yields as the

longer maturities.

[https://imgur.com/55oabKn](https://imgur.com/55oabKn)

The Inverted Yield Curve is a strong indicator of coming recession. Shorter maturities have higher yields than longer maturities.

[https://imgur.com/IqJsAOL](https://imgur.com/IqJsAOL)

We are currently in a flat yield curve.

**Bull Exhaustion** Bull exhaustion, a rapid rise in stock followed by a tail off called an exhaustion gap. Bull exhaustion is common during the peak of the bull market, and is a indication of a slowdown. This can be clearly seen in the correction in early February.

[https://imgur.com/b853lLx](https://imgur.com/b853lLx)

The failure of the market to recover to its previous high (it has been 6 months, and the S&amp;P hasn't recovered fully yet), combined with the low volume over the past few months, shows clear symptoms of Bull exhaustion.

**Dow Theory (the Public)**

Dow Theory is an one hundred year old theory about the stock market written by Charles H. Dow (the Dow in Dow Jones). While some of it isn’t relevant anymore (the reliance of railroads indicating trends) a lot of it still is relevant. The “Market Trends” part of Dow Theory is still particular relevant, especially in the realm of behavioral economics. Dow Theory states that there are three trends to the bull/bear cycle.

1. Accumulation Phase

a. In the beginning of the bull market “In the know” investors with a long-term outlook, and buy and hold.

2. Public Participation Phase

a. The Public and amateur investors join into the market. The uptrend becomes more obvious.

3. Distribution Phase

a. The final stage of the bull market. The “in the know” investors cash out, amateurs continue to join. Rampant speculation ensues. The market enters a downtrend. One of the trends I can definitely see today is the speculating public. Amateur “investors” through apps like Robinhood can now easily speculate with options and margin.

[https://imgur.com/pCIZCMl](https://imgur.com/pCIZCMl)

I believe we are in either late Public Participation Phase, or very early Distribution phase.

Anyway. Draw your own conclusions. This is my first DD. Feedback and criticism is welcome. I will be doing more of these. If you would like to check out my Youtube channel, which will be updated soon with these type of DDs, feel free to check it out.

The failure of the market to recover to its previous high (it has been 6 months, and the S&amp;P hasn't recovered fully yet), combined with the low volume over the past few months, shows clear symptoms of Bull exhaustion.

**Dow Theory (the Public)**

Dow Theory is an one hundred year old theory about the stock market written by Charles H. Dow (the Dow in Dow Jones). While some of it isn’t relevant anymore (the reliance of railroads indicating trends) a lot of it still is relevant. The “Market Trends” part of Dow Theory is still particular relevant, especially in the realm of behavioral economics. Dow Theory states that there are three trends to the bull/bear cycle.

1. Accumulation Phase

a. In the beginning of the bull market “In the know” investors with a long-term outlook, and buy and hold.

2. Public Participation Phase

a. The Public and amateur investors join into the market. The uptrend becomes more obvious.

3. Distribution Phase

a. The final stage of the bull market. The “in the know” investors cash out, amateurs continue to join. Rampant speculation ensues. The market enters a downtrend. One of the trends I can definitely see today is the speculating public. Amateur “investors” through apps like \*redacted due to r/stonks rules\* can now easily speculate with options and margin.

[https://imgur.com/pCIZCMl](https://imgur.com/pCIZCMl)

I believe we are in either late Public Participation Phase, or very early Distribution phase.

Anyway. Draw your own conclusions. This is my first DD. Feedback and criticism is welcome. I will be doing more of these.

personalfinance,Should I take out grad loans or pay cash?,"I'm starting grad school in a few weeks (12k a semester, 6 semesters). My company may reimburse me $10k/year, but not until June 2018 (at the earliest). If I can pay my first tuition bill in cash, is there any reason for me to take a loan? My instinct is to just pay cash, but if my employer will pay some of it, that's free money, so I'm just trying to weigh my options.

The loan I'm looking at is the federal unsubsidized at 6.6% interest, that accrues immediately.

I'm hoping someone else has thought through this scenario.

personalfinance,"Loan 122k, starting salary 70k, best course of action (IBR, standar, etc)?","Hi all,

Doing my best to be financially vigilant here. Let me get straight to the point: **what is the best course of action regarding paying off loans?** Here is some information:

**Student** **Loans (all federal):**

122k weighted interest rate 6.11%

**Starting Salary:**

70k, with 90% 401k match

**ROTH IRA:**

35k (since inception 2015: \~25% ROI)

**Other expenses/debt:**

\~1k credit card debt (score 750)

**Rent: (TBD)** I am looking for a place to stay! but I can't decide how much I should spend on rent! I've been living with roommates for the past 5 years, and I've had horrible experiences before.

I am  27 years old and single, I am starting my career as an entry PhD scientist in biotech. I did my best to ward off the compounding interest as a graduate student, but my student stipend made it very difficult to do so, so I decided to invest my savings into a ROTH IRA to beat the loan interest rate over the past 3 years. My starting salary is unfortunately low (this is my first real job), but **my goal by the time I'm 32 is to at least hit the 105-120k mark**. I'm not sure how feasible this is, but I'm always trying to push myself and strive to be better every day (I hope this work mentality gets me to where I want to go). With luck and my work ethic, I was able to finish my PhD in 3.5 years. I love what I do, but I am unfortunately a workaholic and my personal life has taken a huge beating because of it. I want to get going on my personal life --&gt; **spending more time with family, friends, and hopefully fall into a serious relationship with somebody** . I spent my early to mid 20's just focusing on my studies and though I am glad that I did, I want a slight change in focus.

Taking everything into consideration, what do you all think is the best course of action? Should I make minimum payments on the loan so I can afford a 1b/1ba apt. and invest my savings to try and continuously beat the interest rate? should I refinance my loans? should I look into income-based-repayment? Should I just deal with roommates and pay it off aggressively ? I have a grace period of 6 months for my loans.

Thanks everyone!",finance
personalfinance,Questions about Joint Bank Accounts After Marriage,"I have the following questions about joining bank accounts after marriage.  My wife and I intend to pool all of our combined income into one account.

1. For credit cards, should you sign up for new joint credit card accounts or choose whomever has the better credit cards (based on line of credit, credit score, perks, etc.) and make the other person an authorized user on those cards?
2. How much does cancelling an unused credit card really hurt your credit score?  I have access to a free online website where you can run different scenarios and see how it affects your credit score.  It looks like cancelling old cards can have a pretty noticeable affect on credit score based on what I saw on there.  Does it make sense to keep old credit cards with one bank and just not use them, if you are going to be switching banks?
3. If right now one of us has a better credit score than the other and we intend to get a home loan in the near future, should we hold off on merging accounts until after buying a house?  Is there any chance the combined bank account will lead to a worse interest rate on a home loan?
4. I have read through different posts on this subreddit and other websites about joint bank accounts, so I know some of the pros and cons, but if anybody has any other tips from personal experience that would be much appreciated.

Thanks.",finance

Am I reading this correctly and why are they just now billing me almost six years later?

I'm just tired of paying so much of my income to it.  I've already tired the variety of repayment options the current lenders have to try to lower my payments, but all their options pretty much end up as pay less now to pay more later.

personalfinance,Is It Advisable To Have Money Scattered Around In Multiple Of The Same Type Of Account (Multiple Checking/Savings &amp; Brokerage),"I am wondering if it is advisable or ill-advised to have money in multiple of the same account.  For example: I had a checking/savings account before getting married.  When I got married a few years ago we started a joint checking/savings account.  We have 80% in our joint and 20% in my old account for no real reason.  Is this good or bad?

**MORE IMPORTANTLY**  Is it advisable to have 80% of savings in an high interest rate savings and 20% in a more standard bank?  I was doing some research on [NERDWALLET'S](https://www.nerdwallet.com/banking/best-savings-accounts?trk_copy=hpbestsavings) about checking/savings.  Would it be OK to put 80% in an account like the Marcus Goldman Sachs and use a normal bank (PNC/Chase) for daily use?  Are there pros/cons to multiple accounts like this?

**ALSO IMPORTANT**  Is it OK to have multiple investment/brokerage accounts?  For example, is it OK to use ETrade AND Ameritrade (or Ally &amp; ETrade)?  Are there pros/cons to having both?  Would it be OK to use one for Long term investments (like IRA's or Index Funds) and one for more frequent short term trading?

personalfinance,$8k CC debt; $1.2k hospital debt; should I take out a consolidation loan?,"So I have about 5 credit cards with a total balance of around $8000.

I make all my payments on time, but only the minimum since I'm struggling with keeping the roof over my head, car payment, etc. as well.

I pay about that on my CCs every month anyway so in reality I'd be saving on monthly payments.

So, I need some help calculating the best way to pay some student loans.  Basically,  I'm budgeting $700 per month towards student loans.  I want to pay them off as fast as possible and as cheap as possible.

I've tried to reverse engineer payments and time frames and different amounts and am struggling to tie together how when 1 loan is paid off, to best allocate the money I was paying towards the paid off loan to the remaining loans.

Does anyone have a tool or way to calculate the best way to approach this? Of course, I need to make a minimum payment on each loan each month, just want to spend the least amount of money overall, based on the $700/month allocation.

loan 1	 $8,077.00 	11.500%

personalfinance,"Advice on Graduate Loans, Debt, and Mental Health (Domestic Abuse)","Howdy folks, throwing up this post on my throwaway for a few reasons as I’ll explain later. Let me start off with some background:

Late 20s, occupation: teacher

Finances:

-40k salary w/ 28% Annual PERS contribution and included co-op insurance. 
-After taxes, &amp;c, it equates to approximately 3,000 monthly take home.

-Approx. 20k in PERS account, 1k in general investment portfolio, 1k in long-term saving. 

-General assets: Desirable collector vehicular valued approx $5,500 in current condition. 2011 car, valued at $9,000, professional camera equipment, could sell for approx $4,000 (from prior career and moonlighting) 

Expenses (monthly)
+$300 Car payment
+$180  Car insurance/phone (to parents)
+$1000 Tuition (payment plan w/ university, not loans)
+$15 charitable donation
+$150 gas budget
+$300 grocery budget
+$22  general subscriptions
+$33 Medication costs
=Approx. 2,000

Debt (all ~6% or lower)
+10.7k Sub Stafford Loans (undergrad, currently deferred)
+8.8k Car loan ($277 w/ $33 into principle monthly)
=19.5k

Situation:
After some major setbacks in my life (particular health), I’ve been living back with my folks while I finish off graduate school. This has provided me with a rent-free place to stay while I continue to work full time and pay for my masters in full as I attend graduate school. However, there has also been some major domestic issues also occurring at home, which has already cost me some time away from university (leave of absence), and cost me some major savings (losing 7k on medical bills etc.). I knew that being in the home would be difficult mental health wise, but I chose it due to the financial strain of finishing up my degree. 

Currently, I’m pushing through my program with a graduation date in May, and about $1k in tuition costs until that date (approx 7k left in tuition for 2018-2019). Once completed it should give me a raise to 48k salary with my school district. 

Dilemma: The situation in my currently home has gone south with constant emotional abuse and instances of physical abuse in the last ~6 months. I’ve been able to be headstrong, with a good support network, but it’s taken its emotional toll on me. And with chronic physical health conditions, they are exasperated by it. 

Unfortunately, I can’t afford to leave currently (especially since I had to spend 2k this month on tuition alone due to summer term), with a despot for a place to rent, nor would I be able to afford tuition out of pocket and rent simultaneously. 

I’m debating taking out a federal student loan to cover my last education costs, and moving into an apartment split with an old friend that would cost approx $750 a month, plus some utilities. 

On one hand I love the idea of the freedom and peace of mind, on the other, I hate accruing more debt. 

Another reason I’m in a debate is I am also debating moving out of state once my masters degree is completed for personal reasons. I could also sell my other car and cameras for quick money. But the car has lots of continental value and photography is my main creative outlet, and an occasional side job. 

Any advice is welcome, and please let me know if you need any further information. Thank you folks",finance

**Different Platforms for dApps and Smart-Contracts**

While Ethereum is the most mature dApp framework with both the best developer tools, resources and community, there are other public blockchain platforms. Third generation blockchains are trying to solve Ethereum’s scaling and performance issues. Here is an overview of dApp platforms that can be worth looking into:

**NEO** \- [https://neo.org/](https://neo.org/)  
 The second most mature dApp platform. NEO has better scalability and performance than Ethereum and has 1’000 TPS to ETH’s 15 by utilizing a dBFT consensus algorithm. While better infrastructure, NEO does not have the maturity of Ethereum’s developer tools, documentation and community.

**Cardano** \- [https://www.cardano.org/en/home/](https://www.cardano.org/en/home/)  
 While still in alpha with a long and ambitious roadmap ahead of it, Cardano is one of the most anticipated dApp platforms out there. IOHK, the research and engineering company that maintains Cardano, has listed a lot of great resources and scientific papers that is worth looking into.

IOHK Scientific Papers - [https://iohk.io/research/papers/](https://iohk.io/research/papers/)

**Stellar** \- [https://www.stellar.org/](https://www.stellar.org/)  
 If moving value fast from one party to another by using smart-contracts is the goal, Stellar Lumens is your platform. Initially as an open-source fork from Ripple, Stellar has become one of the mature frameworks for financial applications. Stellar’s focus lies in interoperability with legacy financial systems and cheap/fast value transfer. It’s smart-contract capability is rather limited in comparison to Ethereum and HyperLedger, so take that in consideration.

**Ripple** – www.ripple.com  
 Ripple and its close cousin, Stellar, is two of the most well-known cryptocurrencies and DLT frameworks meant for the financial sector. Ripple enables instant settlement between banks for international transactions.

# Consensus Algorithms

**\[Proof of Work\]** \- very short, cuz it's well-known.

\[1\] Bitcoin - to generate a new block miner must generate hash of the new block header that is in line with given requirements.

Others: Ethereum, Litecoin etc.

**\[Hybrid of PoW and PoS\]**

\[2\] Decred - hybrid of “proof of work” and “proof of stake”. Blocks are created about every 5 minutes. Nodes in the network looking for a solution with a known difficulty to create a block (PoW). Once the solution is found it is broadcast to the network. The network then verifies the solution. Stakeholders who have locked some DCR in return for a ticket\* now have the chance to vote on the block (PoS). 5 tickets are chosen pseudo-randomly from the ticket pool and if at least 3 of 5 vote ‘yes’ the block is permanently added to the blockchain. Both miners and voters are compensated with DCR : PoS - 30% and PoW - 60% of about 30 new Decred issued with a block. \* 1 ticket = ability to cast 1 vote. Stakeholders must wait an average of 28 days (8,192 blocks) to vote their tickets.

**\[Proof of Stake\]**

\[3\] Nxt - The more tokens are held by account, the greater chance that account will earn the right to generate a block. The total reward received as a result of block generation is the sum of the transaction fees located within the block. Three values are key to determining which account is eligible to generate a block, which account earns the right to generate a block, and which block is taken to be the authoritative one in times of conflict: base target value, target value and cumulative difficulty. Each block on the chain has a generation signature parameter. To participate in the block's forging process, an active account digitally signs the generation signature of the previous block with its own public key. This creates a 64-byte signature, which is then hashed using SHA256. The first 8 bytes of the resulting hash are converted to a number, referred to as the account hit. The hit is compared to the current target value(active balance). If the computed hit is lower than the target, then the next block can be generated.

**\[4\] Peercoin (chain-based proof of stake)** \- coin age parameter. Hybrid PoW and PoS algorithm. The longer your Peercoins have been stationary in your account (to a maximum of 90 days), the more power (coin age) they have to mint a block. The act of minting a block requires the consumption of coin age value, and the network determines consensus by selecting the chain with the largest total consumed coin age. Reward - minting + 1% yearly.

**\[5\] Reddcoin (Proof of stake Velocity)** \- quite similar to Peercoin, difference: not linear coin-aging function (new coins gain weight quickly, and old coins gain weight increasingly slowly) to encourage Nodes Activity. Node with most coin age weight have a bigger chance to create block. To create block Node should calculate right hash. Block reward - interest on the weighted age of coins/ 5% annual interest in PoSV phase.

**\[6\] Ethereum (Casper) - uses modified BFT consensus**. Blocks will be created using PoW. In the Casper Phase 1 implementation for Ethereum, the “proposal mechanism"" is the existing proof of work chain, modified to have a greatly reduced block reward. Blocks will be validated by set of Validators. Block is finalised when 2/3 of validators voted for it (not the number of validators is counted, but their deposit size). Block creator rewarded with Block Reward + Transaction FEES.

**\[7\] Lisk (Delegated Proof-of-stake)** \- Lisk stakeholders vote with vote transaction (the weight of the vote depends on the amount of Lisk the stakeholder possess) and choose 101 Delegates, who create all blocks in the blockchain. One delegate creates 1 block within 1 round (1 round contains 101 blocks) -&gt; At the beginning of each round, each delegate is assigned a slot indicating their position in the block generation process -&gt; Delegate includes up to 25 transactions into the block, signs it and broadcasts it to the network -&gt; As &gt;51% of available peers agreed that this block is acceptable to be created (Broadhash consensus), a new block is added to the blockchain. \*Any account may become a delegate, but only accounts with the required stake (no info how much) are allowed to generate blocks. Block reward - minted Lisks and transaction fees (fees for all 101 blocks are collected firstly and then are divided between delegates). Blocks appears every 10 sec.

**\[8\] Cardano (Ouroboros Proof of Stake)** \- Blocks(slots) are created by Slot Leaders. Slot Leaders for N Epoch are chosen during n-1 Epoch. Slot Leaders are elected from the group of ADA stakeholders who have enough stake. Election process consist of 3 phases: Commitment phase: each elector generates a random value (secret), signs it and commit as message to network (other electors) saved in to block. -&gt; Reveal phase: Each elector sends special value to open a commitment, all this values (opening) are put into the block. -&gt; Recovery phase: each elector verifies that commitments and openings match and extracts the secrets and forms a SEED (randomly generated bytes string based on secrets). All electors get the same SEED. -&gt; Follow the Satoshi algorithm : Elector who have coin which corresponded to SEED become a SLOT LEADER and get a right to create a block. Slot Leader is rewarded with minted ADA and transactions Fee.

**\[9\] Tezos (Proof Of Stake)** \- generic and self-amending crypto-ledger. At the beginning of each cycle (2048 blocks), a random seed is derived from numbers that block miners chose and committed to in the penultimate cycle, and revealed in the last. -&gt; Using this random seed, a follow the coin strategy (similar to Follow The Satoshi) is used to allocate mining rights and signing rights to stakeholders for the next cycle\*. -&gt; Blocks are mined by a random stakeholder (the miner) and includes multiple signatures of the previous block provided by random stakeholders (the signers). Mining and signing both offer a small reward but also require making a one cycle safety deposit to be forfeited in the event of a double mining or double signing.

· the more coins (rolls) you have - the more your chance to be a miner/signer.

**\[10\] Tendermint (Byzantine Fault Tolerance**) - A proposal is signed and published by the designated proposer at each round. The proposer is chosen by a deterministic and non-choking round robin selection algorithm that selects proposers in proportion to their voting power. The proposer create the block, that should be validated by &gt;2/3 of Validators, as follow: Propose -&gt; Prevote -&gt; Precommit -&gt; Commit. Proposer rewarded with Transaction FEES.

**\[11\] Tron (Byzantine Fault Tolerance**) - This blockhain is still on development stage. Consensus algorithm = PoS + BFT (similar to Tendermint): PoS algorithm chooses a node as Proposer, this node has the power to generate a block. -&gt; Proposer broadcasts a block that it want to release. -&gt; Block enters the Prevote stage. It takes &gt;2/3 of nodes' confirmations to enter the next stage. -&gt; As the block is prevoted, it enters Precommit stage and needs &gt;2/3 of node's confirmation to go further. -&gt; As &gt;2/3 of nodes have precommited the block it's commited to the blockchain with height +1. New blocks appears every 15 sec.

**\[12\] NEO (Delegated Byzantine Fault Tolerance)** \- Consensus nodes\* are elected by NEO holders -&gt; The Speaker is identified (based on algorithm) -&gt; He broadcasts proposal to create block -&gt; Each Delegate (other consensus nodes) validates proposal -&gt; Each Delegate sends response to other Delegates -&gt; Delegate reaches consensus after receiving 2/3 positive responses -&gt; Each Delegate signs the block and publishes it-&gt; Each Delegate receives a full block. Block reward 6 GAS distributed proportionally in accordance with the NEO holding ratio among NEO holders. Speaker rewarded with transaction fees (mostly 0). \* Stake 1000 GAS to nominate yourself for Bookkeeping(Consensus Node)

**\[13\] EOS (Delegated Proof of Stake)** \- those who hold tokens on a blockchain adopting the EOS.IO software may select\* block producers through a continuous approval voting system and anyone may choose to participate in block production and will be given an opportunity to produce blocks proportional to the total votes they have received relative to all other producers. At the start of each round 21 unique block producers are chosen. The top 20 by total approval are automatically chosen every round and the last producer is chosen proportional to their number of votes relative to other producers. Block should be confirmed by 2/3 or more of elected Block producers. Block Producer rewarded with Block rewards. \*the more EOS tokens a stakeholder owns, the greater their voting power

**\[The XRP Ledger Consensus Process\]**

**\[14\] Ripple - Each node receives transaction from external applications** \-&gt; Each Node forms public list of all valid (not included into last ledger (=block)) transactions aka (Candidate Set) -&gt; Nodes merge its candidate set with UNLs(Unique Node List) candidate sets and vote on the veracity of all transactions (1st round of consensus) -&gt; all transactions that received at least 50% votes are passed on the next round (many rounds may take place) -&gt; final round of consensus requires that min 80% of Nodes UNL agreeing on transactions. It means that at least 80% of Validating nodes should have same Candidate SET of transactions -&gt; after that each Validating node computes a new ledger (=block) with all transactions (with 80% UNL agreement) and calculate ledger hash, signs and broadcasts -&gt; All Validating nodes compare their ledgers hash -&gt; Nodes of the network recognize a ledger instance as validated when a 80% of the peers have signed and broadcast the same validation hash. -&gt; Process repeats. Ledger creation process lasts 5 sec(?). Each transaction includes transaction fee (min 0,00001 XRP) which is destroyed. No block rewards.

**\[The Stellar consensus protocol\]**

**\[15\] Stellar (Federated Byzantine Agreement)** \- quite similar to Ripple. Key difference - quorum slice.

**\[Proof of Burn\]**

\[16\] Slimcoin - to get the right to write blocks Node should “burn” amount of coins. The more coins Node “burns” more chances it has to create blocks (for long period) -&gt; Nodes address gets a score called Effective Burnt Coins that determines chance to find blocks. Block creator rewarded with block rewards.

**\[Proof of Importance\]**

\[17\] NEM - Only accounts that have min 10k vested coins are eligible to harvest (create a block). Accounts with higher importance scores have higher probabilities of harvesting a block. The higher amount of vested coins, the higher the account’s Importance score. And the higher amount of transactions that satisfy following conditions: - transactions sum min 1k coins, - transactions made within last 30 days, - recipient have 10k vested coins too, - the higher account’s Important score. Harvester is rewarded with fees for the transactions in the block. A new block is created approx. every 65 sec.

**\[Proof of Devotion\]**

\[18\] Nebulas (Proof of Devotion + BFT) - quite similar to POI, the PoD selects the accounts with high influence. All accounts are ranked according to their liquidity and propagation (Nebulas Rank) -&gt; Top-ranked accounts are selected -&gt; Chosen accounts pay deposit and are qualified as the blocks Validators\* -&gt; Algorithm pseudo-randomly chooses block Proposer -&gt; After a new block is proposed, Validators Set (each Validator is charged a deposit) participate in a round of BFT-Style voting to verify block (1. Prepare stage -&gt; 2. Commit Stage. Validators should have &gt; 2/3 of total deposits to validate Block) -&gt; Block is added. Block rewards : each Validator rewarded with 1 NAS. \*Validators Set is dynamic, changes in Set may occur after Epoch change.

**\[IOTA Algorithm\]**

\[19\] IOTA - uses DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) instead of blockchain (TANGLE equal to Ledger). Graph consist of transactions (not blocks). To issue a new transaction Node must approve 2 random other Transactions (not confirmed). Each transaction should be validate n(?) times. By validating PAST(2) transactions whole Network achieves Consensus. in Order to issue transaction Node: 1. Sign transaction with private key 2. choose two other Transactions to validate based on MCMC(Markov chain Monte Carlo) algorithm, check if 2 transactions are valid (node will never approve conflicting transactions) 3. make some PoW(similar to HashCash). -&gt; New Transaction broadcasted to Network. Node don’t receive reward or fee.

**\[PBFT + PoW\]**

\[20\] Yobicash - uses PBFT and also PoW. Nodes reach consensus on transactions by querying other nodes. A node asks its peers about the state of a transaction: if it is known or not, and if it is a doublespending transaction or not. As follow : Node receives new transaction -&gt; Checks if valid -&gt; queries all known nodes for missing transactions (check if already in DAG ) -&gt; queries 2/3 nodes for doublepsending and possibility -&gt; if everything is ok add to DAG. Reward - nodes receive transaction fees + minting coins.

**\[Proof of Space/Proof of Capacity\]**

\[21\] Filecoin (Power Fault Tolerance) - the probability that the network elects a miner(Leader) to create a new block (it is referred to as the voting power of the miner) is proportional to storage currently in use in relation to the rest of the network. Each node has Power - storage in use verified with Proof of Spacetime by nodes. Leaders extend the chain by creating a block and propagating it to the network. There can be an empty block (when no leader). A block is committed if the majority of the participants add their weight on the chain where the block belongs to, by extending the chain or by signing blocks. Block creator rewarded with Block reward + transaction fees.

**\[Proof of Elapsed Time (POET)\]**

\[22\] Hyperledger Sawtooth - Goal - to solve BFT Validating Nodes limitation. Works only with intel’s SGX. PoET uses a random leader election model or a lottery based election model based on SGX, where the protocol randomly selects the next leader to finalize the block. Every validator requests a wait time from an enclave (a trusted function). -&gt; The validator with the shortest wait time for a particular transaction block is elected the leader. -&gt; The BlockPublisher is responsible for creating candidate blocks to extend the current chain. He takes direction from the consensus algorithm for when to create a block and when to publish a block. He creates, Finalizes, Signs Block and broadcast it -&gt; Block Validators check block -&gt; Block is created on top of blockchain.

**\[23\] Byteball (Delegated Byzantine Fault Tolerance)** \- only verified nodes are allowed to be Validation nodes (list of requirements [https://github.com/byteball/byteball-witness](https://github.com/byteball/byteball-witness)). Users choose in transaction set of 12 Validating nodes. Validating nodes(Witnesses) receive transaction fees.

**\[24\] Nano - uses DAG, PoW (HashCash).** Nano uses a block-lattice structure. Each account has its own blockchain (account-chain) equivalent to the account’s transaction/balance history. To add transaction user should make some HashCash PoW -&gt; When user creates transaction Send Block appears on his blockchain and Receive block appears on Recipients blockchain. -&gt; Peers in View receive Block -&gt; Peers verify block (Double spending and check if already in the ledger) -&gt; Peers achieve consensus and add block. In case of Fork (when 2 or more signed blocks reference the same previous block): Nano network resolves forks via a balance-weighted voting system where representative nodes vote for the block they observe, as &gt;50% of weighted votes received, consensus achieved and block is retained in the Node’s ledger (block that lose the vote is discarded).

**\[25\] Holochain - uses distributed hash table (DHT).** Instead of trying to manage global consensus for every change to a huge blockchain ledger, every participant has their own signed hash chain. In case of multi-party transaction, it is signed to each party's chain. Each party signs the exact same transaction with links to each of their previous chain entries. After data is signed to local chains, it is shared to a DHT where every neighbor node validate it. Any consensus algorithms can be built on top of Holochain.

**\[26\] Komodo ('Delegated' Delayed Proof of Work (dPoW**)) - end-to-end blockchain solutions. DPoW consensus mechanism does not recognize The Longest Chain Rule to resolve a conflict in the network, instead the dPoW looks to backups it inserted previously into the chosen PoW blockchain. The process of inserting backups of Komodo transactions into a secure PoW is “notarization.” Notarisation is performed by the elected Notary nodes. Roughly every ten minutes, the Notary nodes perform a special block hash mined on the Komodo blockchain and take note of the overall Komodo blockchain “height”. The notary nodes process this specifc block so that their signatures are cryptographically included within the content of the notarized data. There are sixty-four “Notary nodes” elected by a stake-weighted vote, where ownership of KMD represents stake in the election. They are a special type of blockchain miner, having certain features in their underlying code that enable them to maintain an effective and cost-efcient blockchain and they periodically receives the privilege to mine a block on “easy difculty.”

personalfinance,Retirement savings/long term investments for self employed,"I will keep this as short as I can...

\-22 and self employed. I own an LLC with a few seasonal/part time guys. 

\-I have a rental property bringing in $1550/mo with $60,000 left on the mortgage, just reappraised at $85,000. I purchased last year. 

\-Currently closing on my main home which will have a $150,000 mortgage (home is worth $220,000).

\-Between my fiancee and I we have about a $8,000 emergency savings acct at .09%

\-I make around $40,000 not including rental income. (I take a low salary to reinvest in my business I have no kids or large expenses so I don't need a high salary.)

\-Around $1,000 invested in REIT's through Meryl Edge

\-&gt;$2,000 in federally subsidized student loans 

\-$8,000 left on car @ 2.9%. (Driving a beater isn't an option when we get 100+ inches of snow)

\-By 2022 we expect to have kids(we want 4), so I would take a 20%-30% salary increase continuing at 6% increase until I reach $65,000/yr  

Here are my thoughts any input would be appreciated

Investing in a few Index Funds(I have no idea how it works tbh)

Continue to add to emergency fund/savings at a rate of $200/mo. Anything over $10,000 invest.

Payoff rental building and acquire another one. 

Are 401k's a thing for self employed? I'm taking on a full time guy soon and I wouldn't mind setting one up for him as well with a some employer contribution. 

I have no plans to retire. I'm eventually going to work 4 day weeks but in 30 years I'll either pass things on to one of my kids, sell it, or just die doing what I love. 

Do I have any options for life insurance? 

Like I said, any suggestions would be appreciated.",finance

btc,Script from the Kaiser report yesterday with Saifedean Ammous (Author:The Bitcoin Standard),"See the interview here - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxdOb44KXmI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxdOb44KXmI)

**Max Keiser: (12:13)** 

The use case for Bitcoin is What? and one of the things that is very important to understand is that this is money that can be controlled completely outside of government and that's a huge break in the history of money and is vastly important, can you just speak on that to begin with. 

**Saifedean: (12:33)**

I think a common problem that people have with Bitcoin, as somebody put it to me is that Bitcoin has been mis-evangelized, people have marketed **Bitcoin as a cheaper better Paypal** or a **cheaper better VISA or Mastercard** and I think that is a **complete category error**. It is completely missing the point of what Bitcoin is and why Bitcoin is important. 

**Bitcoin is not meant to be a consumer payment network** 

**Bitcoin will have consumer payment networks installed ontop of it** , Bitcoin is more like a reserve asset or more like **Base money that is used for the settlement of consumer payments**.

WTF???

Are authors these days completely oblivious of the [Bitcoin whitepaper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf) before they write books???

personalfinance,Probably a noob question but here goes....,"Good morning all. I am needing some advice. I currently have a truck loan @2.99% with a $112/weekly payment.

personalfinance,First time opening a High-Yield Savings account.,"Hello!

personalfinance,Withdrawing from inheritance IRA to pay off student loans,"Hello all,

I hope I can get some better understanding. Around 8 years ago a parent of mine passed away and I inherited an IRA.  It’s set up so I have a yearly required minimum distribution I need to take based on life expectancy tables. 

I have roughly $35k in student loans that I will need to start paying in June of 2019.  I know there are some penalties associated with taking more than the RMD from the beneficiary IRA, but does that cost outweigh paying interest towards the student loans?  I believe the average interest rate on those loans is around 4.5%.  The IRA balance is a bit above $200k.

personalfinance,Grandma Left me a Rental Property,"When I was 18 years old, my grandmother passed away. She left myself, my dad, my uncle, and three of my cousins houses in my hometown about 30 miles from Columbus, OH. She was a realtor, and purchased homes she thought were good values and kept them as rental properties to support herself in her retirement. She was a very smart, and thoughtful lady. 

I am now 22, still own the house, and have started my first job, in Columbus, OH. My parents still leave near the house, in my hometown. It is currently occupied with a renter who pays $725 a month in rent. He consistently does pay late, but is polite, keeps the place in great condition, and is never more than 2 weeks late, so I tolerate it. I am fairly certain if I raised the rent he would have to find another place, but I think I could probably get close to $850 out of it, as the real estate market is growing in my town. 

The issue I’m running into, is that now that I’ve started my job, I’m finding myself in a considerably higher tax bracket, and the net return on the property is shrinking. My marginal rate is 22% at the federal level, 3.5% state, and 2.5% city- 28% total on income. Property taxes are almost $1100 a year, and insurance is $630. If repairs are needed, this just exacerbates this point. 

Revenue: 12 months x $725 =$8,700/year
Costs (laid out above): $4,166/year
Income: $4,534

My question to you all is: should I look to sell this property? There is a small university campus nearby that at one time was interested in putting a road through where my house is, so I had been waiting for that, as I imagine they would be the highest paying buyer. That being said, it seems their interest has waned, and it may not be years, if ever that they’d want to purchase it. 

Otherwise, Zillow has valued the property at $96,649. If I could get that for it, I’d sell it tomorrow. Given I am still young, I’d be able to take the money and let it work in the market for 30 years or so, which could provide great return. At what price would you all consider selling the property?

 I’d be happy to provide additional info if there is anything that may help with suggestions. Also: thanks for any help, I’ll read and respond to as many questions as I can!",finance
personalfinance,Student loan discrepancy -- should I hire a financial advisor?,"Hello! 
*correction to title of post — accountant, not planner*

When investigating my educational loans, I notice a large increase (not related to interest) on one loan that changed lenders. I confirmed with the school I was attending and checked my bank statements from that time, and I don't see where this new increase of over $10k came from. I had a financial planner (at no cost, who wasn't very knowledgable on the matter) check it over on my account, and he said to contact FedLoan. ([myfedloan.org](https://myfedloan.org)) They weren't much help either.

Should I hire an accountant who may have more insight into what to do in this matter? Basically I believe I am being over-charged a great deal, and I don't know how to confirm this.

personalfinance,"(CAN) 28 years old, not sure I'm doing things right. Any advice would be great!","I'm a 28-year-old female. I'm currently a tenure track professor at a good University (I've been working there for a year). My wife is 25 and finishing her degree in entomology. I'm going to provide financial information and I want to know if I'm doing ok and what I can do better. If any information is missing please don't hesitate to ask.

My current salary: $63,000 per year &lt;-- live in a small area so this is pretty good for where we live.

Wife's current salary: ~$10,000 per year (while finishing school)

My salary goes up each semester until it hits $87,000. If I want to go beyond that, I need to get a promotion.

We have no children and we have no desire to have them. 

Here is our current debt:

Mortgage: $128,000 at 2.5% interest rate fixed for 5 years.

Miscellaneous debt (consolidated): $9,500 at 12% interest. We are paying double the minimum monthly payments to get it paid off sooner.


Both of our cars are paid for and we do not count my student loans because they were taken out in the USA and due to the foreign income exclusion the US government regards my CAD earnings as $0 which means I don't pay my student loans. They will eventually be forgiven although I will pay a hefty sum in taxes the year they are forgiven. 

Now as for monthly expenditures:

Mortgage + property tax: $700 

Groceries: ~$500

Property Insurance: $100

Electric/water/sewer: $200

Car Insurance: $120

Miscellaneous: $250 

So, when we bought the house and moved (after all expenses) we only had about $2,000 in the bank. That was seven months ago. Now we have about $10,500 in the bank in Canada and approximately $2,000 in the USA. 

Questions:

1. Should we invest? A friend of mine with an MA in finances said it would be wise to invest about 5K in a moderate risk portfolio. Stocks and investments terrify me because it seems like such a big unstable risk. Is it worth it? 

2. I feel like $10,500 isn't a lot of money. Should we cut down on something like groceries? We love food so we have a hard time not spending a lot on groceries. We try not to eat out as much as we used to. What are some money-saving tips you can recommend?

3. I have a retirement fund with the University and government health care including prescription, dental, and eye coverage so I'm not worried about those things. I just want to make sure that we will have a stable and comfortable life. I worry that, at 28, I'm not as financially advanced as I should be.

personalfinance,HELOC instead of Student Loans?,"Hey guys sorry for the lengthy post, but I'm trying to figure out the best way to handle my upcoming financial obligations and am unsure of how to proceed.

The situation:

I've decided to go back to school (classes start in 2 weeks) for a career change. I currently work for a family business (father is the owner) and plan to continue working full time until I finish school. I'll be attending a vocational program at a local community college. My wife also works full time

Our house also needs a new roof, badly. That is scheduled to happen in late September/early October. I've currently got all the leaks fixed (with probably more tar than should be on any 1 roof) but that's a temporary fix.

Finances:

-Cash: $14k

-House Remaining Mortgage/Value: 150k/~220k

-Monthly budget surplus: $500 (could be more if I dial back retirement contributions while in school, and once I start co-ops I'll have some more income)


Upcoming costs:

-School tuition: $1800/semester

-Tools for school: $4500 (1 time, can use student loans)

-Roof: $9k-10k depending on how much plywood needs to be repaced

Interest rates:

-Student loans: 5%
-HELOC: 4.75%


So my conundrum is we fall short of being able to pay for all of this out of pocket, and I don't want to completely drain all of our cash anyway.

As far as I can tell the biggest advantage to student loans is not having to start repayment until after graduating. Since I can start repayment right away does it make sense to use a HELOC that I can use to manage cashflow for the next few years and ideally have almost nothing left to pay off by the time I finish school?

If there's another angle to approach this from that I haven't listed here I'm open to all suggestions. Thanks!",finance

* 50% payout for surviving spouse with a 10% penalty.

personalfinance,Drowning in debt not sure what to do?,"There is always a feeling of dread when you have fallen on financial hardship coupled the sour twisted feeling you get in your guts when you can see letters poking out of your letter box only to think to yourself
'""what could it possibly be that I owe money to now?""

Well I had one of those horrible, shocking days wherein I opened a letter expecting some small overdue bill, only to be slapped with a $13,200 debt from the government.

Now to give you a little insight into what I can only describe to be ""my fucked situation"" (first off im in Australia so laws my be different to the rest of the world)

The past 5 years I have been paying off a Part IX  Debt agreement, which for those of you who don't know, is an agreement you make with the government through a company to have all of your current debt consolidated the company negotiates with your creditors and the interest frozen for a period of 5 years and your marked as insolvent (1 step before bankruptcy) until this is paid off, which means essentially I can't get a loan, a phone contract or any other form of credit.

When I was 19 (now 26) I bought a car from a dodgy dealer and essentially ended up with a lemon and a $28,000 debt. I stopped repaying the loan and went through court and a bunch of other pain which is not really relevant but essentially I ended up with no car and a massive debt. Due to the loss of my vehicle and court costs, I was fired for having days off to sort the car out or go to court and was seen as 'too unreliable'

I also had a couple of credit cards at the time and a personal loan. My debt totalled around $32,000.

So with no job and no hope, and after months of looking for work and moving back with my parents, my hand was forced into the part IX or I would face going to court once again over the debts. 

At this time I decided I would go and study double diplomas in business and management so I could try and improve my chances if getting work while living with my family. I was getting study payments from the government and working casually, now for those of you who, again, are unaware of how it works in Australia, everyones entitled to study allowance if your studying and we also have a social security if your not working but its a lot of hassle and not really worth the money at the end of the day. 

Anyway, you can work on these allowances but if you earn over a certain amount of money, your not entitled and they cut your payment for that fortnight, either reducing it or by paying you nothing. Depending on your earnings fortnightly from work, which you need to report to them online.

So I was working casually while studying and collecting a study payment and reporting my earnings which was under the threshold of not being 'cut off' as it were.

Once I finished my study for one week I would work one week and then study for one week and so on. As it was online study and it was flexible. 

I finished my studys in roughly 15 months which was meant to take 2 years because I worked ahead, then I went into full time work.

Now fast forward to the present, I have been working my ass off to pay off the $32000 debt I had which was essentially for a car I never had and nothing to show for it, I think I have one tv cabinet.....thats an expensive cabinet.
As of today my balance is $2850. 
I was so close to being freed I could smell it, 

Annnnd. 13k debt. 

So the government is slapping everyone for these bills based on their tax returns due to the fact they are taking the annual income figure for the year and dividing it by 26 to get a fortnightly figure, and whether or not you worked that fortnight and your reported earnings were $0, your provisional earnings would be more than the allowed threshold before they cut off your study payments/unemployment allowance.

They are saying that I had under reported my earnings which is not true. Saying I reported 1/4 of what I earned, but I earned it after I had finished studying.

So now they are saying I need to provide bank statements from 7 years ago to prove WHEN I had the money, but the banks in Australia only have to keep your records for 5 years and they want payslips from each of the companies I worked for back 7 years ago for proof too, which a couple don't exist anymore. So now im essentially fucked and am liable for this debt. 

To make matters worse, I lost my full time job a month ago ad have only been able to pick up casual work (20 hrs a week barely) and the new job is 40 mins drive away so for 3 hour shifts its not really worth going. Im struggling to pay rent and bills as it is and they want $13,200 in 3 weeks.

As it stands im already $12,000 in debt for my current car I bought with a loan from the part IX company I went through at a high interest rate (16.5%) which in retrospect was stupid but I needed a vehicle stat so I could get to work, and I waited 5 years to get a loan so it was almost a reward to myself for paying most of my debt off.
The cars is worth maybe $8000 if I sell it now If im lucky.

I owe around just under $3000 to my part IX and once thats paid I should have some minor credit rating again - but barely.

I'm just not sure what to do, I was recently planning on travelling around Australia with my girlfriend which we would both need around 10k for, but that seems to be pretty much out the window now. :(
I have $0 savings due to being recently unemployed for 30 days. I was due a $3800 tax return which I was going to use to knock off the last of my debt agreement but it looks like they will take that now being that they can.
Feeling a bit hopeless, spent the day drinking my sorrows away now I need some advice I guess. 

TLDR: government say I owe them 13k from under reporting earnings while studying based on my tax returns from 7 years ago. Spent 5 years paying off 32k personal debt only to be slapped with more, facing current financial hardship.",finance

personalfinance,Found out my girlfriend is pregnant: next moves?,"Currently making approximately 75k a year and should make near 95k within 5 years.  I have about 3k in student loan debt, but it has a very low interest rate of about 3%.  I have approximately 5k in my bank accounts with another 10k in stocks.

Girlfriend just graduated college with a Biology (Microbiology) degree and is currently looking for work.  She spent most of her money to pay for college and her vehicle, so she does not have much in terms of savings.

When I receive my next raise within a couple months, I will not be eligible for City assistance which would provide a \~55K silent loan that does not require repayment before 30 years or if we sell the house before 30 years.  Given that the brand new home is approximately 375k, I would need to add about 20k to the 55k to meet the 20% down payment to avoid PMI. 

The housing market in CA seems to be at a very high point in terms of price.  There seems to be a lot of talk that a market correction is due to occur within the next couple years.  I’ve been keeping my eye on the market and it seems that more and more homes are becoming available and they have longer listing times compared to last year.

We just recently found out that she is pregnant.  I’m estimating approximately 3-5 weeks.  We made an appointment to see the doctor next week.  Our current living situation is renting a 1BR within a 4-plex.  Our neighbors are great, but I cannot imaging us with a newborn and living with young single professionals, especially with thin walls/floors.  Also, we are in the “midtown” of the City, so it gets a bit noisy on weekends.

What would you guys do in this situation?  Would it be best to rent a home in a quieter area until we get financially stable or should I pull the trigger on the new home where the City would provide assistance?  My only issue with this is that I would basically blow my rainy day/investment money on a home.  Also, once we have dual incomes and decide to move out, we would have to pay the \~55k back.  I have not looked into the repayment details yet.

Edit: thanks for the info guys. I think we'll just rent a home in the meantime. The 55k silent loan just sounds so good, but I know we'll be able to afford something much nicer in the next few years.",finance

This would leave $8,400 which is not enough. My uncle was asking me if their was anyway to get the full amount as he needs it to do the heating on his home before winter comes this year.

Is dipping into a 401k a good idea? Will the 20% which is $2100 be returned on his taxes or refunded back some other way or is it just gone? Is there any other course of action that would be correct in this matter? He needs roughly $16,500 to do the heating in his home he's told me. With his other savings of about $3000 his plan was to use paid vacation days from his job and focus on his side job of landscaping which he only does on the weekends usually to make more money.

personalfinance,Need advice determining how to pay down a combination of student loans.,"This is a rather simple question, but I have about $60,000 in Student loans and I am on a graduated repayment plan. Currently nearing the first increase to my monthly payment, I am wondering how I should be dividing up my second monthly payment.

I currently pay $370/mo, and pay a second $370/mo towards three of my high interest loans, instead of just double paying across all my loans. I'm wondering if instead I should be focusing the full extra $370 payment into one high interest loan at a time, and then if I should be working from either most to least, or least to most. I have three federal loans with 6.8% Interest at the rough values of $7,000, $3,500, and $2,200. Not sure if it'd make sense to try and chip away at the $7,000 loan before the other two, or work my way up. I was just think trying to chip at them together may actually not be saving me as much money in the end compared to focusing on one at a time, but I am not sure. All my other loans sit between 4.8% and 3% Interest.

Looking at the AutoMod suggestions seems like Chipping at the 7k, then moving to the 3k once the 7k balance drops below the 3k, seems better in terms of money saved at the end of the day?",finance
personalfinance,Advice for new college students taking on student loans?,"I will be starting college in a few weeks and after seeing the numbers I'm starting to get stressed about how to deal with the loan debt I will be taking on. I wouldn't say that I'm in bad financial health or bad with my money but I still need advice on how to move forward.

Here's a little bit of background on my situation:

I've been working the last two years at a grocery store making minimum wage ($10.10 here in CT). Worked a decent number of hours but wildly inconsistent anywhere from 15 to 30 hours a week. Tried to save as much as I could and when I graduated high school I had about $10k in a savings account. I felt pretty good about it as that's a fair amount of money for 18 years old, but still nowhere near enough to pay for my education.

I didn't want to drown myself in student loan debt so I made the smart decision to commute to school rather than live on campus. I'm only about 20 minutes from school so it's not too bad. Several of my friends who live near me are living on campus but I can't justify spending an extra $14k per year to live less than half an hour from my house. Personally I think it's an unnecessary expense.

Over the summer I reluctantly spent most of my savings. I bought my own car for about $5500. I know many on here may think that's crazy but I did not want to buy a dirt cheap beater car because I needed something reliable that would last me four years. If my car suddenly died or was in the shop for an extended period of time I would have major issues as it is my only form of transportation to school. I then spent about $1500 on school supplies (books, laptop, etc.). Left myself with about $3000 for my actual education.

College is going to cost me about $16k per year (vs. about $30k/yr if I lived on campus). Just under $8k per semester. For the first semester I put $2000 of my savings towards the fee bill and my parents gave me $2300, so I had about $4300 paid for and another $3700 left to pay. Federal student loans covered $2700 of it and the rest I had to take out a private loan. Just from the first semester alone I'm already $6k in debt. What scares me is next semester when I won't have my parent's help (they give me $2300 for the whole school year). In a few months I will have another $8k due and as of right now there is only $1000 in my savings account.

I was lucky enough to get a job on campus, but it's only about 17hrs/wk so I'm looking at roughly $130/wk or $520 in monthly income. My biggest expenses right now are car insurance ($135/month) and gas money ($120/month). That's about $225 each month left over. Even if I put that entire amount into savings, which is unrealistic, I'll have $3375 saved over the course of a 15 week semester. $3375 + $1000 in savings right now = $4375 but that's only if I spend $0 on anything else which will not happen. So likely less than $4k facing another $8k tuition bill.

Obviously income and expenses will change slightly over the course of four years, but if I base it off of the first semester ($6k in loans), I'll graduate roughly $48,000 in debt. On the bright side it's not as bad as other people facing six-figure student loan debt, but still a lot of money that I do not have right now.

I try to remind myself that the education will be worth it in the long run. $48k looks insurmountable right now but once I have my first real job things should get much better. I will be getting my degree in computer science and projected starting salary is $60k, plus there's a ton of jobs in that field. Hopefully I will be in a good position once I graduate.

What kills me is seeing the terms of a 10-year loan. I will graduate in 2022 which means I will finish paying off my debt when I am 32 YEARS OLD! I want to have it paid off much sooner than that if possible. Within 3 years of graduating if that is realistic.

Basically, Reddit, student loans are stressing me out and I need solid financial advice on how to handle my money and get through the ""broke college student"" phase. Thanks :)",finance

worldpolitics,"Iraq: how traitorous dual citizenship Israel-firsters, America second in the US sway the country toward pursuing Israeli strategic interests as opposed to American ones","Testament to how subverted and compromised the 'anti-war' Left is in the US is the 'no wars for oil!' slogan that was born after the US invaded Iraq in 2003. Easy to assume, after all, is the apparent fact that the only reason the US would invade a Middle Eastern state would be to get its oil. That's apparently all the Middle Eastern states have and the string of other factors that went into shaping the conditions for a US invasion of Iraq goes completely ignored. History can't be ignored, whether it's from yesterday or a decade ago. That this is all information available in the public domain just makes it even worse.

Just a short dismissal of the 'war for oil' explanation, although it'll become apparent enough gradually in the course of the post; China was the main benefactor of the boom in Iraqi oil-production following the US invasion with former Bush administration Defense Department (DoD) official Michael Makovsky saying that US ships and other security measures had ended up merely protecting China's access to the Iraqi oil. The US didn't invade Iraq to ban others from getting its oil and Iraqi oil continued to be sold on the world market just as countries like Iraq and Iran would gladly have done if not for sanctions. Iraq, during its years under the horrid and criminal sanctions imposed on it during the 90s up till 2002, had already been doling out its oil on the international market in exchange for pitiful amounts of food aid as part of the UN's Oil for Food Programme. 576 000 children would starve to death during the course of this programme, and Iraq would continue to be preyed upon for its oil. Pretty good deal right there, and no need for an expensive invasion and ensuing quagmire whereby an anti-Iranian Arab dictator with a history of literally working with the US (Iran-Iraq War) is removed and pro-Iranian anti-Saddam elements empowered. So who wanted Saddam gone? 

The answer lies in Israel, and the workings and profiles of the Bush administration DoD post-2001 with regard to Iraq highlight very well that a certain section of the US govermment and media spectrum was working relentlessly to secure what had been a decades-old Israeli Likud policy of destabilizing Iraq and removing a major military adversary of Iraql.

From page 15 onwards in this rather large FBI document obtained by irmep.org's Grant F Smith (it's not secret information that required an FOIA lawsuit but it's a massive document and I like using it) is the full, in-depth description of how the neoconservatives - a mostly Jewish clique of former Communist turned right-wing Republican war hawks and ardent Zionists - rose to prominent positions in the DoD in larger numbers than ever before and produced the false intel on Iraqi chemical weapons, ties to Al Qaeda and so on to give us the eventual 2003 Iraq War. Characteristic of their methods involved setting up new intel-gathering offices to cherry-pick rumours from personally picked out sources (like the famous Iraqi exile and neocon affiliate Ahmed Chalabi who'd later turn into an Iranian spy) and ensure they found the ear of the president himself via their neocon comrades in the White House as well as in the State Department. The 'mobile chemical weapons labs under Saddam's palace', the 'yellowcake uranium purchased by Iraq from Niger' (falsified document complete with the forged signature of a retired Nigerian foreign ministry official) and similar myths came not from the traditional intelligence community in the DoD comprising the CIA and other agencies, but from the Office of Special Plans and similar other fraudulent intelligence-gathering offices prime neocons in the DoD set up. In fact, the purging of non-neocon, regular career officials from the DoD and ignoring of the CIA was a prime tactic used by the neocons, of which the most notorious were probably Paul Wolfowitz (deputy Secretary of Defense) and Douglas Feith (Undersecretary of Defense for policy) who set up the new offices in pre-existing sections of the DoD and began bringing in fellow neocon affiliates and Israel-enthusiasts like David Wurmser and William J Luti to run their fraudulent intel-gathering units.

Saddam Hussein and Iraq, while it's become clear by now remaining a potential partner for the US and highly leverage-able state given the immense damage it took during the 80s and 90s to its infrastructure, economy and society, were Israeli targets since the mid-1970s and had been continuously attacked by Zionist-centric media outlets, think tanks, lobbyists and activists throughout that period who'd go on and form the neocon clique. 

Just to demonstrate that Zionism and close ties to Israel's government and strategic circles were the defining aspect of this mostly-Jewish clique of neoconservatives, a little background info is in order. That their oft-repeated claims of Israeli and US security objectives being joint at the hip are cover for their status as de facto foreign agents and that they push for strategic, geopolitical policies of a purely Israeli origin shall be established as a point of secondary importance throughout this.

A LITTLE LOOK AT HISTORY AND THE NEOCON ROLE IN IT:

Paul Wolfowitz, one of the best known and most experienced neocons, has family in Israel and is well acquainted with Israeli government officials as being one of the best-known figures of the 'Jewish right-wing', as Haaretz puts it. This seems to be a common feature among neoconservatives and he himself offers a fine example of an industrious career as one. He's also known as one of the main architects of the Iraq War. Of immense significance, however, is also his acting as a de-facto representative for Israeli strategic interests whilst he worked in the US government even prior to his stint under Bush Jr. Secret memos like this highlighted the Israeli perspective in the Iran Contra Affair and this as an example. Seeking 'approval' for Israel to act as a third-party supplier of weapons to Iran to use against Iraq (which the US was openly backing during the war) were the work of Wolfowitz and other neocons despite the outrage the American public would've had were it been made public at the time that the country that'd taken hostage Americans at the Tehran US Embassy for more than a year was being given arms in exchange for its release of those hostages. The Israeli interest in all of this was facilitated by key neocons like Wolfowitz in the DoD in the Reagan administration who cared more about what the violent, fascistic Menachim Begin of Israel wanted to achieve by inserting Israel into the Iran-Iraq-US mess. That this would break out into a huge scandal toward the mid 1980s showed it was a specific, Zionist, neocon faction of the US government which followed Israeli goals even when they interfered directly with the official US policy which carefully took into account things Israel didn't care all that much about. From 'The US-Israel-Iran Triangle's Tangled History' by the late and great Robert Parry, who first broke the story of the entire Contras Affair (involving more than just Iran but the Nicaraguan part isn't that heavily linked to Iraq so I'll leave it out, I already need to make a turn back to Iraq-centric stuff here):

Determined to help Iran counter Iraq and hopeful about rebuilding at least covert ties to Tehran, Begin’s government cleared the first small shipments of U.S. military supplies to Iran in spring 1980, including 300 tires for Iran’s U.S.-manufactured jet fighters. Soon, Carter learned about the covert shipments and lodged an angry complaint.

Risking pissing off the White House and other government institutions to facilitate Menachem Begin of Israel. Unsurprising, considering Wolfowitz was a neocon and basically an Israeli agent following an anti-Saddam line as opposed to the anti-Iran line that the US government had on the surface.

Begin also was upset at Carter’s perceived failure to protect the Shah of Iran, who had been an Israeli strategic ally. Begin was worried, too, about the growing influence of Saddam Hussein’s Iraq as it massed troops along the Iranian border

More neoconservative pro Israel hawks in the US that the Israelis continued using as their entrypoint into manipulating US policy actively included Robert McFarlane and Michael Ledeen.

According to this analysis, Labor’s desire to open its own arms channel to Iran laid the groundwork for the Iran-Contra scandal, as the government of Prime Minister Shimon Peres tapped into the emerging neoconservative network inside the Reagan administration on one hand and began making his own contacts to Iran’s leadership on the other. Reagan’s National Security Adviser Robert McFarlane, who had close ties to the Israeli leadership, collaborated with Peres’s aide Amiram Nir and with neocon intellectual (and National Security Council consultant) Michael Ledeen in spring 1985 to make contact with the Iranians.

Begin (followed by Peres), being like most Israeli leaders geared toward seeking hegemony, expansion and considering even returning territory annexed through wars of aggression from other countries to be 'bending over', wanted basically to neutralize Iraq as Iraq under Saddam had been an Arab nationalist state. Whatever his flaws, and he had many moral flaws, Saddam was anti-Israel while being 'pragmatic' and fairly multipolar vis-a-vis his relations with the US and its rival the USSR. Which meant, to a neocon like Wolfowitz, that Israel had to be given first priority and thus Saddam removed. The Peres government didn't particularly care for America's views on Iran, either.

Wolfowitz and his fellow neocons also vehemently condemned George HW Bush's refusal to actually take out Saddam Hussein himself when the US attacked Iraq following a huge media circus arranged by Tom Lantos when he orchestrated the now-famous Fake Nayirah Testimony which claimed Iraqi crimes against humanity in Kuwait. Tom Lantos, a Congressman who the Sibel Edmonds testimony revealed to be a spy for Israel alongwith Wolfowitz in the late 90s/early 2000s, was an enthusiastic Zionist and had obvious interest in railroading the US into War in Iraq. The neocons let their frustrations at Bush not having taken Baghdad and removed Saddam be known in a famous 1998 document called Project for the New American Century.

As information about PNAC made its way slowly into the mainstream media, ABC Nightline’s Ted Koppel could no longer avoid it. On March 5th, he told his audience, that “Back in 1997, a group of Washington heavyweights, almost all of them neo-conservatives, formed an organization called the Project for the New American Century. In an article titled 'A War for Israel' written by former photographer-journalist Jeff Blankfort (famous as the only man to sue the ADL and win, in a case where they spied on him decades ago):

Then in September of 2002, during the buildup to the invasion, the Glasgow Sunday Herald reported that it had discovered “A secret blueprint for U.S. global domination [which] reveals that President Bush and his cabinet were planning a premeditated attack on Iraq to secure regime change even before he took power in January 2001.”75 What it was describing was the Project for a New American Century (PNAC), and it even had a web site which spelled out its plans until they were subsequently removed. That it was discovered by a Scottish newspaper was another telling commentary on the state of American journalism.

Founded in June of 1997, following the Clean Break by a year, part of PNAC’s plan was for the U.S. to take control of the Gulf region with overwhelming and deadly military force. “While the unresolved conflict with Iraq provides the immediate justification,” the PNAC document explains, ”the need for a substantial American force-presence in the Gulf transcends the issue of the regime of Saddam Hussein.” (My emphasis) 76

Continuing: 

As information about PNAC made its way slowly into the mainstream media, ABC Nightline’s Ted Koppel could no longer avoid it. On March 5th, he told his audience, that “Back in 1997, a group of Washington heavyweights, almost all of them neo-conservatives, formed an organization called the Project for the New American Century. They did what former government officials and politicians frequently do when they’re out of power, they began formulating a strategy, in this case, a foreign policy strategy, that might bring influence to bear on the administration then in power, headed by President Clinton. Or failing that, on a new administration that might someday come to power. They were pushing for the elimination of Saddam Hussein. And proposing the establishment of a strong U.S. military presence in the Persian Gulf, linked to a willingness to use force to protect vital American interests in the Gulf. All of that might be of purely academic interest were it not for the fact that among the men behind that campaign were such names as, Dick Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld, and Paul Wolfowitz. What was, back in 1997, merely a theory, is now, in 2003, U.S. policy. Hardly a conspiracy, the proposal was out there for anyone to see. But certainly an interesting case study of how columnists, commentators, and think-tank intellectuals can, with time and the election of a sympathetic president, change the course of American foreign policy.“(My emphasis) There was something different about this operation, however. Politicians out of power may plot how to return to power, but this group was more than that. It had been organized and was largely being run by the Jewish neo-cons whose activities we have been following, plus neo-con journalists and neo-con think-tank members with a long history of connections to the Israeli right wing and whose faces and opinions dominate the TV screens when issues of U.S foreign policy are under discussion. And as indicated above, it had the support of the leading American-Jewish lobbying organizations.

Heading up PNAC was William Kristol, editor of the Weekly Standard, the leading journal of the neo-cons, and Robert Kagan, a columnist for the magazine as well as for the Washington Post, whose columns in the Post and whose joint columns with Kristol in the Weekly Standard have maintained a steady drumbeat for Washington to send more U.S. troops to Iraq and keep to its original unilateralist position.

William (Bill) and father Irving Kristol are among the most well-known neocon Jews who'd been advocating the Israeli policy of removing Saddam for decades. The Weekly Standard had a policy of corroborating every lie about Iraq that began pouring out of the neocons' mouths during the lead-up to the invasion and spread out like wildfire by voices such as them and Judith Miller, herself closely affiliated to the neocons in government at the time.

In February of 1998, PNAC wanted to let President Clinton and the American public know its position on Iraq... Heading the list of over 40 signatures were its authors, Stephen Solarz and Perle, with the rest, beginning with Elliot Abrams, following alphabetically. Among the others were both Feith, and Wurmser, who at the time was heading the Middle East desk at the American Enterprise Institute. It included most of the board of JINSA and Wolfowitz, as well as soon-to-be Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, who must have become aware of the direction in which the center of power was moving and what opportunities it would provide.

Pretty blatant now, isn't it? Regarding the close collaboration between the media and the Bush administration neocons for propagating their idea that Iraq needed to be invaded, the closeness of media war-on-Iraq enthusiast Judith Miller to Vice President Cheney's Chief of Staff at the White House, 'Scooter' Libby, a neocon and Wolfowitz disciple, is a good example. Judith Miller had been complicit in trying to help cover up for Libby after he and a 'coterie of White House officials' leaked to the press the identity of a CIA cover agent, Valerie Plame, in revenge for her sending her husband to Niger to investigate the aforementioned 'yellowcake uranium from Niger bought by Iraq' propaganda. Yeah, the same one that appeared during Bush's 2002 State of the Union address that was written by David Frum, another neocon Zionist. He did just say 'from Africa' instead of 'Niger' though; too dumb to remember the name of the African country I guess.

Miller had made a career out of blaming everything on Iraq, including the Oklahoma City Bombing and the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. As for her friend Libby, had served as an attorney for near two decades for the MOSSAD-linked billionaire Marc Rich who had close ties to the Israelis and was recently pardoned by President Donald Trump after several years of the Plame affair.

So there's an idea of how this Zionist neocon network worked in railroading the US media, the US government, the US military and the American public into a war against Iraq. I've left out the anthrax letters part since I've not a firm grasp of that particular set of operations but suffice to say, having their cronies in the media to peddle their lies for the sake of a war the traditional intelligence officials, many military persons and the various career officials they purged in the DoD had no enthusiasm for, certainly was a blessing.

Putting into the proper Israeli perspective the demands PNAC made requires a look into the Israelis' own way of thinking, especially the Likud, vis-a-vis regional strategy. In 1982, famous Israeli whistleblower-turned-activist-and-author Israel Shahak leaked to the world press a translated form of a document titled 'A Strategy for Israel in the Nineteen Eighties' by Likud strategist and advisor to Ariel Sharon, Oded Yinon. Originally existing only in Hebrew, it appraised in detail the various faultlines present within the much-divided Arab world and how Israel was in a strong position to exploit those faultlines and secure hegemony via the break-up or balkanization of surrounding states into smaller, weaker ones. Keeping things to Iraq, it advocated its splitting up into Kurdistan, Sunni-dominated areas and Shia-dominated areas and suggested bringing down Iraq would remove a major obstacle to then curbing further potential threats. The connection to the neoconservative movement, which as we've discussed at this stage was busy in fulfilling strategic demands from the Israelis vis-a-vis Iraq and Iran (Israel briefly wished to try and see if it could influence the Iranians and not just ship weapons to them as part of the latter's deal with the neocon-Republican-CIA axis to release hostages in favour for the arms), was also noted by Shahak.

PNAC's already been described, and while the original document seems to have recently gone off the internet, much has been written about it such as the Blankfort article I listed above. It contained the broad geostrategic outlines of what the Oded Yinon paper had suggested, except with a lot more lip-service to US security and in more vague terms considering there wasn't a Communist boogeyman around in 1998 to harp on about.

However, in 1996, a group of the neocons which included Richard Perle (served in the DoD during Reagan and Bush Jr administrations, was part of the Tom Lantos and Wolfowitz spying affair where they used AIPAC as a conduit to sell information from Congressional hearings to Israel and major neocon) and Douglas Feith as well as David Wurmser and his wife Meyrav wrote a 6-page policy document for Benjamin Netanyahu who'd been newly elected as Israel's Likud PM. It regurgitated the same regional strategy vis-a-vis Iraq although paying more attention to Iran as a rising threat given the success of its religious partner Hezbollah (today a major force in anti ISIS operations and victor in the 2006 War against Israel) in attacking Israeli troops occupying Lebanon since 1982. The basic Likud approach since then has been to trash the idea of 'negotiations', angrily tear-up the memories of the Oslo 'Peace Process' (it was a bare-faced surrender and treachery by the PLO under Yasser Arafat and his crony Abu Mazen, i.e Mahmoud Abbas, whereby they sold off Palestinian land snatched via war by Israel in exchange for no concessions from Israel itself, even preventing Palestinian lawyers from viewing the terms of the deal being inked). Just like Begin considering returning the Sinai to Egypt as too 'soft', Netanyahu and the Likud have similarly been advocates of an aggressive Israel on all fronts; settlements, no Two State Solution (well this is obvious by now considering the proposed geography for a 2SS is impossible thanks to settlements) and aggression toward neighbouring states. Iraq was yet again slated for regime-change and policy guidelines for enhancing Israel's influence over US Congress (a remarkable success, given that the Congress is basically AIPAC's puppet now) and the US media (via think tanks etc such as FDD/AEI/JINSA/WINEP, all staffed with neocons or individuals close to Israel with a history of promoting myths about the countries its hyper-aggressive strategic paradigm as deemed targets since the 1980s). So basically, in geostrategic terms, just re-hashed Oded Yinon stuff. 

Israel's own actions also by and large compliment the policy advocacy contained in these documents over the decades. Destabilize and break up rival states so as to achieve greater Israeli dominance in the region. Hasn't really worked if one thinks about the actual objectives, but it has caused immense damage throughout the region and a lot of suffering. The US makes enemies and spends immense amounts of US taxpayer dollars in fighting wars it wouldn't be in had it not been for Israel via the neocons and the Lobby.

Oil and pipeline politics are, quite obviously, real (think Mossadeq coup in 1953 and gas politics between Europe, the US and Russia) but they featured nowhere in the build-up to the Iraq War. It was all taken forward by the neocons, mostly Jews who had an affinity for Israel.

Palestine is quite obviously a micro-concern. It's a bunch of powerless people the Israelis murder now and then. Discourse on Israel has to be aimed at the workings of its fifth column in the USA and the Jewish Lobby there which pushes Israeli interests that are harmful to everyone but Israel. The USA went to war with Iraq because of Israel's strategic depth inside of its administration and media, not the latest kid shot in the head in Gaza. 

/u/stuckinavim I honestly hope I organized this information as well as I could. I had to leave out Syria/Lebanon/Iran stuff as much as I could and focus on Iraq and there's still probably tidbits left out in the post itself yet which will probably be contained in the various articles, documents etc I linked.

So tl;dr Israel's strategic approach to things is to break up its neighbouring states and make them weak and pliable, installing pro-Israel governments there much of the times. It may well be changed in the coming days given that, for a number of reasons, this plan has been met with failure due to the efforts of various foreign actors, but it's worth following this stuff in detail.",energy

This is going to be long so please bear with me. Also, I am aware my current financials are bad and reflect years of financial irresponsibility and bad decisions so I don't need any reminders of that, thank you.
I am 32 years old. I have $0 in savings, $10k in credit card debt, an $11k bank loan, $30k in non federal student loans and $210k in federal student loans that I am currently paying back via the REPAYE option. I have 1 year of documented PSLF payments made on my federal loans (so, 12 out of the anticipated 120 required payments). No other debt, no kids. Long term live in girlfriend/future wife makes $150k a year, but has similar student loan amounts. She is 5 years into PSLF. All of the above mentioned debt is mine alone.
My minimum monthly bills (not including loan/cc payments) are around $1500.
I recently started a new career. It is a unionized (very good union too) civil service position in a big city that pays very well: $75k base pay with virtually unlimited overtime available, although it will be 1 year before I am eligible to work overtime. The average salary earned by those working this position is $100k - $125k (although you are really killing yourself to earn in the $120+ range), significant promotional opportunities are available. New contract and raises are negotiated every 2-3 years, average raises over the past 20 years have been 2-2.5% annually. Completely free medical, vision, and dental for me and any family I have, which continues after retirement until my death. Pension after retirement will be 50-60 % of my highest year of salary depending on how many years I put in before retiring (I pay 6% of my annual salary into my pension +2% for my post retirement medical benefits). I am also an admitted attorney, but being an attorney has nothing to do with my new job. My current position while not legal is still with a city/state government agency and therefore PSLF eligible.
I have never been good with money and I know that this is my opportunity to get my ducks in a row. Problem is I don't know where to even start. I think that this job will give me the opportunity to be financially secure in the newr future and long-term despite how much of a hole I am in. Am I wrong?
I know that I am eligible for both a 401k and a 457, which from what I understands means that I can essentially put away double the annual 401k amount? I feel like the best thing for me to do is to put away as much untaxed money as possible, because my REPAYE payments are calculated on my income after the fact. So not only would I be saving for retirement, but I would be saving how much I need to pay back to my student loans before they are forgiven via PSLF.
On the other hand, would the compound interest on 2 separate retirement accounts grow at the same rate over time as 1 account with a higher amount in it? I realize that sounds like a very dumb question but again I know nothing about this stuff. 
Should I even start saving now, or should I pay off my credit card/bank loan/non federal student loans asap?
Any help/advice, would be greatly appreciated.
Thank you.",finance

personalfinance,"Child on the way, no savings, no emergency fund, lots of debt, are we screwed?","Hi, just found out wife is pregnant last week and although I’m incredibly excited I’m also starting to slightly freak out about our finances, we have no savings, no emergency fund, and a decent amount of debt.

I own a house and have renters, they cover the mortgage but I cover all utilities, which is about 400/mo on average including internet which is 75.

Monthlies:
- 400 utilities
- 70 phone
- 70 her phone
- 80 car1 insurance
- 80 car2 insurance 
- 300 car 1 payments (3 years remain, 0%)
- 300 student loans (just reamortized this over 10 years to reduce monthlies to to put towards higher interest debt, this is my wifes but I think it’s around 20-30k 7% ish)
- 120 20k LOC interest only (7% ish)
- 30 Netflix and Spotify 
- 80 gas
- 800 food/restaurants

All the rest goes to the credit card, which is currently at 8k.

Refinancing the house to pull equity out isn’t an option, as I’m just barely at 20%. I am however going to look in to getting a HELOC set up to transfer some debt to as it should be much lower interest rate.

I’m also considering selling, or parking and uninsuring car 2, since we rarely use it (just an old rust bucket, but it’s reliable, wouldn’t get much for it, less than 2k imo)

I got a decent raise recently and am making 80k now, but I can’t rely on much if any income from my wife, she’s maybe averaged 20k a year since we’ve been together, and I don’t see this changing especially now that she’s pregnant, probably less now. Most of this debt is from getting married, I.e the engagement ring, wedding, and honeymoon. Another large chunk is from travelling. Another from putting a suite in our house, building a garage, patio, fence, and shed. Also my salary was much lower then, six years ago I was making 55k, then slowly got up to 66k until the end of 2017 when I got bumped to 75k, then just a month ago up to 80. I was feeling really good about paying down debt with my higher salary now, but now I’m worried that the increased cost of a child is going to more than offset the increase in my salary. It’s also going to be incredibly tight living in our current place with a child, but luckily it’s a two bedroom and I think we can make it work for a few years. 

Yes we did these things before we could afford them, yes we were(are?) irresponsible, and yes it’s our own fault we’re in the situation we are and now have to dig ourselves out of it. Alright now that that’s out of the way, are we screwed?

personalfinance,What will I plan after CC debt and e -fund?,"This is probably premature, I only just finally for the first time in my life have a real budget with a real plan to pay down my debt. I'm using YNAB, and got advice on this sub (wow I was spending dumb), and after only two weeks its really honestly working and I already feel like a changed person. Example, I got paid today and all of my bills are also paid. That has never happened. I have the year mapped out and even if it doesn't go perfect I can be free of Credit Card debt by February at the latest, maybe even the end of the year (this is my goal).

Then my priority has to be e-fund, and I will likely refinance my car (about 10k at that point) since my credit score should skyrocket (only negative is high credit use) and my current interest rate is 12.2%. I should have a healthy e-fund by July. I also have student loans at 50k, and I'm way behind on retirement (currently 5.5k in a 401k, I'm 28).

I guess my question, though premature, is what should I plan to do at that point? I know this is way in advance, but I kind of think having an idea of what that next step will be will give me extra motivation to move towards the place where I can start it.

So, at that point should I aggressively pay my car debt and student debt or should I be working more on retirement or other investments? Is there some other important goal I'm missing?",finance

personalfinance,Effective Interest on Amortized Loans,"So I've had a lot of shower thoughts lately about loan amortization (mortgages being the most prevalent form) and I feel like I've come across a few insights which to me have been novel.

Before I go further I recognize that either a) Someone more expertise has already published these thoughts or b) It's been thought of and then proven wrong. Please give me any further resources or discussion if you find either of these to be true.

So basically the bottom line is that maybe we should be thinking about ""effective interest"" when it comes to loans over the APR. Essentially as loan interest ""reverse compounds"" as you pay off principal, you effectively pay a much lower rate than the APR if converted to an average simple interest rate much in the same way your effective gains are much higher when investments compound.

That being said... The math completely works against you when the loan is amortized and you sell your asset before the loan is paid off (not new knowledge).

I've created a spreadsheet that effectively converts your mortgage interest into an effective simple interest rate in 4 different scenarios (selling at 5 years, 10 years, 15 years and 30 years). It is primarily used to compare a 15 year and 30 year mortgage. I've also added a ratio (formatted as a percentage) of interest to equity.

[https://imgur.com/a/JNzCCL7](https://imgur.com/a/JNzCCL7)

Conversion to effective simple interest rate is done with the following formula: (total interest paid / period in years) / equity.

This doesn't take into account down payments, taxes, insurance etc... to keep math simple and it's set to 100,000 and 5% also to make math simple. Of course the concept scales to any principal and rate.

2,124 student loans (5% interest rate - at this pace, will be paid off in 6 and a half years.) 
1000 ally account 
825 rent 
800 wedding expenses (paying until 10/2019) 
100 cell phone 
380 car payment + car insurance (lease) 
7.5 spotify 
25 sling 
42 internet 
40-50 electric bill 
100 paying off furniture recently financed (another 7 months to go) Probably another 200 on groceries/dog food.

I have no credit card debt.

Approximately 25k in savings as emergency fund (ally bank I believe 1.6% interest)

Yes my wedding will be expensive but that's kinda the way it is around here unless we eloped and that just isn't on the table.

I think this will likely have to go on the back burner and will likely continue to rent until my loans are paid off so we can live comfortably.

I keep going back in forth in my head on what to do with my income. Part of me wants to just tackle my student loans, then the other part of me stresses myself out that if I did that I won't be contributing to retirement for at least another 5 years which would make me 32. At that point I can easily max out a 401k or what not.

I've done a lot of reading and I keep seeing this is a difficulty situation for a lot of millenials. My wedding expense ($800) gets freed up next September 2019 and could definitely do some damage combining that and my monthly $1000 to Ally. But I'd love to hear what you guys think as I really need some guidance.

Would it be wiser to attempt to max out my 401k after the wedding or tackle my student loans and try to get them paid as quickly as possible? Or do a bit of both and do some sort of hybrid game plan? I do not want to fall behind on retirement and I don't want to be a struggling home owner so I wanted to reach out to you experts. Thanks all!",finance

personalfinance,Starting school all over [X-post from r/financialaid],"Hey I’m on mobile so I am sorry for the crappy formatting. This is a throwaway account. 

I did some college and spent around 16k of my federal aid. I dropped out without graduation because I became too ill to go to school AND I had to keep retaking classes to raise my GPA so I got too many credit hours at my local college. 
Here is where it gets weird:

It came to light that my mother ( I am no longer in contact with her) has münchousens by proxy, narcissistic personality disorder and a slew of other mental illnesses. I have been told since I was a kid that I was sick and mentally ill. I spent 13 years on psyche meds that I did not need. They did not work correctly and made me very sick, on top of me having bizarre reactions to them. My mother blamed the reactions on my character. I became so sick that I just had to stop going. The meds made it impossible to get out of bed most days. I felt like complete garbage around the clock. This greatly impacted my ability to function, go to class, and complete my work. I ended up on SSI disability. It later came to light that I was the scapegoat child in a narcissistic family and she was making me and my siblings sick for attention from doctors. She is also a sadist. My psychiatrist helped me figure it out. He is willing to back me up. Present day I am on no medicine and have perfect health. 

My question for all of you is this:
Is there someone I can talk to about my loans to explain what happened so I can start over? I REALLY want to go back to school and the major I will be pursuing will require as much aid as I can get. 
I can prove I was sick during that time. My psychiatrist today told me to start asking around to see what my options are. I literally want to start from the ground up and just redo everything. That medication ruined a good portion of my life and I really want to make something good out of a bad situation. 
Could you guys help me? 
Thank you so much for anything you might have to offer.",finance
personalfinance,Loan from parent to help with down payment?,"Wife’s mother wants to loan us $100K to help get dream home. Would not have to pay back for five years then at a low interest rate, think 2% or so.  I don’t like the idea as we’d have a hard time affording without the additional money for down payment. And i hate debt. Any thoughts are welcome.",finance
personalfinance,Loan to consolidate credit card debt?,"My husband and I are working steadily to pay off several credit cards we have. We have a monthly budget that I stay on top of, but we don't have a lot of money left over after bills and necessities. (With a very modest grocery/gas budget, we have $46 left after bills).

Anyway, I have 6 credit cards with balances ranging between $233 and $3945. Altogether, it totals $14,245. We make the minimum monthly payments on all except one, which we pay $40 over on. The total of all the payments equals $479/mo.

I received a ""pre-approved"" loan offer for $15,000 at 11.55% fixed interest for 36 months. There is a 1%-6% origination fee, taken from the loan proceeds. (Won't know the exact fee until we officially apply). There is no penalty for paying off the loan early.

The payments for this loan come out to $495/mo.

Would this be worth it to do? All of our cards have interest rates between 20-30%. Since we are only able to make minimum payments, I feel like it will take forever to pay them off. At least with this loan, we'd have a ""finish line"" of 36 months and it's done.

Does it sound like there's any important factors I'm overlooking though? Would taking this loan out be worth it? Any advice would be great. I'm just pretending like I know what I'm doing.",finance
investing,Poor international returns here to stay?,"I am wondering if anyone else has thoughts on VGTSX (Vanguard total international).

Is anyone else getting fed up with poor international, particularly European, returns? I know the strategy behind rebalancing is rolling into the comparatively cheaper asset at the expense of the better performing one, but within the last year I have been going overweight VTSAX. 

It's hard to make a case for Europe and other international markets vs American other than the lower P/E ratios. Other than Spotify I can't think of a single disruptive European tech company in the last 10 years. It's a tougher place to do business and seems like a more laid back culture overall.

personalfinance,"Starting first adult job, how much to save in 403(b)?","The premise: First job as a teacher, earning $50k/yr gross in high COL area. I will also be receiving a $1200 stipend and can work in the summer to add 3-5k. 

11% of my salary is already being deducted for my state pension, but I am looking to also save in a Vanguard 403(b). However, I am not sure what % of my salary I should put in given that I still have loans to pay off. **Realistically, I cannot afford to put much in, but I don't want to miss out on building my savings.**

After all of my deductions (pension, taxes, union dues), I've conservatively calculated my takehome to be $2700/m. I think I am lowballing this and it should be more like $3000/m but I want to be safe.

Expenses (so far) per month:

Rent - $1250

Utilities - $100

Transit pass - $85

Student Loans - $1000 (4 private loans @ $200/m, $200/m for PSLF-eligible federal loans). 3 private loans are @ 8% while one is @ 11%

ROTH IRA - $50 (when I was a student, not sure how I will adjust this)

Groceries - $200-250

Eating out - $50

Personal items - $30

Clothing (need to build new professional wardrobe) - $50-75

Right now I am already in the red/breaking even, but I still have a four month's grace period on my loans to build up my emergency fund (I already have about $2000) and get a jump on that horrific 11% loan. I am not sure if it is worth it to refinance them. I am coming off of a year of not being employed (full-time student teaching) so my finances have been severely depleted. I know that the numbers are grim but I have a guaranteed 4-5% salary increase each year and I hope to move into the next salary lane ($1000/yr in tuition reimbursement...) in a few years as well. My loans suck but I knew what I was getting into and for my career (I teach in a niche high-needs field in a great Title I district) it was worth it.

tl;dr: 403(b) option in pensioned position but budget is already stretched to the limit. how much to save at this point, if at all?",finance
financialindependence,Running our numbers. Is it really this 'simple'?,"Been reading this subreddit for a while now and kind of taking it all in. My wife met someone at work who is trying to FIRE and she told me about it (she thought it was a novel idea and was excited to inform me), which led to us crunching our own FIRE numbers. The results seem very optimistic, but I figured you all could help clarify.

Our current situation:

* Ages: 31
* Income: 200k/year, about evenly split. This has ramped up from \~80k 4 years ago (we have a lot of schooling). Depending on my wife’s desire to continue at her high stress job, her income could be jumping 15k/year for next 7/8 years, then to 500k. This is unlikely (more likely she tops out low 100s and cruises along). Mine will be slow and steady, with probably a 50k jump in 5/6 years.
* Retirement savings: 225k. We currently max out 401ks. With employer contributions and the pseudo-work pensions we get (not really a pension, just additional money given to us every year into the 401k in addition to the match) we are contributing \~50k/year. My 401k plan through works allows post-tax contributions (55k/year total).
* Other savings: 70k (our overall pretax savings rate is \~40%)
* House: worth 750k. 450k mortgage remaining (only debt)
* Inheritance: My MIL is open about her finances to my wife. They are currently worth 3 million and looking at an inheritance themselves of about 1 million. They are super frugal and I can imagine their net worth increasing significantly before they pass. We would be getting 50% of the estate.
* Lifestyle Inflation: My wife is getting a bit upset that people 7 years her junior are driving fancy cars and such (she understands that they are most likely driving around in their unfunded 401k, but it still grinds her gears). Knowing how much we save and how much we have, she really wants to splurge on a new car. I do not see an issue with it as we are still maxing retirement. I might get one myself when my current car dies.

The math:

* Our living expenses: My take home pay (after tax/insurance/401k) is 60k. I pay all the bills, the mortgage (40k/year, 10k of that tax) and 90% of other ancillary costs. Wife’s entire salary goes to non-retirement savings and large expenses (like furniture/renovations for house). Rounding up to be very generous, we could live off of 75k/year like kings even if we still had our mortgage. Of note, we just had a baby, so expenses are likely to go up but they will not alter our retirement contributions of 50k/year.
* Retirement investments: Plugging in a starting value of 225k with 50k yearly addition and a 7% interest rate into a compound interest calculator, at age 65 we should have 9 million. That seems…… unreal and is clearly way over what we would need.  So we started going backwards to a point that seemed reasonable. We would like another kid and asked: what would retirement look like after kid #2 graduates college? Figuring that to be about 25 years from now, that gives 4.6 million. We went down to 20 years… 3 million.
* For purposes of retirement, I am ignoring any potential inheritance and SS.   I consider them bonuses, as they are too far in the future to be any level of certainty. 

Knowing the 4% rule and such, and me and my wife being ultra conservative, we decided that we would bank on 3% WR. A portfolio of 3 million would provide 90k a year. Our current expenses are 75k (with a 40k mortgage to boot). Mortgage gone would mean expenses of 45k (ignoring tax increases).

Does this mean it is possible to retire at age 51? I am always an uncertain how to correlate expenses now and equivalent expenses in the future. If I live on 75k now, will 90k in future money cover these expenses? I am fuzzy on this, but does the 7% rate of return factor in inflation and such?

We are interested in FIRE, not really for the RE, but the FI. We are natural savers, but actually putting the numbers down blew us away. I am more excited than my wife, who doesn’t believe most of the calculations. But if our savings habits mean we can retire in our early 50s and travel the world, it would make us quite happy.

Can you all confirm or shoot down or modify our thinking here?

Thanks!",finance
personalfinance,Low level employee versus Assistant Manager,"Hey all. Long time lurker, was looking for some advice if you have any.

This post may be jumping the gun a bit, but I think getting some advice before heading into a potential interview may help me avoid alienation in my current position. Right now, I make $17.75/hour with at least a couple of hours of overtime taking care of individuals with special needs. It’s very low key, not very stressful and my co-workers and bosses are awesome. I’m on track for a small promotion by January in my current promotion. I haven’t seen a raise smaller than $1/hr, so I’m just assuming I’d be at least $.50/hr more.

That being said, my hiring manager/head of HR has been trying to get me to go to another house. I’d be a substantial promotion to an assistant manager, which would be a couple rungs higher than the advocate position mentioned above. I’m not sure of the raise or hours, and only know vague things about the new manager I would be under but they were not great. I assume I would be able to pick most of my own hours,  and would have very little oversight. One of the cons would be I would have to work at least one overnight, which I don’t have to right now. 

I’ve heard from current employees that upon LEAVING my current house, you tend to burn a bridge with my current manager. He’s an awesome boss and guy, but loyalty and honesty are very high in his book. I don’t know how he would feel if I don’t get the new position and am still in the same house. I feel a sense of loyalty to him, and our house is currently in a transition where we’re understaffed. I guess what I’m guessing at is should I apply for the new position and let him know? I’ve done this is the past and haven’t seen any negative side effects. I’d love to hear your advice and sorry for the long post.",finance

I've read some good things about SoFi and Earnest. Can anyone  tell me about your experiences with them and advice on how to refinance?  Was planning on applying this weekend.

I  figured that I would not refinance my federal student loans because I  get some good income based repayment benefits and the interest rates are  not too high so I've been chipping away at those pretty readily. Is it  possible to only refinance the private loan and leave my federal ones  the way that they are? The companies don't require me to refinance all  of them, do they?

Also I've read some  things about discount ""links"" for these refinance companies or promos?  Does anyone know of anything I could do to save some money when  applying?

personalfinance,Where to allocate savings after maxing out IRA.,"So, a little background on my situation to give everyone a better understanding where I'm at. 

Tomorrow (pay day) I am going to be maxing out my IRA for 2018, which is always my main financial goal for the year. Now I am wondering where to put my money for the rest of the year. I am 25yo and retirement isn't an issue because I am contributing 7% of my income to my 401k, so I don't feel a need to put any more in there. My main 2 goals I want to push toward are paying off my car loan and saving for a down payment on a house.

My house savings are allocated between a lower-risk mutual fund and a high-yield savings account (Marcus: 1.85%APY). My car loan has an interest rate of 2.9%APR so my initial thought would be to work on paying that off first. But then I question if I would miss out on higher returns by investing it. But everyone keeps talking about a correction coming so who really knows.

personalfinance,Analyze my food spending (family of 5),"We are a family of five. My wife and I are early 30s, our three boys are 3.5-6.5 (yes, our home is beautiful chaos).

I calculate we spend an average of $2.86/day/person/meal, or $8.60/day/person (the former is the latter divided by 3). I have my thoughts on comparisons and optimizing at the end of this post.

Category definitions for the table below:

* **Groceries**: Food purchased at the grocery store. Doesn't include other things bought at the store (household supplies, personal care items, etc.). Occasional wine/hard cider is tracked separately and not included here.
* **Solo**: Mostly my work lunch meals, and the occasional solo meal for my wife. She is a SAHM but gets dinner alone every Monday before class, and the occasional meal out when she is coming/going to an evening appointment or meeting.
* **Couple**: Occasional drive-thru or takeout for me and her if we're feeding the kids something at home but it's easier for us to swing by Chipotle or something like that on the way home (our home supply of quick meals for them lasts longer than for us...sometimes PB&amp;J won't cut it for us like it does for them). This does not include the (rare) date night, which we budget separately or is covered by a gift card or cash from either set of parents (they like to send us on dates 1-2 times a month, and take the kids overnight).
* **Family**: Usually wife + kids if they are out and about, sometimes just the kids, and the (predominantly) weekend family dining or takeout. Rarely sit-down restaurant for logistical and cost reasons; usually it's fast food or takeout eaten at home, at a park, or in the car on our way to/from a family outing.
* **Breakfast**: Mostly my wife's 3-4 coffee runs a week. I don't normally eat breakfast, so very little of this is me. It includes occasional diner-type breakfast dates my wife takes with one of our kids (individually, rotating) 1-2 times a month. The rare diner-type breakfasts with just me and her I categorize under Couple above.
* **Snacks**: Mostly separate, spur-of-the-moment snack runs to the corner store. I don't split out snack food purchased in grocery trips. These trips sometimes include a 6-pack of hard cider or a (cheap) bottle of wine, but that is a separate budget category - this is just the food portion.

I tallied up the totals from June through mid-August, divided by 2.5 for a recent monthly average, and also divided the total by the number of transactions for an approximate ""per-trip"" average.

|Category|Monthly Avg|Receipt Avg|Notes|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Groceries|$585.69|$41.83|Average of 3.5 purchase per week|
|Solo|$192.38|$7.88||
|Couple|$45.70|$14.29|About double Solo average, makes sense|
|Family|$234.48|$15.43|Average is deceiving: it's a lot of $9-$13 and $21-$26 transactions|
|Breakfast|$108.73|$6.63|Average pulled down by many $3-$4 coffee runs|
|Snacks|$122.49|$6.52|Pretty tight band of $4-$8 per ticket|
|Total|$1,289.47||$8.60/person/day|

So groceries are only 45% of total food spending. 4-5 dinners are at home with this food, 3-4 weekday breakfasts and lunches (for all but me) are also from the grocery food. Most weekend food is out, though at least one dinner is home made. So comparing ""proportion of meals"" to proportion of cost, meals out take up a disproportionately high portion of the spending, and it's mostly concentrated on the weekends.

My thoughts for trimming things:

* We just started Shipt (personal shopping/delivering) and that has already cut down on number of grocery trips and made the orders more efficient - less grabbing things on impulse mostly. The Grocery total in the table includes the monthly subscription and tip. So less frequent but more efficient grocery trips is one factor.
* Frequent but cheap snack runs really add up! We can do better by buying in bulk; the markup at the corner store/gas station is much higher than in bulk at Costco or even a supermarket. These are usually also concentrated on the weekends - snacks for movie night/Netflix-and-chill, etc. It's better to have these on-hand than to do separate runs.
* Family meals out: I think the key here may be lowering the frequency but upping the quality. If we're doing a family meal out, we shouldn't settle for eating drive-thru food while in the van on the way to/from something; we should ""make a day of it"" and perhaps spend a little more per ticket (but less frequency means lower total cost).
* \~75% of the meals out spending (other than my work lunches) is Friday through Sunday. It would go a long way to plan ahead a little. Even reducing by 1 per weekend would add up over a month's time.
* Work lunches. I can do better about bringing leftovers. Most of the time I forget to grab them out of the fridge in the morning.

The USDA Food Plans says the average grocery spending for a family like ours is $865 (low-cost plan) to $1,068 (moderate plan). So our total food cost is above this, but grocery spending is far below even the ""thrifty"" plan ($669). What I get from that is if we replaced some meals out with meals from home, we would be just as fed but at a lower absolute cost (and shifting the proportion more toward grocery food). The efficiency metric (in my mind at least) is ""cost per 100 calories"" (and each member of the household has a different daily target number of 100-calorie units based on our age/gender) and I'm sure that on average grocery food delivers a lower cost per 100 calories than meals out.

personalfinance,"Want to refinance student loans through CU, and get a quote of what the interest rate will be, but they need to do a hard pull on my credit to do so.","I currently have my student loans consolidated through Citizens Bank. My total student loans are \~$31,000. My interest rate is 6.52% and my current credit score is 755.

I want to get that interest rate down further if I can. I spoke with Citizens and gave them my score and loan total, and they quoted my refinanced loans at 6.24% for 10 years fixed. 

I decided to shop around at credit unions to see if I can get a lower rate, and I spoke with my local CU, and the woman estimates that with my score, it will be high 4%'s or lower 5%'s. This sounds great, but they need to do a hard pull of my credit in order to quote me an interest rate.

I guess I'm just worried that if they do the hard pull and quote me around what I'm currently getting (6.52%) and I don't end up taking the refinance that the hard pull will be pointless and just affect my credit. Am I worrying for no reason? Should I just do the hard pull and see what I get? If I get the high 4% or low 5% I will definitely take that.

A little about myself: I’ve been covering politics for NBC News for over a year, but my journalism career began in newspapers covering local news. I spent time at local outlets in Indiana, Albany, New York and here in New York City before covering national news. In the past, I’ve visited Rikers Island to interview a mother [implicated in the death of her 6-year-old son](https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20161007/west-harlem/zymere-perkins-6-year-old-harlem-mother-geraldine-perkins-rysheim-smith-interview-rikers/), traveled to Upstate New York to understand how a [child sex abuse scandal affected an insular Amish community](https://www.timesunion.com/tuplus-local/article/A-predator-amid-the-unworldly-Amish-6194267.php) and uncovered how public officials in New York’s Saratoga County [misled taxpayers about a failed energy project](https://www.timesunion.com/tuplus-local/article/3-million-Saratoga-project-big-loser-before-6764281.php). 

Here at NBC News I’ve focused a good chunk of my energy covering the president’s now-defunct vote fraud commission, different policy changes and how statehouses are grappling with changes to federal programs. That’s what interested me to see how changes to the H2-B visa program were affecting American businesses.",energy

personalfinance,Liquidating 401k to pay debt. Is this ever a good idea?,"I’m 33 and have a moderately sized 401k in which I am fully vested. My wife and I have about 80k in debt (not including mortgage) and about 68k of it is student debt. 

I know liquidating my 401k will cost me a 10% early withdrawal penalty as well as my normal taxes on it. 

Is it worth it to bite the bullet and just pay off 12k of revolving credit with higher interest rates than my 401k returns? I can take the rest and pay off my smaller student loans. This will free up about 400 a month in monthly payments which I can now snowball into my larger student loans.

personalfinance,26 Y/O Refinancing car loan,"Basically I bought a brand new car this year, its a great car and I love it. I put 13k down on a a car that sold to me for 30,100 OTD.


The only dilemma is the interest rate is 6% at 5 years. My credit score at the time of getting the car was according to the credit report they gave me about 715. My score has taken a hit since then, about 685. Regardless I felt like 6% was pretty high.. The only thing I can really look at for determining why my rate was 6% was I had something like 60% utilization. I still do have about 60%, but I have cash in to lower this to ~25% right now. I realize this isn't smart but all of my credit accounts have always been low limits compared to my take home pay (I take home about 1800 after 401k and benefits but my 4 credit cards have max limits of 1500-3k). Since I've decided a home is a long term goal I know I need to reduce the utilization and budget better.

From what I understand about the dealership(s) that sell volkswagen cars if you qualify for their financing they don't keep running your credit and just give you their A, B, or C rate based on score. ( I also know this because my score was only ran against VW credit). I obviously wished I locked this up sooner but I'm trying to really save money now. I just changed insurances to save about $60/mo and I think I can save some cash here too but am not experienced in doing so.


any advice on what I should do? If I can lower my utilization should I expect it to be possibly to get a rate like 3.5%? I know 100% my loan has no repayment penatlies and it also allows me to refinance if i wanted right now.",finance

personalfinance,$60k in student loan debt about to lose 1 job,"My husband is a public school teacher in an urban high school. He is starting his 3rd year and teaches English I. He has about $40K + $20K in interest, so total of $60K in total in un-subsidized student loan. He was in default on his loan for years and it was after we got married that we got on track and are now out of it. He had to pay like $10/month for a year to get out of it and now we can pay directly to fedloan but the payments have gone up to $340/month.   


I am currently pregnant and recently found out that I'm high-risk and will need to take medical leave soon. For those interested, I have been diagnosed with cervical insufficiency and I was 2cm dilated last week and had to have emergency surgery to sew close my cervix. I'm trying to stay on as long as possible at my job but I don't think that will be feasible for much longer. Like maybe another month at most. It's unpaid medical leave and my due date is 12/25 so I can probably be back at work in the new year if I have to. Financially I think I definitely have to, even though my husband wants me to stay home w/ the baby for a few years. 

So our income goes from $100K to just his of $55K. But with rent ($1050), car payments ($400), insurance ($300), bills ($200), credit card debt mostly medical ($15K; $700), we won't be able to afford the $340/month. 

Just for full disclosure, not only am I experiencing pregnancy related medical issues, my husband had back surgery over the summer for his chronic back pain. While it wasn't the best move in terms of money, I'm glad we were able to get it done. I'm happy to say he is finally pain free after years of chronic pain! It's been a little over a month and he's still doing great.

personalfinance,In over my head with debt. Need advice,"Where to begin. 
I'm 25. I have about 10k in credit card debt. A foreclosed home for 155k . Student loans for 11k. Back taxes for 2k. And some medical Bills that  not paying on currently for about 3k. 

I bought my first house 2 years ago with a now current ex of mine. We had a fallen out and she destroyed the house beyond repair but I couldn't prove anything and talked with multiple lawyers and police about it and in the end had to foreclose the house. 
That has now dropped my credit score down 270points to a 517. 
While with her I made some bad decisions and got a few credit cards. Bought a lot of appliances and stuff for the house on them thinking I'll be fine and can easily pay them back. They have no interest for 2 years. Itll be easy.

Once leaving me she proceeded to take everything from me. Not only did she destroy the house but she took everything I had bought. On top of that the interests started to kick in. 
So for the past year or so I've been paying on the credit cards and living paycheck to paycheck feeling like I'm digging dirt out of a hole that just keeps filling up. 

The interest is killing me. Emotionally and financially.  I've talked to a lot of people who suggested trying to get a loan to consolidate all the debt. Well I tried that this morning and got denied. Figured as much with the foreclosure. 

So now I'm to the point where a few people suggested ""if you are struggling and unhappy then just stop paying the cards. Your credit is messed up anyways. You're 25. You can recover.""

So now I'm turning to reddit. Any opinion on what I should do. Should I continue paying them. Or just stop paying them and be happy with the money I am saving. 

A little note
4 credit cards. 
468$ a month in payments. 
All 4 have interest rates out the wazoo. And all 4 put about 390$ back on the cards in interest. 

I've though about letting the two biggest ones go and paying down the other two. But idk I feel trapped. 

Thanks and love , reddit.",finance

personalfinance,Need help figuring out which debt to focus on.,"So, just want to start this by saying that I’m so ashamed of the hole I’ve gotten myself in with student loans and credit cards. I, at one time, needed the cards to help me pay bills while I was dealing with unemployment. I used to get myself sick with worrying about these things, but I recently moved home with my parents, got a better paying job. And want to start setting myself up for a good future aka retirement. 

But I have mega huge graduate government loans totaling $231k. I’m on an income driven repayment plan, but I make so little that the monthly payments are $0 a month. I try to throw $10 at each loan (there’s four) when I have extra money. 

I have 3 private loans (Navient unfortunately):
$2,671 (11.250% interest)
$12,632 (9.125%)
$3510.42 (11.625%) - my co-signer is helping me with half of this monthly payment. 
I make these payments on time every single month. 

I have a car payment that is finally done May 2019. The monthly payments are $298 per month. 

I have two credit cards that are in collections, but are being automatically paid each month. I believe one payment is $80 a month and the other is $107. One has stopped accruing interest. While the other one still does. I am not sure the exact interest rates. But from what I’ve read on this sub, credit cards should tried to be paid off first.  But why is that? Do they look worse on a credit score compared to the massive student loans I have?

What’s a good way to check your credit score without it taking a hit? 

My one big goal is to be debt free. Especially rid myself of those private loans from Navient. I want to start a IRA for retirement, but I’m not sure where to even start or when.

investing,mortgage vs ES-mini futures,"I need some help to understand what are significant risks in the option #2 in comparison to a more traditional option #1:

Let's say i want to buy a house for $500k and i have $500k cash in my pocket. And the options i consider:

1) Take a regular 30 years mortgage with let's say 20% down payment. So now i have 400k invested (to keep it simple 100% SPY) + i owe the bank 400k with ~4% interest.

2) Buy house for 100% cash, then buy 3 ES mini futures and in this case i have 427k invested money and i owe my broker about 36k on margin with 3.4% interest (that's what IB gives me today).


I know the taxation would be different, so for futures i can't do long term it's always 60/40, also option 2 assumes i have a good enough amount of fully paid stocks to cover margin requirements, i'm limited in terms of investment options (ES, NQ + a few more). But these limitations doesn't look significant in comparison to the fact that i borrow 10x less =&gt; my monthly payment would be roughly 10x less.

Seems the biggest risk - my broker change interest rate dramatically. But it needs to be quite a change to cover the 10x difference in a borrowed sum.

personalfinance,"19 y/o college student, terrible with money and looking for advice","I've been working part time jobs for the past 5 years of my life. If I had to estimate I've probably earned close to $12,000 from part time work in that time and yet I have nothing saved up. Money comes in and money comes out. I never had a concept of saving let alone a savings account of any sort. I think I need to change soon and I need some advice. Here's a rundown of my financial situation:

I've worked a part time job this summer and I'm going to enter the school year with around $900 in my checking account.

I've secured part time work at my university for when the semester starts. 10 hours a week @ $10/hr for $100 a week gross income

My education is fully funded by scholarships/loans. By the looks of it I will graduate with around 20k in student loans, mostly subsidized and all federal. I'm majoring in CS and don't plan on going to grad school. 

My wonderful and supportive parents to whom I owe the world are paying for my meal plan which will feed me for the whole semester minus around 10 days worth of food and coffee/snacks/eating off campus.

So yeah the embarrassing part is that I really don't have that many expenses. The one regular expense that I have is that I have to pay my brother back for a plane ticket that he bought me: $430 which I'm planning on paying back @ $100/mo

So what do I spend my money on? Looking at my account I can just sum it up as stuff and food. I eat out quite a bit and $10 a meal adds up quickly. I also buy coffee some of the times when I don't feel like making it at home. I also find myself buying clothes. Nothing particularly expensive. I look around thrift stores, marshall's, ross, ebay, and I buy name brand pants and shoes. If I need a new pair of headphones, I buy cheapo $10 ones on amazon and get a new pair when I inevitably lose them. If I wanna watch a movie I'll rent it for $4 on youtube. If I need some school supplies/small appliances for my dorm I'll order decently inexpensive stuff from amazon. 

The nice thing is I'm going into my semester soon so my food costs will be covered but I feel like I'm just going to slip into the same habits when I'm home for winter/summer breaks.

The point is, money just slowly leaks out of my account from paycheck to paycheck. I try and buy inexpensive stuff and do stuff like only drink water when eating out but everything still adds up so quickly that I end up just anxiously waiting for the next payday. The obvious suggestion would be to open a savings account but I feel like I sacrifice a lot of liquidity doing that. I can open one with my wells fargo account. I'd have to have a minimum balance of $300 and my monthly take home income is only going to be roughly $300. Should I just open a savings and try and save a little bit every week while maintaining a comfortable amount in my checking, transferring between the two when needed? Should I look into bonds/long term investing? Kinda unrelated but I don't have a credit card atm and would like to start building credit. According to WF my fico score is 673. Should I apply for a card and try and slowly build credit? 

Sorry if this is a bit of a mess. I'm just kinda sick of my spending habits and really want to change. I would greatly appreciate advice on any of what I talked about above.",finance

We don't know when that will be (federal government operations being the napalm-fueled dumpster fire that they are).  But new company won't wait.

investing,Optimised Portfolio Simulation,"So I'm completely new to investing but have done a huge amount of reading over the last few months. I'm sure this has been done many times before but wasn't sure what to type into google, and in any case thought I'd have a bit of fun building this myself.

This may already be obvious to most but I wanted to find out (in hindsight) the optimum asset class allocations within an annually rebalanced portfolio over the last few years of market data. This assumes an initial 1k investment at year 1 and an additional 1k drip-fed per year following, with no money withdrawn. I used the data from https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/historical-asset-class-returns as my basis (1994 - 2018), but only included:

- US stock market, Europe stocks, cash, short term treasury, intermediate term treasury, 10 yr treasury, REIT, gold.

Using excel solver, starting with an equal weighted portfolio and allowing anywhere between 0-100% of any asset class, and assuming I didn't hash up the maths anywhere, the otimum was 29.3% US stocks and 70.7% REIT (zero everything else). Stripping out REIT as an option gives 100% US stocks.

I'm assuming this is not surprising to anyone? I have no intention to put all my money directly into US stocks but thought it was an interesting exercise for a newbie who is trying to learn some fundamentals about asset allocation and risk. Past performance not a reliable indication of future performance...and all that good stuff.

Any thoughts or comments appreciated :)",finance
personalfinance,Annuity Stumped Me,"I don't know if this is the right sub reddit to post this but since it is related to finance might as well. So I was computing for annuities and got a bit confused. So I used a principal worth of $4M, an interest rate of 12% and 35 years as my time. I tried computing for the annuity of a quarterly interest and an annual interest with 12% as the interest rate. What confused me is that the result for the compounded quarterly interest is a lot smaller than the annual interest. Shouldn't it be the other way around since every 3 months the interest rate will be compounded? I'm really stumped here. I'm a newbie on finances but I am eager to learn.

Given:

P = $4 000 000

i = 12% or 0.12

n - 35 years

A = ?

12% compounded quarterly interest:

A = P ( i / 1 - ( 1 + i )^(-n) )

A = $4 000 000 ( (0.12/4) / 1 - ( 1+ (0.12/4) )^(-140) )

A = $ 121,945.15

!2% annual interest

A = $4 000 000 ( 0.12 / (1 - (1.12)^(-35) )

A = $ 489,266.48

personalfinance,(CAN) Living with a partner with debt,"So the title does a lot of the work already however here is some more context and back story... 

My partner (26) and I (25) both come from middle class families; I as a single child and he as the youngest of three. We’ve been together for 3 years now and living together for 2 (pretty sure that constitutes common-law right?), and it’s become apparent that I am more frugal and disciplined with my finances than he is. 

When we started dating he was honest about the fact that he had some debt, roughly $ 10,000 which he accumulated after he previously had moved in with an ex and subsequently charged a bunch of rent and living expenses to a credit card. He assured me that he was paying it down but whether it was above and beyond his minimum payments I had no idea. I suspect it was just the monthly minimums so add a few grand more into that number for interest. 

After a year into our relationship, he ended up transferring his cc debt into a line of credit and exchanged his cc card for a visa debit so he could better manage his debt. My credit score is really good so we’ve always suspected that it’s the reason we managed to secure our current apartment rental. 

Another year later and his old used truck dies; it wasn’t a great buy and it ended up being a money pit to repair frequently anyway. Add on repairs for the old one, and the cost of a new used truck altogether and he’s looking at a few more grand on his line of credit. 

Without going too far down the rabbit hole or completely off topic about our relationship, we’ve both discussed that we are committed to one another; we both see a long-term future together and have always had great communication, so he is very aware of my concerns about marrying into debt and his financial disciple (or lack thereof). Needless to say it’s a sore spot for him but he’ll still come to the table to talk finances. 

CURRENT SITUATION: 

Today, he’s got about $20,000 on a line of credit that he is now stressing about because the monthly minimum payments are becoming too expensive. He’s looking at an 11% interest rate, which in hindsight he regrets not agreeing to a fixed rate of 7% when the option was on the table. I think he thought he would be able to pay it down quickly enough.  

In terms of income we are mostly on the same page, bringing in roughly 40-45,000 salary per year. Additionally I have a TFSA, some regular savings accounts (travel, yearly expenses), and have recently come into some money. I also have an emergency savings account that I would never dip into. 

I could never pay down all of his debt but I’d like to hear some perspectives on the possibility of helping him pay some of it off. We have briefly discussed the possibility of me paying down a chunk ($10,000) and then him paying me back (with a repayment plan), instead of paying a bank with an 11% interest rate. We also talked about me helping to contribute to his monthly payments so the remainder of the line of credit is repaid in half the time (again with an agreed to repayment plan). A written contract would be a must but I also know that I should accept this as a gift of sorts, with an expectation that I may never see this money again. It will take a chunk of the money I have been saving for a future home, however it might get us on the right foot of being able to utilize both incomes to save if we do so. 

TLDR: my partner has $20,000 in debt and I could help him pay it down. $10,000 up front and then additional monthly payments from me (on top of the ones he pays already) to help eliminate it completely. With a repayment plan so he can pay it down and then repay me.  

Have you ever helped a partner repay their debt? What were some of the conditions you agreed to? Did it end up negatively affecting your relationship? What other insight do you have? What haven’t we thought of yet?",finance
personalfinance,NFCU Is Refusing to Count my Next Month's Payment,"Recently, I wanted to get a head start and just have my CC bill for August crossed off the list of my budget.

I'm beyond angry and explaining this to customer support is painful.  Is there anything I can do?

gaming,This is my experience with EA's top-tier help-desk.,"This is a long post, but I just have to get it out of my system. If anyone manages to get through it all and wants to offer me a solution or emotional support i'd be glad.

I can however see my new ID in games, which is weird. I practically have two ID's, one I can change, and one I cannot change.

Hello Adam  


I have tried almost every solution to this problem, so i'm well past self-help. Searching online for my issue yields no results, so i really hope you can help me out.  


As for the why, i seem to have a bug on my account that i can't fix, and the technicians i have been in contact with at [help.ea.com](http://help.ea.com/) and over the phone have been clueless as well. 

The issue looks like this: After changing my Origin ID, the change doesn't reflect in ""My Profile"", or for my friends. They see me as an old ID from a few years back, that accidentally ended up on my profile after getting my account back after it got hacked. In games and in the rest of Origin, i see myself as my chosen ID however, which is the weird part.  


When weighing my two options; have a consistent ID all over my account and toward my friends, or keeping my progress in my games, the former outweighs the later. I would much rather have a consistent ID that actually updates when i change it, even if that means losing all my progress in games.   


My expectations for this are that my account will look like i have just bought the games. 0 play time, 0 progress, 0 achievements. I know this, but it's worth it.  


However, if there is a possibility for you guys to fix the bug, and have my ID actually update throughout my account when i change it, that would be preferable of course.   


The account that is bugged is: \*\*\*\*@hotmail.com. And if the bug is not fixable, my wish is to have my games activated on another account instead (\*\*\*\*@gmail.com), without using any merge or anything that interacts with the bugged account.  
I look forward to hearing from you again soon.

~~\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_~~

&gt;Hello A\*\*\*\* \*\*\*\*,  
&gt;  
&gt;Thanks for your response. We will not be able to move any games from the account, but please send me the username you are trying to update the account to and I can test this on my end to see if we can update it. Thanks for contacting EA Help!

Hello Adam

Ok, I hope you will be able to change it on your end. I have now changed my ID on the account to my desired ID, but i still see the issue with Origin displaying the wrong ID for my friends and in my profile. I'm including a screenshot of the issue.

https://i.redd.it/4asrrdavrng11.png

My desired ID is ""Olzar"", as it says in the bottom left corner. My friends see the wrong ID, as displayed in my profile in this screenshot. This is from [origin.com](http://origin.com/), not the app, so i'm sure it's not a bug in my system. I have also tried re-adding friends and adding new friends, but the problem stays the same.

All the best!

I have been escalated twice before reaching you, both times because they could actually see the same issue I am describing. The issue is not for this account, as this is the account I wanted to move my games TO. The account I want to move them from has the issue, hence why I initially wanted to ditch it.

I can change my ID, always was able to. The change reflects in games and on Origins welcome page but NOWHERE else.

This has been an issue for years! There is NO WAY you magically fixed it by asking me to change my ID.

I'm fed up being treated like was just born yesterday. Please try to understand the issue is on your end, and try to work with me and understand what I am describing, instead of treating me like there is nothing wrong on your end.

The bugged account that we are discussing and previous screenshot is: \*\*\*\*@hotmail.com

If you can't understand what I am describing, please call me. The handler before, who escalated me to you could see this issue just fine when we spoke on the phone.

Before sending this mail I will, just for the sake of it, check if the issue is resolved. It's still there as of now o'clock, just as it has been for several years.

PS. I know I am really rude here, and if I could tip you somehow I would. But please take this seriously, instead of guessing.

~~\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_~~

&gt;Thanks for your response. To make sure we are on the same page, I just want you to know I fully understand the issue. As long as you can update the account name it will change eventually on your friend's list. Unfortunately, this is not an issue that we would be able to move games for. I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause. Thanks again for contacting EA Help! 

~~\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_~~

This sentence right here is the cause of why I don't think you understand my issue with Origin.

""As long as you can update the account name it will change eventually on your friend's list. "" I changed my ID, and waited for two years. No change on my profile or what my friends saw my ID as. 

I changed it again, and could see the change immediately in games, but as before, but no change on my profile or what my friends saw me as. I waited for another year for my ID to change.

We are talking YEARS! What do you mean by ""it will change eventually"".

My account is obviously suffering from a bug that lies server-side.

My account being broken is not a valid reason to help me, with either fixing the bug or moving the content to a not broken account?

How about sending a code for every game on the account, and then closing the account. That way I can fix this myself.

~~\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_~~

&gt;Thanks for your response. I have reviewed your request and fully understand the issue. That being said, we are unable to transfer any content or provide you any codes for this issue because this is something that will resolve itself once you change the name in Origin after giving it time. I am going to be closing out this case again as we are considering this issue resolved. If you run into any other separate issues please do not hesitate to contact us again anytime at [help.ea.com](http://help.ea.com/). Thanks again for contacting EA Help!

Fixing this bug is as simple as making a change in a registry. It's super easy if you have access. Super hard and illegal if you don't have access.

How many more years do you suggest as an ample time to wait before this issue will sort itself out? And this question is serious, because I want to know which account I should use for Battlefield V. If we are talking less than a year, I'll stay, but if we are talking more than a year I'll just start over on a new account.  


I know you only work there, and probably has to follow the shittiest of shit-policys, but if you have the possibility can you please forward my extreme disappointment with this top-tier help. If my disappointment was breakfast, it would be Nutella.  
Your service is insulting, and having to go through this after being a loyal customer and warmly recommending origin since I was a child is surprisingly upsetting.

It has already been years, and no one has done anything to resolve this issue. I don't see how after several years with the same problem, the account will just fix itself. If you could enlighten me on that procedure I would be impressed, and if you can't I'm just assuming you think you are wizards, but not very good ones.

I'll get back to you around the release of Battlefield V if the bug is still there, which it will be. 

Could you at least forward this bug to developers and maybe it gets fixed in a future update of your systems?

If you need the bug in a simple format to forward, here it is again.

personalfinance,What Am I Getting Myself Into Using A Debt Settlement Company,"So I made contact with a company called Century Support Services. I've been trying to figure out a way to make some headway on my debt and this is seemingly a last resort.

I don't owe much ($16,000 - one loan and credit cards) but every single account has an outrageous interest rate and I haven't been able to get anywhere with the budget I've had the last few years.

After speaking with an associate who provided a tremendous amount of good information, I decided to take the plunge.

Two days later I received an offer to help settle the debt with my very first creditor. It was half of what I owe, tack on their fee and it's 3/4 of what I owe, but I'm potentially saving hundreds+ in interest.

What I'm slightly skeptical about (also waiting to hear back from the company) is how I'm going to avoid late fees, etc. from all my other creditors while this amount is being paid back. It's going to take at least 6 months to clear the first debt.

Does anyone else have experience with Century Support Services or any other debt settlement companies in general?",finance

personalfinance,"Questions about Total Disability Discharge for student loan debt, SSDI, marriage, and credit scores (US-IL)","I believe this is the best place to post this. I can cross-post this to /r/studentloans if requested, but some of the questions are more pertinent to here. Apologies if any information here is in a weird order.

My long-time girlfriend has defaulted on her Federal student loans. She owes a little under $23K, which has been sent to collections. She has no income, no cash, no open bank accounts, and no meaningful assets (unless things like clothes and random personal items count).

She has epilepsy and is currently in the process of applying for SSDI. The disability onset date filed for is January 2017. Currently she and her disability lawyer are waiting to receive a court hearing date. The lawyer appears confident that she'll get approved, given that he only receives payment out of what she receives. Part of the reason this has taken so long is because of some time wasted on our part getting to see a lawyer, though there's also the fact that we've been waiting to be notified of a court date for quite a few months now. She's kept in touch with her lawyer and he's instructed us to keep waiting.

The way she lives having no income or assets is by living with me. Her name is not on the lease of our apartment. I make $56K/year and have not been claiming her as dependent on my taxes so she continues to be eligible for Medicaid. My understanding is that she will be eligible for Medicare about getting approved for SSDI.

I've recently been made aware that TPD is a thing that exists to discharge her debt, and would like her to apply to it upon getting approved for her SSDI

______________________________

My questions are the following:

* Am I correct in thinking that she'd likely be eligible for a TPD upon receiving SSDI approval? Is there any other resource avenues I should be aware of?

* Am I correct in thinking that her SSDI and subsequent Medicare eligibility would both not be affected by us getting married? Google says I am, but sanity checks are nice.

* Would getting married affect her TPD within the 3 year ""monitoring"" period? Again, google seems to say no, but I'm not 100% sure.

* A more general question: How exactly does getting married effect our credit scores, it at all? Google results seem inconsistent. I see some results suggesting that our credit scores sort of magically merge if we open a joint account together, which I think refers to joint bank/credit accounts? My credit score is about 790 or so, I *assume* hers is terrible given the defaulted loan. Would a TPD improve her credit? My current intention is to buy a house before getting married so I can lock myself into a better mortgage rate.

___________________________

Other potentially relevant side information comments that I neglected to include above:

* We're both fine with waiting to get married until everything makes sense financially.

* My credit history includes: A single credit card that I've had for about 6 years which I use to make a small purchase and pay off in full every month ; A 5 year car loan that I'm currently 2 years into paying off ; My rent which I've been paying 2 years without a missed payment

* I myself have no student debt. I am instead re-paying my parents a monthly percentage of my income.

* She has had medical debt in the past, but has since paid it all off.

personalfinance,Underwater car loan with costly repairs,"So, the wife made an outrageous purchase last year.  It was a 2007 GMC Acadia with 100K miles on it.  She not only over paid for it...she financed it for 6 years at an 18% interest rate.  To say we are under water is an understatement.

Now we are having mechanical issues.  Fuel injectors, o2 sensors, etc... This model has a history with transmission/propulsion problems also.  I fully expect to have those issues pop up in a couple of years. 

We have TERRIBLE credit, so biting the bullet and just financing the difference in a different car isn't an option.  As if a bank would do that anyway.  I am not certain how she got it financed in the first place.

Again...my credit is AWFUL.  The good news?  We bring in a good chunk of change and do not have any major debt.  No mortgage/low rent.  She does have a student loan payment, but she is on the home stretch for that.

Does voluntary repossession make any sense?  For the record, I don't think my credit score could get much lower.

With this new refinance, my payments will only be going up by about $60/month, but I’ll be at a lower interest rate and cut my term in half.  I have some other debt that will be paid off &lt;4 years so following that I’ll start aggressively tackling this debt. In the mean time, tax returns and extra money I come into here and there gets thrown at the loan, on top of my normal monthly savings.

CryptoCurrency,Binance. A wolf in a sheep's clothing?,"Exchange listings are one of the prevalent points of discussion amongst projects and communities. It’s not uncommon for questions to be asked, and rumors to fly. A recent ‘discussion’ on Twitter, highlights a need that is common throughout the space. Transparency. Business or not (both coins and exchanges), share a common responsibility in terms of helping crypto move forward. Below is a ‘Twitterlogue’, which gives a chance to discuss issues that we are facing, and how to progress.    

Christopher Franko - CF - Co Founder of Expanse
Changpeng Zhao - CZ - Ceo Binance 

CF - “Just got a new Binance listing quote. 400BTC.”

CZ - “We don't list shitcoins even if they pay 400 or 4,000           BTC...”
      - “Also, the email Franko showed is a spoofed/scam email…”

Cf - “You are a fucking liar. It's that simple.”

CZ - “ All complaints about listing fee come from projects we did not list, ie, did not charge (did not even ask for a fee)...” 

Questionable Binance listings: 
 - Bytecoin (dubious?)
 - Skycoin (dubious?)
 - Quarkchain (Questionable, although trading was postponed after a 
    community members due diligence) 


This is simply an example, and Binance is in no way the sole exchange asking for a listing fee, or (not?) listing shitcoins. But this highlights something that has become more evident of late: the need for due diligence, not just from ICOs and their early stage investors, but also exchanges, (even the ones that claim) to do their due diligence on coins being listed. 

How do these mistakes happen? And who is to blame? 
Is it the projects, for paying the listing fee? The exchanges, for charging the listing fee? Or the communities, for demanding the listing fee be paid? 
In a space mostly void of regulation, it’s important for all parties involved to take responsibilit.

We hereby present an open invitation to anyone looking to discuss the elephant in the room.

CryptoCurrency,The Death of Bitcoin.,"[Piramid with like...an eye and some letters in some foreign language...](https://i.redd.it/kzutemrt6pg11.jpg)

Let me tell you a story.

Let's imagine that one day a monopolistic financial organism such as the the...oh… Federal Reserve of The United States realizes that Bitcoin and Crypto have the potential to undermine its hegemony, and end its hundred years of financial reign across most of the western world.

It is quite clear by now that the FED and other similar central banks of the world have the ability to 'print' (writing zeros and ones on a computer) money at will...out of thin air and in any quantity. Obviously pushing obscene amounts of money into the real economy is not realistic as they are restricted by palpable inflation and huge sums cannot be sent into circulation all at once as the market will feel it immediately in price hikes and destabilization of the economy. So in the FIAT market they have to do it with finesse. However in crypto-land they can play by different rules...

Here's what they'll do:

The FED will probably decide to 'print' money in a CLOSED LOOP, in house, off the books money which will never see the light of day and be accounted for. That money will never be poured onto the streets. That money is made to be transferred straight from their basement into the exchanges. They will then set up a few hundreds maybe even thousands fake accounts on crypto exchanges through which they will begin to slowly BUY...and BUY... Bitcoin and alts. They will do this for years so the market won't notice. They will 'print' enough dollars...any theoretical sum until they buy up that magic 51 percent...hell even 99 PERCENT of the BICOIN SUPPLY!!!

And nobody will ever notice ... as remember, that fake printed money would not pass through the normal market...it would go straight from the FED into a made up BANK, then into Bitcoin.

And then one day when they decide it's time...THEY DUMP IT! The whole market....TRILLIONS of dollars gone in a flash! Diluted...

And they dollars they make back? They burn it by pressing delete. They don't need it anyway, the plan worked and the FIAT system gets too keep it's planetary scale monopoly board intact. They keep controlling the trade wars for the next hundred years. They keep controlling the nation states and the energy….and in the words of Nathan Rothschild will still ring true for the centuries to come:

""Let us control the money of a country, and we care not who makes its laws.""

And out of the ashes of the markets, shell-shocked, nobody will understand how BITCOIN was killed and why...

We will be stuck baffled and with the questions- Why, why did the markets react so abruptly to that (made up random) event?! The charts were sound...I did my due diligence...I followed McAfee on Twitter...I did everything right!!...

And in tears we'll be holding the bags and scars of the biggest CRASH in History folks.

It will no doubt have ripples into the FIAT economy but those will pass, and the all mighty FIAT will rein king again...

And thus, this is my question to you,

Could this be done?

Is there any way to prevent it?

Now you might say:

1 Hey buddy the exchanges will notice strange activity!

2 It’s too big of a conspiracy, too many people have to be involved and it will leak

3 This is bull\*hit…exchanges monitors and crypto trackers will see bad actors, exchanges they have 2FA and you have to send them your passport and a picture of your dog to get in!

4 Screw this conspiracy junk...I'm buyin' more o' dat sweet Ripple, Tron, and BitConnect…''we gonna make all kinds a' gains!''

personalfinance,[Texas] Homebuying for 2nd(ish) house,"So I'm wondering if there is a way to save on the following situation, or what rules might apply. A few years back, I bought a house with the intention of being there for 5-10 years, then moving onto whatever comes next. The market was pretty hot, but I managed to get a great deal through (seller was a hoarder, etc) with really low interest rate. It has been literally years of working on the weekends to get the house into ""marketable"" shape, and done up how I would like it to be (just have a laundry room left to do!)

Fast forward a few years, my gf at the time and I became far more serious and got married (this can happen sometimes haha), and now my plan of being in my current location is a bit more tough as I will be traveling for work, and the house is pretty far out for her to commute everyday. With a new combined income, we have found a few places closer that could work for her.

I don't want to sell my current location because I've put in a lot of work, interest rate is crazy low, and I think I could make money off of it as a rental (and its a neighborhood far more conducive to families than say crazy college students or wacko's... I hope...) That said, is there any way to leverage the fact that my wife wasn't on the original mortgage at all to get first time homebuyer benefits? Or is the fact that I would be on the 2nd house kill any chance of that (with Texas being a common property state, I technically have to be on the title whether I wanted to or not)?",finance

solar,"Question about solar proposal (Orlando, FL)","Hi guys, first time poster in this sub.
My dad is considering installing solar on his house, and asked my thoughts about the proposal he got from a company called Go Solar. The truth is that I don't know anything about this topic until yesterday that he showed me the proposal and I lurked a little bit over this sub. So, can you guys give me your opinion on this?

[Here](https://imgur.com/a/1E15bI9) is what my dad's house energy consumption looks like. (Duke Energy)

In their proposal they came up with these numbers:

Estimated current avg. Bill: $149
Estimated current annual utility bill: $1782
Estimated annual utility price escalator: 4%
Estimated projected 25-year cost: $74229

Then they talked about the equipment:

Solar System Details:

Size: 7.83 kW
Estimated year 1 production: 11760 kWh

Equipment:

27 S-Energy SN290M-10 (panels)
27 Enphase Energy IQ7-60-2-US (inverters)
1 Enphase Envoy-S Monitoring

System cost:
$25213

Then, the loan:

Monthly loan payment: $121
Loan term: 20 years
Down payment: $0
Interest rate. 4.99%
Interest rate increase: 0%
Estimated savings over 25 years: $36825

Now, after reading a little bit in this sub, I think my dad might have gotten the wrong idea of how this works (or the seller might have tried to sell him something nonetheless). But, my dad is assuming that if power fails for some reason, (hurricane for instance) he would able to use whatever he might have generated using this equipment (please correct if I'm wrong, but there is nothing mentioning batteries or storage in this proposal). So, at the end what do you guys think about all of this situation?

What are the facts about this? Is is a good investment/proposal for the future (even though that he might not used it in emergencies)

Is this a good company to work with? What others would you consider for something like this in this area? My dad's zipcode is 34786.

My dad has a great credit score. What do you guys think about the interest rate and the loan plan?

In terms of insurance policy, they said that they are responsible for installation problems for the first 5 years and equipment malfuncion for 20 years (Im not sure about this one)

Thanks for reading. I hope I can get some good insights about this and advice my dad. Thank you",energy

BlockChain,A rough idea: A Remix of Self-Sovereign-Identity to Yield Universal Basic Income,"I would like to start a discussion regarding a rough idea I had bit ago. This is not a presentation of a polished idea. There is much to unpack here, and I am sharing these thoughts to get a discussion going. I am interested in peoples thoughts in general, and would appreciate both destructive and constructive criticism. For example, while I will appreciate an opinion along the lines of “that won’t work and here is why”, I am also interested in alternatives that would work and why they would.

The goal is to come up with a scheme that yields universal basic income for the citizenry and also does not require government funds but instead plans that the private sector pay for it. At the same time, that same private sector is making money too. In other words, a win-win. So here goes the draft I have:

First, imagine the government passed a law proclaiming that the only legal way for the private sector to utilize citizenry data is by buying permission to do so from the citizenry.

Now the governing body of the collective user data could be a new department within the federal government, or there could be a quasi-governmental agency, maybe a citizens union that is held accountable legally. Lets call this governing body the “Union”.

The citizenry could openly disclose any data they want. Still, that data cannot be used commercially / for profit unless it is attained via the Union, and is subject to contract terms (length of time that data can be used for, etc.).

The private sector, in order to use this data that can drive R&amp;D and thus increase profit (etc.), must buy this data from the Union. Furthermore, the Union, via the contract terms, can decide what the limits on “freedom of use” would be, and can either ensure that certain uses are completely off limits (legally speaking), and can produce different price points for different (anonymized) data sets.

The Union would house the data securely. This data could be housed in a public blockchain whose on-chain data is the encrypted version of the citizenry data. This could be decrypted using some authentication specific to each individual?

Each person, from birth, has stake in this Union, since their data is protected therein.

The money generated from this endeavor could be used to produce a sort of universal basic income for the citizenry.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,So you want to buy an automobile? Here are some TIPS.,"I recently financed a new car and here are some of the things that I learned:

1) Know what you want before arriving at dealership - Many times people show up hoping the car dealer will pick a good car for them but this is a great way to overpay. Look up what you’re interested in and find a vehicle that you like and look at the dealer websites to see if they have what you want there and if the price fits. It’s also good to look at several dealer websites to see what deals you can get so when it’s time to negotiate and they’re not budging on the price, you can tell them “I can get a better deal at this dealership” and more than likely they’ll be willing to lower the price.

2) Discuss down payment AFTER you agree on a price - Many times salespeople try to get you hooked on a car you can’t afford by offering you low monthly payments. Always look at the final price and if they keep speaking about monthly payments then keep telling them that your more concerned with the final cost.

3) Know the worth of your trade-in (if applicable) - Always look up how much your car is worth before discussing a trade at any dealership or places such as Carmax. This can help you know what your car is worth and helps make sure you get what your car is valued at. It’s very possible that they’ll offer you less than it’s worth since they need to make a profit on the vehicle as well but this is more to have a rough idea on how much you’re expecting.

4) Look at official websites for promotions - This can save you money in the long run. A lot of times there are rebates for recent college grads, military, or whatever the case may be. This can help with the overall cost and sometimes you can get a promotion interest rate that’s a lot lower than most banks. I’d recommend to discuss this after agreeing on final price as well.

5) It’s not over until AFTER the finance office visit - Many people have this idea that car salespeople are the scum of the earth. Now that may be the truth in some cases but in my experiences the people in the finance office are even bigger snakes. They will try to add features or extended warranties w/o your consent at times. To me, the only thing that’s worth purchasing is GAP insurance but that’s usually available with whoever you finance with and just know that if you finance through their bank it’ll be more expensive. Even after the visit, look at your contract and what you signed to make sure you didn’t miss anything and if you did miss something it’ll be okay, you go back there and ask to be refunded. They will keep on trying to tell you why you need it but you need to put your foot down and say NO (unless you want it). If they refuse, you can always submit a complaint to the Better Business Bureau and look at other state laws cause this is considered auto fraud. Never pay for something you don’t want.


I’m sure there are other tips out there but here are some that I thought were very important. Just be ready to walk away on a deal that you don’t think is worth it and make sure that you have time because buying a new car takes a lot of patience. Feel free to add more!",finance

My family and I have been struggling to find a rental in the timeline our landlord gave us, and so knowing my boss has several rental properties, asked him if there was anything he had available.    It's not a situation I'm extremely comfortable with, but I figured we could go month to month, as a way to extend the time we had to find a place that doesn't mean my boss is also my landlord.

He has a larger modular home on a piece of property that is the idea size and layout for us.  It's in good condition, is on a fair sized piece of property, and has amenities we were excited about.   The catch, he doesn't want to rent it to me, he wants me to buy it.  I told him that we were renting right now as a way to fix our credit and save up to re-enter the housing market in 5 years or so, so we didn't have money for a down payment.

He said he would put up the 20% down payment, and we'd be 80/20 co-owners until we either bought him out, or if we sold the place he got his 20% plus 20% of the net equity back.

Where we're struggling now, is that the home has been moved twice, which eliminates a lot of financing options.   What I've been initially told is that we can either go the VA route, or get a conventional 20 year loan with an 8% interest rate, but they're looking for a higher credit score than what we have.

Neither my wife or I were in the military, so VA is out (her dad is, but he already has a loan so he can't be the signatory), and even if we had a cosigner for the credit score, they'd still look at ours as the primary score in determining whether or not to do the loan.

My questions are this:

1. Is this sounding like a weird deal to anyone else?
2. The payment based on a 20 year loan for the price of the home at 8% is still about half what rent would cost us, so we're not too worried about that.  Will that possibly help with approval on a conventional loan if our credit score is lower than their preferred minimum?
3. Are there any other loan options that someone may know of that would work for a twice moved modular home in WA state?
4. I tried to look at VA loan entitlement limits in regarding my wife's father signing for us, and I don't consider myself a stupid man, but I could not figure out how those are tabulated.   Does someone have an ELI5 version of that?

Thank you in advance for any guidance on this.",finance
personalfinance,Asking for help in organizing/prioritizing my financial goals,"I am a 22yo about to graduate college and will start my first “real” job in September. I want to make sure I’m handling my money responsibly: paying off debt, saving for retirement, but also enjoying it as well.

I have roughly 104K in student loans (weighted avg interest rate of 6.19%), but no other debt. I’m starting out with a salary of 95k and will rent an apartment with 2 roommates in a HCOL area. I own a car (Honda Accord with 160K miles) that’s in decent condition and have no plans to replace it any time soon.

**My main question is: How do I balance all of my goals in terms of saving and paying off debt?** I've broken down my planned monthly income/expenses and have also listed my financial goals along with some specific questions about each. Hopefully everything here makes sense. Any feedback/advice is appreciated.

**INCOME**
~$5500/month

**MONTHLY EXPENSES** (conservative estimates)

 * Rent: $850
 * Utilities: $150
 * Groceries/Restaurants: $400
 * Car insurance: $150
 * Gas: $50
 * Renters insurance: $30
 * Gym: $40
 * Student Loans: $1150
 * Extras/Fun Money: $200
 * Total: $3020

So basically the main question is: how should I use the remaining $2480?

**EMERGENCY FUND**
Goal: $18000
Should I slowly build this fund up or dedicate all savings to it until it’s built up?

**DEBT**
Goal: Pay off $104k in student loans.
My monthly payment is $1150, but I would love to throw more money at it each month in order to pay off the debt faster. How much more is reasonable?

**RETIREMENT**
Goal: Start saving something?
My employer does no matching at all on my 401k. Does this mean I should open my own Roth IRA because of the additional benefit of not having to pay taxes on the money when I retire? Or should I do some sort of combination of both? Also, how much money should I be contributing?

Thanks for reading.

I am currently thinking the REPAY, income based plan, makes the most sense as an option and just make minimum payments until 47 years old (ouch).  If I throw all my emergency funds at this, should I target the highest interest loans (technically my parents can offer emergency financial buffer, but can't really substantially contribute to my loans)?

personalfinance,Debt repayment,"Does anyone here have any experience with taking out a personal loan to pay off higher interest rate credit cards and such? 

I’m personally in an ok position. I have some student loans that I’m paying already while still in school.

I give them all my money I have left after my bills but I can’t possibly work more.

financialindependence,NY Fed: Household Debt,"The New York Fed released a report earlier this year showing an [increase in US household debt](https://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/news/research/2018/rp180517).

Not too shocking given a healthy economy for the better part of 10 years. Consumers usually relax their frugal muscles after awhile and swap long term memory for short term. The report has some interesting takeaways though. The most jarring of which has to be the student loan numbers. Many of us know how serious the situation has become recently, anecdotally or otherwise.

Student loan debt is now accountable for $1.41 Trillion of US household debt. That's second only to mortgage debt ($8.9 Trillion). The really fun numbers come into play when we look at the percentage of loans in ""serious delinquency"". This indicates loans that are more than 90 days behind, which applies to 8.9% of student loans. Almost 9% of these non-dischargeable, tax-payer backed debts are significantly behind.

Roughly half of SL debt is in deferment currently. Meaning, 8.9% of the total outstanding is seriously delinquent but roughly 17.8% of those in repayment meet this criteria.

If any other part of our financial system had an almost 1/5 chance of being in serious danger of recouping its outlay, it would be a national crisis until it was fixed. This report highlights a few key stats to keep in mind about the current state of American households, the most glaring being that the 2nd highest contributor to personal debt is seeing consistently terrible repayment figures.

We'll have to wait and see how this works out. The numbers have been worse in past years but touting that is like being proud that you put out 10% of a fire. Depending on the situation, there could be serious economic implications for future portfolio returns if catastrophic failure occurs.",finance

personalfinance,Balance transfer to a new card as back up?,"I’m posting here because I’m desperate for advice on how to best handle my current debt situation. 

I currently have a 7k personal loan, which I’d used to pay off my credit cards and had planned to refrain from using them and pay them off. I also currently owe about 13k on my car loan. This information isn’t the current issue, I’m just adding this in here for background if it helps at all. I can handle the payments for both of these perfectly fine.

The issue at hand is that I owe ~$4650 on my chase credit card, on top of everything else. It has a 0% APR until March 2019. Until now, I’d completely ignored it. No excuse, I understand. I made a series of poor decisions, vet bills, and car trouble and it got me in this situation. Mainly stupid decisions. 

I’m now at a point in my life where paying this is going to become my number one focus, as it’s stressed me out for far too long. If I can manage to pick up the overtime I’m planning on picking up at work, I’ll have about $800 extra a month to help with this. If that all goes as planned, it would take me six months to pay it down. I’ve been searching online as well to look for ways to make money and I’ve started a bit on mturk.

My question I guess is that if all does not go as planned and I still owe a substantial amount of money towards this card when March comes (interest rate over 22%), can I theoretically open a new card with a 0% APR rate and transfer the balance there until I can pay it off? My credit rate is in the 700s, if that helps. Will I have to pay anything if the card I’m transferring to has a 0% balance transfer intro rate? 

I have every intention to try everything in my means to pay this off before March, I’m asking more as a back up in case the time comes. Trying to develop a plan here so that I can stress less. I’ve already cut as many of my bills down as I realistically can.

I apologies for all the details I’m just very confused on what to do and all of the details so I’m hoping for more clarification and help. I understand that I’ve made poor decisions, and I’m looking for ways to help dig myself out of this hole before it gets too late.

TLDR; I have a credit card with a 0% intro interest rate that turns to a 22+% in March. Can I open a new 0% intro card and transfer the balance if need be? 

EDIT: I forgot to mention that due to getting 3 pays in August I will be devoting one of my paychecks to pay this down, effectively making it 3650 instead of 4650.",finance
investing,Is physical Real Estate Investing really that great an investment?,"Buying real estate is really cash intensive with higher than average expenses. I hope this sparks a great discussion.

At best you have no HOA, a no property tax, no to low maintenance, and that leaves the growth/performance.

At worst, you have an HOA hurdle, property taxes, and some maintenance, all of which can push your annual expense ratio up towards 3%! If offered a mutual fund with a 3% expense ratio, most would balk!

Even without any debt against the house, real estate seems to price inversely proportionally to interest rates. Like an existing bond trading below par when rates rise.

So what makes physical real estate more attractive than an investment portfolio.

Some people have a just ""real estate only"" mentality but it seems most indexes show real estate performance around 10% long term, does that count the property taxes and HOAs and taxes on gains and rent being taxable as well?",finance

I’m trying to find a logical balance between paying debt/retirement/emergency fund.

* **Student Loan Debt:** 150k @ 6.5% interest, federal
* **Savings:** 10k 
* **401k:** 15k 

My take home is $7350 and I plan to throw $3500 per month at the loans and cash my RSUs out as they vest, applying the lump sum to the loans. At current stock valuation this schedule would put my target loan payoff date sometime around October 2021. 

I’ll be 33 when I pay the loans off. I fully realize that I have massively negative net worth and I am responsible for digging myself out of this hole.

personalfinance,"Internet account sent to collections, account wasnt even mine! Account belonged to my company, but the internet company had my name and sent me to collections. What does this mean for my credit?","So my question is a bit of a mix between both r/legal advice and r/personalfinance. I've posted to legal advice already, but I would also like a financial take as well. Here is what is happening:

So my job is a bit demanding, and last year (October) I got sent away for approximately 6-8 weeks for a project. Instead of keeping me in a hotel, my company had rented an apartment for me to stay in. This included setting up tv/internet for the place since I needed internet to do my job. My company provides everything for us when this happens so there was no account for anything set up with the expectation of me to pay.

Once I was there, my name was given to the internet company since I was the person that would be at the residence to let the technician in to hook up services. I thought all was good and well when, at the end of it all, I returned the equipment to the company and went on my merry way.

It's now nearly a year later, and I have found out that I personally have been sent to collections by this internet company for a bill that was not paid by my company (it was mailed to the address I moved out of and not to my company accounting team, so we didn't even know it existed). Every time I call collections I get the runaround about how they will only speak to me because it's my name and phone number on the account, even though I keep trying to tell them it isn't my account at all. They're calling me and going after me because somehow it's only my name and number they have.

The thing is, I never paid for or called for anything to do with this. It was totally my Companys account financially. There was no expectations for me to pay for it and I didn't pay for it while I was there. As far as my company is concerned they closed the account paid in full. I'm also curious how the previous bills made it to the correct place (my company accounting team) but all of a sudden they don't have that information.

When I called the tv/internet company, they are saying that since I allowed the technician in, I am responsible for the outstanding fees. They believe that since I was the end user, I'm fully responsible and my credit is now going to take a hit because my name and number is what they had for the technician to contact.

My legal question is, how can someone else (re: my company) set up an account totally in my name, without my permission or signature or anything, and have me sent to collections for unpaid bills?? I'm not understanding something here. I asked the internet company how they can allow someone to set up something like that totally in my name, and they are currently going back to listen to calls and see what happened. I want to be prepared before they call because as far as I'm concerned I did not sign up for this account.

My personal finance questions are, how can I fight this and keep it off my credit record? I've never been sent to collections in my life, and I ALWAYS make payments on time. I've never missed one ever and I take pride in having a good score. This isn't my personal account so I'm livid that I'm taking the hit for something like this.

To be totally fair to my company, I believe that they did everything they could to avoid this, I think the internet company effed up here big time. My company did not intend for me to get caught in the cross fire here.

Is there anything I should know going into this? I'm prepared to fight this hard but I want to know my standing here, and what the risks are for me financially.

If this helps, I'm located in Canada.",finance

So, I am really trying to figured out if Student load debt consolidation place is scamming me or not. looked at the BBB and had no rating (which doesn't make me comfortable).

personalfinance,Tax adjusted net worth - is 401k money overestimating true net worth?,"A dollar in a taxable account with no gains on it is worth more than a dollar in a 401k account. The reason for this is obvious:
  
1) you must pay state + local taxes to withdraw money as it's treated as income. This could easily be 30% or more. If you need to take a large chunk out and/or you already have a large income the taxes could be a lot more. I think many on this forum underestimate how much income they will have in retirement. 
2) you are subject to a 10% penalty if you withdraw before 59.5
3) waiting until 59.5 has downsides as well. Time is money. You might want to use that money before that but cant due to the penalty. Time value of money comes into play here.

When calculating net worth, just summing up all accounts without taking into consideration taxes and account type is being a bit disingenuous, especially with 401k money that is subject to a lot of taxes. After all, having 1M in a 401k account isn't nearly as useful as having 1M in a taxable account.

I think its more important to consider tax adjusted net worth. Which would be how much you'd have if you had to liquidate and pay taxes on all gains. For 401k money, to make things easier only discount by your current tax bracket. Do not consider the 10% penalty and the step up in tax bracket as you take more money out. Consider those 2 as equivalent trade offs for the tax free growth. For house equity, consider the capital gains tax exclusion of 500k for a married couple on a primary residence. 

for example consider the following person with a traditionally calculated net worth of 1.5M with each bucket representing 1/3rd

500k taxable (50% of it is gains all long term)  
500k 401k  
500k home equity  

consider a typical upper middle class higher income earner with a terminal tax bracket of 32% + 5% state = 37%  

tax adjusted assets:  
taxable - 450k (long term cap gains of 15% federal + 5% state on 250k)  
401k - 315k  
home equity - 475k (favorable tax treatment but assume 5% transaction costs)  

total: 1.240M",finance
personalfinance,Moving to France from the US,"Hi everyone!

I am a 28F green card holder (French citizen) and my husband is a 32M US citizen.
After living together in the US for 2.5 years, we have decided to move to France for at least 2 years to see which country works best for us and where we would like to raise our future children.
I am starting a job in France in September and my husband will join me in January 2019.

I have a few questions regarding our “expatriation” and would really appreciate any feedback/comments:


1) Checking/Saving accounts: 

We currently have checking/saving accounts with BoA and a saving account with Discover.
I don’t think I will need to wire or withdraw money from these accounts in France (as I already have some funds in France and should be paid enough for the both of us to live comfortably).

What should we do? Put everything in a high interest rate saving account? Would you recommend a specific bank?


2) Credit card:

We only have one credit card with discover at the moment.
Should I keep it active even though we won’t use it?
Is there another cc you would recommend? I read about the Capital One Quicksilver card that does not have any foreign transaction fee, but once again I don’t think we would use it much..


3) 401K:

I have almost 20K in my Fidelity 401K right now (my husband only have 1.5K with T Rowe Price).
Should we just leave it as 401K or should we roll it into an IRA? 


4) IBA:
My husband has an IBA with Vanguard that his grand parents set up for him a few years ago. Can he keeps it as is or do we have to make any changes?


5) Tax filling:
I have no idea how I will prepare my 2018 taxes yet.. I know that I will request help from a professional service so if you have any recommendations, I will be more than happy to hear them!


PS: I am planning on giving up my green card by the beginning of 2019 (i don’t want to do it right away as I want to be sure the job works out first (in France there is a 3 month “trial” period where the company can fire you for any reasons)).


Thank you all for reading and your recommendations!
Let me know if you need more details.

personalfinance,I am shocked at these interest rates,"My wife and I applied for a personal loan to consolidate credit cards.  We were quoted at 10% (she quoted us high in case, lower end is 7.5%).  We applied for a HEIL as we have some equity in our house 85% LTV and went through Navy Federal Credit Union.  They do LTV up to 100%, came back at almost 13%!!!  I know my wife's credit is in the lower 700's and mine is in the upper 700's.  But 13% is absolutely insane.  I have no idea how a secure loan is a higher rate than a nonsecure loan.",finance
personalfinance,Should I use savings to pay off overdraft?,"Hi r/personalfinance! 

I'm a recent graduate and am pretty far into my £2,000 (interest and fee free) overdraft. I have a full time job, but I've recently relocated and have had issues with my car, so it's been an expensive few months. 

The only savings I have are in a Help To Buy ISA (I'm in the UK) which I'm using to save to buy a house - however I don't see myself reaching that stage for at least another 4-5 years. The ISA has a 2% interest rate, you can deposit a maximum of £200 into the ISA per calendar month, and the UK government will boost your savings by 25% when you're ready to buy a house. So suppose I save £8,000, the government will give me £2,000 so I have a deposit of £10,000. 

I have enough money in my HTB ISA to pay off my overdraft completely. My monthly outgoings (including saving £200 in the HTB ISA) are roughly similar to my monthly take home income at the moment. 

I see my options as:

1. Transfer £2000 from my HTB ISA into my current account to pay off the overdraft. Then I always have a positive current account balance, and can continue depositing £200 into my HTB ISA each month. 
2. Stop depositing £200 per month into my HTB ISA and slowly pay off the overdraft (will take around 9-10 months). 
3. Continue depositing £200 per month into my HTB ISA, and remain deep into my overdraft. There are no fees or interest on the overdraft for the next 12 months, then the fee-free overdraft amount reduces to £1,500. 

Any advice would be much appreciated!",finance
personalfinance,Paying Debt While Cash Flowing School,"I'm wondering what the best plan of attack for my debt is. I currently owe $12,000 (with this upcoming school year included) and going into my third year of college. There are 2 private loans I took out my freshman year, totaling $2,200. The rest are federal. I earn $120/week while at school and this summer I am earning $660/week at an internship. Last summer I earned $200/week. Each week I pay $50 towards my private loans. My unsubsidized federal loans I pay $25/month to avoid the interest. The rest of my money I use to cash flow the difference left for school. In total I'm accruing about $6,000/year in debt and have 1 more year to go. I will graduate with about $18,000 assuming I don't make any payments which I am doing. Is this a good way to tackle this debt?

personalfinance,Switching to a minimalist lifestyle actually works,"Hey guys, first off, I appreciate people in this subreddit that have helped me in the past year. I was about 6,000 in debt, which wasn't the main issue, the fact was I was basically living paycheck-to-paycheck on a $2,000 a month salary because of my senseless spending habits.

What sparked this was a situation I was in a few months ago. A fire had started in the forrest behind my home while I was at work. My brother called me and said, ""The fire department is evacuating the neighborhood. What do you want from your room?"" the only things I asked him to grab was my 35mm film exposures, my computer hard drives, a stuffed animal I got when I was a child, and a painting given to me by my great grandfather. Fortunately the fire department contained the fire before anyone lost their homes. And it made me think alot about what kind of connection I have had with material things. The overall value of what I asked my brother to grab was maybe $200.
The next week I went out and bought several clear tubs put everything in there I didn't need. Soon after I finally had the courage to sell, donate, or trash it all. 

After that, I started taking a serious interest in minimal lifestyle living. And honestly, at first I thought this was some weird movement that saves you a couple hundred bucks, but I can't tell you what it's like spending $1000 a month and living comfy.

I have paid off more than half of my credit card bill. I ended every single subscription I had, except for Amazon Prime student, that's a neat little trick I learned is enrolling at community colleges to get student discounts on pretty much anything. You don't even have to take classes, just pay the $25 enrollment fee.It's such a nice sensation of knowing that little bits of money aren't being drawn out of my account every other day. I like coming home to a room that isn't cluttered anymore, I love looking at my bank account now, and challenging myself to see how little I can actually spend.

 I know it's a little unfair considering I don't have to factor in paying rent, or a car payment, I managed to pay my car off 6 months ago and my condo was an inheritance from a family member. I am beyond grateful for this, otherwise I don't know how I would have managed to live with my awful habits. 

I think the minimalists has one of the easiest guides videos on the topic. It's definitely worth taking a look if you've always thought about it or wanted to learn more.

I now have 300 items in my possession, I couldn't sacrifice my shoes and my clothes, that's my only vice. Otherwise I'd be an owner of only 60 or so items.

personalfinance,Mom has concerns about transferring my car title to my name only,"My mom cosigned on my car loan when I was in the last year of college because I didn't have established credit and she offered to make the payments until I graduated. I paid off the rest of the loan in lump sum once I tried to redo the loan in just my name and the interest rate was about to double. Anyway, she is still the main name on the loan and I asked her if we could transfer the title to me. She said it better to leave it as is in case something happened to me so it wouldn't get held up in probate processing. She said I should also probably put my dad (they are divorced, so doesn't seem schemey) on my bank accounts too for the same reason.

For some reason I really didn't like that answer. Maybe because she's pulling the same thing with her boyfriend's boat. I came her to either see if I'm overreacting or figure out how to handle this. Maybe establish a will? Any advice is appreciated.",finance
personalfinance,Tax Questions About Purchasing a Home,"Hi - this is a throwaway account. Sorry if these are stupid questions, but I couldn't find a definite answer online. Maybe that's because they're stupid, but I thought I'd ask this forum anyways.

I'm a grad student moving to Southern California. Due to the price of rent in my area, my family has decided to purchase a home instead both as an investment and as a substitute for having to pay $15,000-$20,000 a year for rent. 

My parents made an offer for a property that was accepted. However, because they are not living there, the property counts as an investment property, which means the rate on our loan is slightly higher. In addition to this, my parents believe that their financial bracket does not allow them to claim any tax benefits on the loan.

I have several questions about this.

* Is it possible for me to co-sign the offer with one of my parents, have them take out the loan, and then claim the tax benefits for myself?

* If I want to claim tax benefits, does this mean I would have to take out the loan? If so, would the rate likely be much higher? My credit is good and I had paid internships, but I never had a salaried position in my employment history. Would co-signing a loan be my best option here in order to both claim benefits and get a lower rate?

* If I co-sign for the home, would the property still be classified as an investment property?

* Are there any significant benefits or consequences of using delayed financing in order to close the purchase faster? The interest rate is only different by about ~0.15%

* If I should be co-signing for the property, could my parents simply have an agent draw up a contract for me to ""replace"" one of them, or would we have to back out and sign a new offer with the seller?

Any advice or answers to these questions are appreciated! Thank you for reading and for your help in advance!",finance
personalfinance,Refinancing a significant amount of federal loans and private loans and my three options,"Hello /r/personalfinance, I've heard really great things about this place. I'm in an uncomfortable situation as it is. I have $77,622.42 in student loans, spread throughout unsubsidized student loans, subsidized student loans, and private loans through Sallie Mae.

Some information about me:

Age: 23 recent undergraduate

Yearly Salary: $72,500 come September 2018

Rent: $1150/month

GOAL: Pay off debt as soon as possible

Here is an overview of how many loans I have oustanding

FEDERAL LOANS:

|Loan Type|Interest Rate|Outstanding Principal|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Unsub. #1|4.45%|$2,000|
|Subs. #1|4.45%|$5,500|
|Unsubs. #2|3.76%|$2,000|

|Unsubs. #4|4.66%|$2,000|
|Subs. #4|4.66%|$3,500|
||**TOTAL**|**$27,000**|

PRIVATE LOANS:

|Sallie Mae Loan|Interest Rate|Outstanding Principal|

|\#5|4.120%|$1,675.12|
||**TOTAL**|**$50,622.42**|

From my research, it would be my best interest to refinance the private Sallie Mae loans to reduce the high interest on those loans. However, I am really not sure how to approach this in aggregate. Should I leave the federal loans as is, or pool them into a refinanced loan with my Sallie Mae loans? I would assume it would depend on that refinanced loan's interest rate, in which I'll have to get quotes. Ultimately, what should I do with those federal loans? I'd appreciate any advice on this. I am aware that if I do refinance privately, then I will lose some federal benefits, with one standing out amongst the others, which is the income driven repayment. If my goal is to get these loans aid off as soon as possible, would it be irrelevant of me to worry about losing this benefit?

To summarize, I feel like I have three options, and I don't even know how to begin weighing them appropriately.

1) Refinance all of my loans under the same umbrella and lose federal benefits

2) Only refinance the Sallie Mae loans and leave the federal loans as is

3) Direct consolidation of my federal loans and then refinance my Sallie Mae loans elsewhere

I was also thinking about where to get this refinancing accomplished. I have had good experiences with my bank, so I was thinking about doing it through them. I have also read good things about SiFo, so I was also considering them, too.",finance
personalfinance,Federal withholdings question,[deleted],finance
personalfinance,How do I convince myself to buy a cheaper car?,"Hi all,

I just graduated from a nice college with a nice degree and landed myself a job in the tech industry in California. I've lived without a car in college and got by just fine, but now that I'm a fully functional professional adult, I'm weighing my options in terms of car ownership.

But here's the thing. I'm a car guy. I love driving cars, and in particular, kind of expensive luxury cars. Very few things make me happier than putting the pedal down and exercising the freedom of personal transportation. I chose a horrible hobby. I know the moment I drive off the lot, that car will depreciate and continue to depreciate as I drive it. I'm also fully aware of the continued operating costs that come with car ownership.

The numbers: I've got approximately $60,000 tucked away in the 401k and Roth, which I don't intend to touch until I retire. I've got about $9,000 in cash, and no student loans or debt. I am making $70,000 gross, which after state and federal taxes is much less. Rent is $1750/month. Food averages about $7-$8 for lunch, $12 for dinner. Yes I know I can meal prep to decrease this.

The car: I've got my eyes on a BMW 4 series. New this will run me 46k. Used with some miles and questionable reliability will run me maybe 25k. That's not including insurance, parking, gas, maintenance, etc.

I fully realize I could just buy/lease a reliable entry level Prius or Civic and be on my way for a fraction of the cost. Please tell me how I convince myself I don't need a BMW. Or tell me that this is financially feasible and I'm not shooting myself in the foot making a horrible investment when I'm just starting to get off the ground.",finance
personalfinance,By A House Now or Bet On A Recession?,"28yo single software engineer in the mid-Atlantic region. I'm currently sharing rent in a house with a couple, but I'm getting concerned about a long-term situation.

I'm keeping an eye on the housing market, and around me it's hard to find something that doesn't need serious work (structural problems, mold, archaic plumbing or HVAC systems) for less than ~$350k for a detatched house. I'll admit I'm restricting myself a bit to detatched houses that have garages, because I'm a part-time musician who does pro-audio work as well, so I both need space to make noise without disturbing the neighbors and a way to load equipment into my car without it getting wet.

For my situation,
* No debts (paid off student loans and car earlier this year)
* Maxing out 401(k) and Roth IRA contributions
* Currently have ~7mos cash in emergency fund / high-yield savings for a downpayment, accruing at $500/paycheck (biweekly) / $13k/yr
* Credit score 797 as of today (only drag is average credit card age is &lt;6yrs)
* Extremely stable employment situation - raises and bonuses aren't always guaranteed, but the job itself is very solid (immediate coworkers have been with the company longer than I've been alive)

Given the high credit score and lack of other debts, a 4x-annual-salary mortgage isn't unthinkable, which lands at $385k-ish, which gets past the $350k-barrier. If I don't touch my cash account, that would turn into ~3mos emergency with budget adjustment. So, not counting raises or bonuses (which I'm all putting to cash), I'm basically starting now and looking at the timelines:
* Closing costs $7.6k-$19.5k - 7-18mos savings
* 3.5% FHA is $13.5k - 12mos savings
* 5% is $19.5k - 18mos savings
* 20% is $77k - 71mos savings

As a complicating factor, my current salary is almost exactly the upper limit of some county and state home-purchase-assistance programs that could net me $8-10k for closing/downpayment. Coupled with a very consistent 6.5%/yr growth in home values around here, I'm feeling some pressure to jump into the market. Couple the purchase-assistance with a loan from my 401(k) equal to my annual contributions and I could hit closing+FHA without touching my emergency fund. In theory, my budget structure would allow me to keep maxing my 401(k) for the next year to pay back the loan, though I would have to stop making contributions to cash savings and IRA.

Obviously, I'll personally be in a better financial situation in 3 years (won't need to touch retirement accounts, higher salary to continue IRA contributions, still not at 20% though), but I'm worried about the much-larger-than-inflation-and-raises growth in the local market and the loss of the purchase-assistance opportunities. 

Basically, I'm struggling with economic questions:
* The economy is currently in the second-largest run-up in relevant history (post-1870's) - what's the over-under on a recession in the next three years?
* I know the 2007 crash was a major drag on the housing market, but that was also largely caused by irregularities in the housing market. How have other recessions impacted the housing market?
* The Fed is currently raising interest rates at about 0.25%/quarter. Is that expected to hold? Because 7.5% is much, much worse than 4.5%

I don't want to buy at the top of the market just before a recession (I know people who bought in 2007 and are just now breaking even), but I also don't want to miss out on rates that won't necessarily be coming down again.

TL;DR - I could potentially buy a house this year while preserving an emergency fund by taking a 401(k) loan and purchase assistance; is this a good plan in view of a short-to-medium-term economic forecast?",finance

We have 12K in Manning Napier mutual funds for us and an account started for our child there too with a target fund date around college time. We have 16K in savings/one CD that is about to mature. 

I’m trying to figure out how to do our next steps:

-retirement for me- I thought I could only get a traditional IRA bc I have no income but then it looks like there’s a spousal clause where I could have a Roth or a 401K and I’m just lost. I just need to know what type to go with and then open it. I’ve looked at some recommended lists and was thinking Vanguard target date funds or maybe an index fund and something else in a Schwab account?

-life insurance for me (&amp; disability?)
-Will- finish opening new accounts first?
-additional life insurance for spouse
-kitchen reno- in a 1200sqft condo, not high end stuff
-refinance and retire our home only for the sake of removing my parents who co-signed. (Somewhat last minute. Broker preapproved then went oh shit underwriters reminded me of the 1099 rule... My spouse’s income has always qualified us for the home but when we applied it was 1099 and new so counted as 0 income. He now makes more and W2 so we don’t need parents on loan and title.) But there would be fees and interest rates have gone up so I’m not sure it’s worth it. 

We’re both perfectionists who tend to overthink and not actually DO. We’ve known these things are important for a long time now but are a little overwhelmed with the idea of making the right choices. We were also crazy and moved across the country, bought a house, and had a baby within one month in 2016 so we’re slowly catching up on stuff we would’ve done at the time. Please help!",finance

personalfinance,I need a [somewhat liquid] savings or checking account with better APY and/or bonuses,"I've got some money that I'd like to move away from my local credit union. It's not a bad credit union, but my savings account only carries a 0.25% APY, and I feel as though my money could be earning more. I've looked into several online banks that have a variable APY of around 1.8%, but I've also seen several banks that offer bonuses for meeting certain qualifications, typically minimum balance or deposit requirements.  
  
Some information about what I'm working with: I plan to maintain my checking and savings accounts at my local credit union, just not with as much in there. However, I also recently lost my job. I still have a somewhat steady source of income right now, but need to keep whatever money I move at least slightly liquid in the case that I need it. I'm thinking I'll move about $10,000-12,000 of my savings to another bank with better interest rates/bonuses, but without too many restrictions in the unlikely event that I'll need to withdraw/move/spend all of it for some reason or another. If I hadn't lost my job, I'd probably look into other, possibly higher yield, options, but it is what it is for now.

personalfinance,[International student with SSN] Options for first credit card,"Hi r/personalfinance, long time lurker here.

I'll be moving to the US (California) at the end of the month to start grad school and weighing out my options to get a credit card, mainly to start building credit. Here's my situation:

* I have a SSN from doing an internship in the US a couple of years back, during which I filed taxes.
* I also BofA checking account (I know, I know) with \~$1000 lying around in it, which I'm planning to keep around for now since I currently meet their criteria for no monthly fees. Planning to open a savings account with either Ally, Discover, or my local credit union.
* Even though I am a graduate student, I will **not** be receiving income from the university as I'll be paid under a fellowship from my home country. This income will be wired directly into my US bank account and I will not have to file taxes on it.
* I don't care about interest rates because I plan to pay the bill in full every month, on time, and not carry over any balance. I have responsible spending habits, own a couple of CCs and have a good credit score at home etc. 

Since I don't have a credit score, would my only option be to get a secured card? Or do you think I would have any luck with a student credit card such as the Discover It Student Cash Back? Would BofA consider approving me seeing as I have somewhat of a ""relationship"" with them?

personalfinance,"Would it better to apply for a personal loan or use a credit card to pay for 6,000 orthodontic treatment?","I'm going to get Invisalign. My insurance doesn't cover any Ortho work because I'm over age 20. The whole cost for it would be almost $6000 over a period of  about 10 months The orthodontist wants me to put a down payment of at least 30% intitially(40% and 50% are the other two options) and then make payments each month over the 10 months. Or I can pay everything in full. The monthly payment is determined by the down payment (ranging from 419-299). They also give a 5% discount if paying with cash or check and 3% when paying with debit/credit card.

Here is the thing I would like to put down more than 30 but won't have that money just lying around by the time the appointment comes around next month. So I'm stuck with the other options but not sure which would be better. Here are my finances.

I make about $2800 take home pay a month. About $850 of that is goes to expenses.  I have an outstanding balance of 867 on a credit card of a $8,5000  limit.  Total line of credit is 11,500 across three cards(not looking to get another one). I have no loans and my credit scrore is 810 currently. 
I will also need to plan for a trip back home in the fall(usually a $700-800 venture) and would like to set money aside for an ipad(another few hundered).

The reason why I'm hesitant about using my credit card is because I would like to put  50% down but know I won't able to pay it off in full for a while, thus accumulating interest if I go that route. Plus the discount is lower.

My uncertainty about a personal comes mostly from never having one and not knowing much about it. I know that the interest rates are lower than a credit card(if I'm going to be paying that for a few months, might be better on a loan, right?) and it would be a good way to diversify my line of credit but this is only a 10 month to a year thing. Wouldn't a short term look bad for future approvals?(it doesn't make much sense to take out a 3 year or longer loan for something so short.) Also if I pay it off in like six months would that look bad to lenders due to not keeping it open for a long period of time. Or if I took this one out and needed another loan for a car or something later on, would it look bad to take out more than one type within a three year or five year period? 

Any advice or possible clarifications?",finance
personalfinance,"Need advice: I want to pay off my student loans ASAP, but they comprise nearly all my credit history and I don't want to hurt my score!","Hello, Reddit!

I recently graduated with a BS and am starting my PhD in a couple weeks (yay!). Thankfully, my program is funded so I'll actually be receiving a stipend in lieu of paying tuition or taking on any debt. I run a business, so I have a healthy stream of income with which I've been saving for retirement for the last year. Going forward, I'll be splitting my savings between retirement and a little real estate fund for a down payment in the future.

During my undergrad, I accumulated $25,491.15 in student loan debt, which is spread out across five different accounts ranging in interest from 3.76% to 5.00%. I chipped away at the governmental loans offered to me before they were dispersed, but otherwise did not touch the ones I accepted since only one of them accrued \[a small amount of\] interest during my time in school.

I just got my first credit card a few months ago, and have thus far been responsible with it. My credit score (according to Mint, which checks it every month for me) is hanging out at 762 right now. The one credit card and the loans are the only lines of credit I have, and the only ones I anticipate for at least one more year. I may possibly open up an airline credit card soon, since I fly a ton for work, and I anticipate buying an investment property and getting a mortgage in about a year's time (hence the concern for maintaining a robust credit score).

I would like to knock out some of my loans, as many as possible, really, but am unsure as to the order in which I should do so when thinking about my credit score--  
When I've paid off a loan in full, only then is the account ""closed"", yes? It's not possible to keep it open at $0.00, right?  
Should I knock out the newest ones to help the ""average age of account"" variable?  
Do I kill the bigger ones with higher interest rates?  
Should I simply pay them down rapidly but strategically?  
Will closing them all down and leaving myself with just one credit card account hurt my score?  
Will opening another credit card account mitigate issues stemming from closing my student loan accounts?

As a side note, I do realize investing in my index funds is possibly a better idea than killing all my loans, but I view that as worthwhile due to the peace of mind it would bring and so I have one less avenue to think about when budgeting and paying bills (I'm horribly disorganized and forgetful, so one less thing to remember is huge for me!)

personalfinance,"I financed my car at 4.79% interest with excellent credit, can I get that down?","I financed my car and sort of rushed into it.

Anyway. I've never gotten a loan from a bank or anything like that. Would that be the path for this?

Have 4.79% loan for 24k &gt; Go to bank and try to get a loan for 24k for about 3% interest. Pay off 4.79% finance loan from financing company &gt; continue to pay off lower interest bank loan for 24k around 3%.

financialindependence,32 yo - Buying a house vs tax-advantaged retirement savings,"This question crept more in my mind when I saw a thread in FI about ""Housing Affordability By City"" a few days back and one of the comments mentioned a good FI/RE strategy would be to purchase housing in a city with a housing affordability in the  ""moderate"" range that is also in a steady upward trend.

I turn 32 in 3 months so I am rounding up. Single, no kids, no debt, live in Orlando. 108k annual income, more with overtime. I am currently maxing my 401(k) + 4% match, Roth IRA and putting 15% into a Mega Backdoor Roth. My plan would allow me to hit the total contribution limit of 55k.

* Cash: 111k (Includes emergency fund of 18k and things like saving for when my 2012 Corolla dies)
* Tax-deferred accounts: 78k
* Tax-exempt accounts: 122k

How should I approach this balance? Orlando is of the fastest growing cities in the U.S. Consequently, housing prices are increasing rapidly. In addition, interest rates are also rising. The rise in both housing prices and interest rates is hard to ignore. Consequently, I’m starting to FOMO about buying a house.

personalfinance,Church cleaning pay,"I currently clean a church that is 9600 SQ feet. It has 4  rooms with tiled floors and a large auditorium that seats 200 with a tiled floor. The rest is carpeted. It has 5 bathrooms, 2 of which are larger bathrooms with multiple stalls. I currently make around $600 a month after taxes for cleaning the building once a week. A fair price I believe because the large auditorium floor has to be buffed weekly and the  170+ chairs have to be removed and set back up to do so. In total it takes me around 6 hours to do everything in the building. 

Recently the giving has been way down so the church is re-evaluating the budget. I found out last week they want to cut my pay by nearly 50% to $320 a month, around 80 dollars weekly.

personalfinance,New Car vs Used Car Cost Calculator,"I have created a calculator in Google Sheets that will tell you how much more expensive it is to purchase a new car rather than a used car. The sheet is ""View Only"", but you can make a copy if you are logged into a Google account, or you can download it into an Excel file. Below I will walk you through an example on how to use the calculator.

&amp;nbsp;

[Link to Calculator](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1917uFhnUXSuUanEy_QsrppREbupXVqgWsmSckAiTbaQ/edit?usp=sharing)

&amp;nbsp;

For this example, I will compare buying a new 2018 Honda Civic LX Sedan versus a 2015 Honda Civic LX Sedan.

&amp;nbsp;

**Replacement Age** : I expect to keep either car until it is 8 years old (Keep the new car for 8 years or keep the used car for 5 years). So I input ""8"".

&amp;nbsp;

**Age of Used Vehicle When Bought** : I am looking at a 2015 car (3 years old), so I input ""3"".

&amp;nbsp;

**Residency** : Let's say I live in Massachusetts. I will select ""Massachusetts"" from the drop down list. (Sorry, I only have New England states included. I have to manually research property tax and registration costs for every state).

&amp;nbsp;

**MSRP - New** : The MSRP of a 2018 Honda Civic LX Sedan is $19,740, so I enter ""19740"".

&amp;nbsp;

**MSRP - Used** : The original MSRP of a 2015 Honda Civic LX Sedan is $19,290, so I enter ""19290"".

&amp;nbsp;

**Cost - New** : For this you want to input all one-time costs (Excluding sales tax and registration). Edmunds suggests the 2018 Civic should cost around $18,250, but I will enter ""18,750"" to account for some dealer fees, license fees, etc.

&amp;nbsp;

**Cost - Used** : KBB suggests a 2015 Civic LX Sedan will cost around $12,921, so I input ""12921"".

&amp;nbsp;

**Salvage Value - New** : I expect to keep the car for 8 years. KBB suggests you can get $4,344 for an 8 year old Civic from private sale, so I input ""4344"".

&amp;nbsp;

**Salvage Value - Used** : Since the used car is the same make and model, I expect that I can also get $4,344 for it when it is 8 year old. Thus, I input ""4344"".

&amp;nbsp;

**Down Payment** : Just note that if you want to pay for the car in cash, simply make the down payment the same as the cost.

&amp;nbsp;

Loan interest rate, loan term, fuel economy, miles driven per year, and fuel price are all pretty straight-forward.

&amp;nbsp;

**Insurance** : I got an online quote for an insurance policy on both the new and used car. Note that you will want to input the annual policy premiums.

&amp;nbsp;

**Advanced Maintenance Cost Parameters** : You can play with maintenance costs versus the age of the car. There is a drop-down list that allows you to choose between a fixed method, a linear method, and a hybrid method. The default method is the hybrid method. This means that maintenance costs stay fixed for a few years and then increase every subsequent year. Since this is one of the harder things to model, I gave the user some options in case they think my way of calculating maintenance costs is dumb. Notice the handy graph that shows you how you are calculating maintenance costs.

&amp;nbsp;

**Advanced Insurance Cost Parameters** : Again, it is pretty hard to model insurance costs versus the age of the car, so I have a drop-down menu that allows you to change how the insurance costs change over time. You can adjust a bunch of parameters associated with this. I assume that at some point, you will switch to liability only insurance. Based on some research, it appears that liability-only insurance costs roughly half of the price of a full-coverage policy of the equivalent new car. If you don't like this assumption, you can manually input what you think the liability-only insurance will cost you. Again, there is a handy graph to show you how insurance costs are being calculated.

&amp;nbsp;

With these inputs, I use a least common denominator approach to calculate the average annual cost of ownership of each car. Cells F7 and F8 give the average annual costs associated with the new car and used car respectively. Cell F11 gives the percentage increase in average annual costs associated with buying new.

&amp;nbsp;

In the default Honda Civic example, you will see that the ""Cost of Buying New"" is 4.88%. This means that the 2018 Honda Civic would cost you 4.88% more annually than the 2015 Honda Civic ($4,723 vs. $4,503 in average annual costs respectively).

&amp;nbsp;

-----------------------

&amp;nbsp;

*Note: Registration/property tax costs are estimates. For example, in states like Rhode Island and Connecticut, every city has different mill rates for vehicle property tax. The tax is also based on the book value of the vehicle. So for these two states, I just took the average mill rates for the 10 most populated cities in the respective states. I also assumed a constant depreciation of just under 17% per year for tax purposes. A state like Maine was much simpler, because the mill rate is the same everywhere in the state. In Maine, the mill rate goes down based on the age of the car and you just need to know the MSRP of the car.

&amp;nbsp;

In New Hampshire, the registration renewal fees are tiered based on the weight of the car. I just used the renewal cost for the lowest weight class (Most sedans fall into this). Every state has their own way of getting their money. This made it time consuming to figure out for every state, so I stopped when I finished the New England states. I think my sales tax, property tax, and registration fees for these states are correct/good estimates, but I easily could have made mistakes.",finance

Total loan amt: $27.5k

Interest rate: 8%

First payment due: 3/1/2019 - but I'd like to start paying asap

Monthly pay: \~$5k after 401k, taxes, insurance

Annual income/location: $110k in Seattle

Rent: $1,600

Debt: None

Credit score: \~750

Other: 1-2x a year I can afford to do a large one-time payment of $2,000+

Still overwhelmed by all these numbers because I've lived my whole life with avg of &lt;$500 in my checkings account and my family has always lived by cash, paycheck to paycheck with neither outstanding debt nor savings. All advice is hugely appreciated.",finance

I called Questrade, and they confirmed that this means that I will be paid interest. But, the guy I was talking to didn't seem to know what exactly he was talking about, and at times gave conflicting info.

My question to more experienced traders, in your experience do you usually get paid interest to short index? (I'm doing this on a leveraged platform- about 4-5% leverage, which gives me about 20x leverage).",finance

personalfinance,"My girlfriend is joining the Air Force, where does that leave me?","So here's the thing:

My girlfriend's mom has convinced her that joining the Air Force is the best option for her considering she doesn't really have a direction in life (no complaint). We both work in a restaurant: She's a waitress and I'm a cook. She brings home, roughly, $1,600 a month. Sometimes more, sometimes less. I make $17 with the option for overtime if I want with a minimum of 40 hours a week ($496 a week, and roughly $2k a month).

She is really considering joining the Air Force for the pay and benefits. I have no issue with it other than that leaves me paying for our living expenses. She said she'd help pay with the money she'd make and thought that buying a house would be a good option. I, however, I don't think buying a house right now is a good option. I think that would put us more in, excuse my french, deep shit. I currently have a car payment of $310 a month, $11kish that i still owe with a 11% interest rate.

Our current living situation is that we live in an apartment for $710 a month. I also have recently been looking into going to college for Accounting (I haven't gone to college for the fact that I don't really believe going into debt for education is worth it. I don't want to go into debt for something that I wouldn't like. I've always wanted to run my own business and believe Accounting is the best route for my career.)

I would be going to college while she is stationed else where. I'm not quite sure what my options are or which direction I should take. I know I want to better my career from a BBQ cook to something more. My only debt(s) is my car which I have about 2 years left to pay it off.

It might help to mention I only have $2k saved (It's in the process of being built up right now) and no emergency fund. What are my options and what would you do if you were in my position? Thank you in advance to anyone/everyone who answers and helps me out! :)",finance

Is there any chance I could convince them to raise my limit to 5k so I could transfer the entire balance to the new card? 

The way I see it, I have always paid ~$200 per month on time (which is above the minimum payment for both). It makes no difference to me if I pay it between two banks or one bank, but it would be nice for me to pay a lower interest rate. For them, if they upped my limit, then they could charge me interest on 5k instead of 2k. 

It seems like a win-win to me, but would the bank go for it?

personalfinance,A little bit confused about FAFSA Verification,"Hi all, I'm a third year in college and I've been selected for FAFSA verification this year and I've never done it before. Of the four forms to complete and/or submit to the college, (Parent Institutional Verification Form, Student Federal Tax Return Transcript, Student Institutional Verification Form, Parent Federal Tax Return Transcript) I'm pretty confused on what to do for the Student Federal Tax Return Transcript of 2016.

I'm positive I did not file for any taxes in 2016 and that I was filed as a dependent under my father. Therefore 1, 3 and 4 were generally easy to fill out and submit. But I'm unsure of how I can get any sort of Student Federal Tax Return Transcript from the IRS, 

I've tried the website many times over the past few days and have not been able to create an account (with accurate information) to view my transcript, or order a transcript by mail. Even calling in I have been unable to receive a transcript, all attempts end in some form of failure. 

Finally, I submitted a form to receive a Letter of Non-Filing to the IRS a few days ago that will be sent to my college. Will this be sufficient to clear FAFSA verification? Or should I continue trying the IRS services and seeing if I can somehow get a tax return transcript.",finance

business,How To Save Money in Tough Economic Times,"The Consumer Federation of America recommends saving money by avoiding impulse buys; limiting unnecessary conveniences, such as entertainment memberships; and researching lower rates on essential purchases, including auto insurance, prescriptions, utilities and phone services. Tracking monthly spending habits helps consumers develop a cost-saving budget and identify repetitive purchases that quickly drain bank accounts. 

Establish a personal grace period to evaluate questionable purchases, and avoid relying on credit or overdraft protection, the CFA states. Waiting gives consumers time to think over the financial consequences of a purchase and consider redirecting those funds to bills or savings accounts. If credit or debit is the only option, pay off as much of the balance as possible to prevent interest charges and late fees.

Ask about discounts and reduced rates for must-have services, and consider downgrading to the basics Thoroughly compare the out-of-pocket costs and premiums for auto, home and health insurance, and request an energy audit to lower utility bills.

 The CFA suggests making small adjustments, such as switching to generic prescription drugs and lowering cell phone data plans, to save hundreds of dollars over the course of a year.

Make a list of rarely used subscriptions and costly indulgences, and look for opportunities to scale down, the CFA states. Instead overspending on magazine subscriptions, concerts, sporting events or movies, take advantage of free or inexpensive local entertainment and libraries. Substitute homemade foods for expensive lunches and coffee, and bring a shopping list to stay focused at the grocery store.",finance

financialindependence,Celebrating the small steps.,"My wife and I are celebrating our 9 months into our FIRE journey. It has been an incredible journey so far. Reading up on all the FiRE blogs, learning about tax savings, and interest rates, it seems like we were different people nine months ago. We are taking the time to celebrate today not because we hit a net worth mile stone but because we have hit our “recovery” goal.

When we started, we owed money on 3 credit cards, 2 vehicles, taxes, creditors, medical bills, mortgage, and home repair vendors. We had no budget, no plan, and very little retirement savings. As of today, we only owe money on two things, our mortgage and one vehicle with 1% interest.  We are on pace to max out one of our 401ks this year, both ROTHs, and our HSA. 

I know there are not a lot of financial details and honestly, it only took us 9 months, I’m sure others had a harder and longer road to recovery, but it feels really good right now to have just completed this part of our plan. We are now ready to save for our future purchases instead of borrowing. 

I want to thank this sub for all the advice received, MMM, and my friend that showed me this different path.",finance
personalfinance,Should I consolidate my student loans?,"I have about 15 different loans through the feds which equal up to about 95k, interest included. They are all managed by Great Lakes.

The remaining 9 loans are evenly split between 45k at 5.3% and 19k at 6.8%. These are all unsubsidized. The other account has one loan for 2k which is subsidized at 5.6%. So far I have been on an income based payment with $0 payments. I just landed my first job after grad school and will need to set something else up and start paying soon. I work in state gov and hope to receive loan forgiveness one day, but as of right now I don't know my best approach. My big issue is that I just found out I had one private loan from undergrad that is 2k that has fallen behind because it has not been included with my other loans and I apparently haven't had anything set up for it. It has been sent to a debt collector and they said I can consolidate it with my other loans at great lakes. Should I do this? Im affraid to consolidate everything because I hate to lose the 3% interest I have on a good part of my loans.",finance

personalfinance,"Refinanced my students loans, bought a car that isn't 15 years old pushing 200k miles, built a savings account emergency fund, now what...","So in general, I have student loans as high as 5.75% (even after refinancing :P). A car loan that's interest rate is far below any of my student loan interest rates (so basically just making the payments as needed and ignoring it). Soon I'll have enough in my savings account that I will feel comfortable sitting on that in case of emergencies. However, once I hit that number, I'll want to stick some money in something other than a savings account that yields next to nothing. So I guess I'm just wondering, should I just increase the contribution to my 401k (my employer gives 3% regardless or matching or not), start a Vanguard account and start investing in Index Funds or whatnot, or just continue to throw extra money at student loans that have somewhat high interest rates (i.e., 5.75%)?

personalfinance,We've decided to co-sign my brother-in-law's refinance. What happens now?,"Tl;dr My BIL has to refinance his house to to keep it because divorce. My wife and I have decided to co-sign. What happens now?
 
Background: My BIL and his wife are getting a divorce. They have two young daughters, a house, and about $30,000 in credit card debt they racked up during a period of 1-2 years where they were both on disability due to workplace injuries. (I say it was during that period, but I don't actually know if any of it existed prior.) His wife has since returned to work, and his workers' comp case is getting resolved, but he still has lingering issues that make working difficult.


During a recent argument, she threatened to make him sell the house so she could have her half of it. Long before they decided to split up, the agreement was that if they ever did separate, he would get to keep the house. This is much more important because since he can't work full time he's keeping the girls, and he wants to provide stability for him any way he can. She relented, and they decided he could keep the house if he took care of the CC debt, the extent of which we don't really know.


Fortunately, they live in a low COL area, and they were able to get the mortgage about halfway paid off (there's about $150,000 left, I'm told) while they were both working. So the payment isn't high compared to what I'm familiar with living in the San Jose area, but he's going to have to refinance in order to be secure in making the payments.


He'll need a co-signer, and we're the only ones in the family that can do it. There aren't really any other options that involve the girls keeping their home.


His plan is to get his ex's name off the title and mortgage ASAP and start working as much as he can to cover the cheaper house payments. He and the girls are going to move in with his mom for about a year and rent out the house, putting the rent toward the mortgage. The girls are at his mom's pretty frequently, and she lives nearby, so living there won't be as jarring for them as selling the house would be. He's committed to working and making the house payments for their sake and also to not screw us over.


We've basically decided that we're going to co-sign. What are we in for, though? We're mid-20's and don't have a mortgage, but we both work and aren't planning on having kids any time soon, if at all, so we're not hurting for money. I trust him to do his part, but I recognize that from a mental standpoint, it's probably best we just view it as buying the house.


Some specific questions:
1. What can we do to help my BIL plan for this?
2. How can we plan for this so it doesn't bite us in the butt if it goes south?
3. What effect does this have on our eligibility to buy a house of our own?
 
Any help would be appreciated. Thanks!

I am trying to complete the NJW4 form for NJ as I will be moving to the state but working out of my home office (company is based out of PA but since I am working out of home office, I will be only withheld and charged for taxes in my home state).

personalfinance,Should I be paying extra on my private loan or on my student loans on IBR?,"I have a private student loan with a balance of $22,130. It has a 6.55% interest rate and a minimum payment of 279.47/month.

We applied for assistance through the hospital, were denied and tried to appeal it- all within the letters we received. In the mean time, it went to collections. Still young, still dumb I tried to do a payment plan, paid $100 here, $50 there. It went to a second collections agency. These people, are bullies. Every time they call, threaten me, are rude, etc etc. I offered the 20%, as suggested here and other sites to begin negotiation. The collection agent was nasty about it, called me unreasonable. The one time I talked to someone seeming they had the power to do something, we were disconnected and I didn’t get a call back. I can afford to pay it, but the more they call- the less I want to. It was just reported to Transunion. My score went from 803-758 (Still in the excellent range). The current cost is $3,300. What should I do next? I’m fed up with it- the whole thing.

personalfinance,"$15K CC debt, running about $300 in the red every month.... I need help. Thanks!","Hi everyone. I am in a crippling situation running just about $300 in the red every month and it has added up over the last 3 years on my credit cards along with having gone on 3 amazing vacations in that time frame. I am currently making only $50K a year (salary) and have accumulated almost $16K in credit card debt all about 23% annual interest rate (terrible). I have 4 cards. One has $9K on it, another $3.5K, another with $2.5K, the last with $350 on it and 2 loans ($850 left on those total) from Affirm for some musical equipment I financed for a side hustle to bring some more money in. The interest rate on these cards and those loans are making it near impossible for me to survive and make a dent on the CC principle… I am basically only paying interest every month
    
My credit score is only 647. I have been working hard at trying to get this higher over the last 5 years, but since my credit card debt is 92% of my total credit limit, it is killing my score. Also I just paid off my auto loan early last month, which dropped my credit score 8 points as it closed an existing line of credit I had (negative impacting). I only had 1 inquiry into my credit over the last 2 years until today for that loan and am on time with my bills.
    
I have contacted my credit union and I only qualify for a $7k consolidation loan for this due to my score. I could potentially get an additional loan against my vehicle, but probably not for much since it is an ’04 RAM 1500, only worth about $3.5K, or get a co-signer on my consolidation loan (I DO NOT WANT TO DO THIS and I don’t really have anyone who could help here).
    
I took out $5k on my 403b last year and invested this into crypto currency, which was a great idea at the time and should have sold at all time high in January. Hindsight is 20/20 since I would not be in this situation currently had I done so. I am still up on that investment, slightly, and do believe it will go very high again in the next 1-5 years, along with extremely high in the next 10 years. I just need to tread these waters in the meantime. If it sky rockets again I do plan on selling off up to 25% of my holdings to wipe out all of my debt, until then I will hold, this is part of my retirement portfolio now, which I manage myself.
    
Would it be a good idea to take out that bank loan, pay off the 403b loan, (which has a really low interest rate 3% or something like that), in order to borrow against my 403b loan again as soon as I can afterwards, max out my full amount that I can borrow there to then pay off as much of my toxic credit card debt as possible? I can probably borrow up to about $15K from that fund against my vested amount…. I know it’s not the best to borrow against my future, but I am sort of at a loss for options right now.
     
Currently I contribute 5% of my salary to my 403b, my employer matches up to 6% with an additional 3% on top whether I contribute or not. I don’t want to lower this because it is basically doubling that allocated amount of money instantly when I contribute. But I would consider dropping this if it makes sense in order to pay down my principle faster.
    
I have gone through my expenses and have slashed everything I can that is extra, from lowering my auto insurance from $120 a month to $85, cancelling HULU $13 a month and cancelling one of my gym memberships that I wasn’t using $10.  Here is my current monthly budget and my monthly take home as of now:
    
    * $1200 bi-weekly (roughly $2400 a month)
    
    * (1000)	Rent   (I live outside of Boston, COL is extremely high here and way worse in the city. This is considered extremely cheap housing)
    * (85)		Auto Insurance
    * (240)	Fuel
    * (300)	Food &amp; necessities
    * (85)		Student Loans
    * (146)	Affirm loan
    * (90)		403b loan
    * (250)	Amex
    * (300)	Master Card
    * (75) 		Chase 1
    * (50)		Chase 2
    * (65)		Gym (2 memberships, one near my place of employment $30, one near home $35. I value this investment into my health as it allows me to be healthy, have a strong immunity and be able to continue to work. I don’t want to cut this expense)
    
    This brings my monthly expenses to roughly:
    
    * $2686 total
    
This leaves me with $0 in savings and no money to go do anything fun either. I am open to all suggestions and getting a second job will be a hard one to juggle since I am a Jr. Systems Administrator and my job requires me to be on call 24/7 with no rotation from first tier. I am taking classes and working on getting certificates in order to get a promotion with a substantial salary increase, but this is going to take about another year to do so. My plan is to make extra money DJ’ing on the weekends, hopefully 2-4 times a month, but am currently growing a name for myself and getting myself out there (time investment, networking phase).

personalfinance,Shallow Credit Home Buyer,"I am a male in my early 20's and have been very fortunate to have had parents who have put me into a good situation.  They paid for my college education so I have never had student loans.  They bought me a car so I have never had an auto loan.  My entire credit history is just two credit cards.  I am very lucky to have had parents who worked hard and lived within their means so that they could retire early and provide me with a jump start.  I hope to provide the same benefits to my children if/when I have them someday.

Now comes the finance/trade-off question.  I want to buy a house within the next 1-3 years (I'm not in a rush, when the right one comes I'll pull the trigger).  Because I have had these things provided for me my credit is rather ""shallow.""  My score is pretty good but it could go higher.  I had heard some people say that banks will not care/take into consideration giving you a better interest rate if your credit is 760 or above.  However I recently spoke with a financial adviser and they suggested that this was not the case.  They said I could likely get a 0.25%-0.50% lower interest rate on a mortgage by increasing my score into the upper echelons.  They even suggested buying a car to get the loan on my credit and boost my score.  This sounded pretty outlandish to me (because I already have a car that work fine and only has \~60K miles on it) but when I think about 0.50% on a $500K-$600K mortgage it might make sense?  So here are the main issues/questions:

1) Will a credit score of greater than 760 actually improve a mortgage interest rate by 0.25%-0.50%?

2) If so, will buying a car and taking out a reasonable loan (1%-2%) increase my credit score into the upper echelons (I'm pretty religious about paying my credit cards off every month so I'm willing to bet I'll never miss a payment)?

3) What kind of car do I get?  The car I have now is pretty good so what do I get?  A Get Around investment (this is a rental car app where car owners can rent their cars out for a couple days at a time)?

4) Is this a crazy idea?  It's against my intuition as spending money on a car I don't need is strange, however I currently have the means to do so if this will  be a net benefit considering an improved mortgage rate.

CryptoCurrency,My Perspective and Response to the NY Times Article about Investor Loss,"Hello and to whom it may concern (presumably co-believers in the future of blockchain and cryptocurrency),

Today I read a sensationalizing sob-piece from the NY Times that, to the say the least, was irritating on account of an abysmal lack of context. Essentially, the article presumed that there is some sort of crypto-unique hard-lesson to be learned from the recent bursting of the crypto-bubble. I, for one, very much think the blockchain and cryptocurrency story is still unraveling and has a long way to go before we draw any such lessons on account of the detailing of the worst investment timings from the pocket of November 2017 through January.

To counteract any such collective ""crypto-investor"" wisdom that the NY Times is purporting, I'd like to share a bit about my personal experience and detail my takeaways. Furthermore, I'd like to detail how bubble-bursting isn't at all unique to cryptocurrency and blockchain.

Back in Fall of 2016 I was very interested in the emergence of blockchain and cryptocurrency. I was scared to just jump-in and convert my fiat to cryptocurrency and decided instead to keep an eye on the market and litmus test a few of my ideas. My first prediction was that BTC would rise substantially following the US presidential election. During this time I educated myself a little more and saw my prediction unfold. Instead of diving in head first, I cost-averaged my buys over the coming months and also bought into a very select few altcoin projects that intrigued me. Long story short, although I have definitely absorbed some ""on paper"" losses recently, I'm substantially above my initial investment. So what lesson have I learned? I didn't learn much to be honest, I just reinforced my philosophy that investors should take their time and average their buys while knowing that it is always risky to delve into an investment when it is ""mid-flight"" (i.e. in the middle of a parabolic upswing).

While blockchain investment seems to be going great the same cannot be said of my decisions in the housing market. Back in 2013 I bought my first home in accordance with my life plans. I knew that buying a home was a pretty shit investment on paper when I did the math in an excel sheet and discovered that as a renter paying $800/mo I could easily outpace with my 5 year, ""home-owner self"" if I managed to save 25% of every pay check and use those savings for annual 2% return. What I discovered on the home owner side was that my home needed to make pretty significant gains in equity and be partially rented out to keep pace with my renter opportunity cost over 5 years -- and this was all ""on paper"" realizing I couldn't even use the equity in my home unless I sold my home; furthermore in this scenario I hadn't even deducted the cost of using a realtor making outpacing my liquid, renter opportunity cost highly unlikely over 5 years. It wasn't until beyond my 10 year projection that it finally started to look like an arguably prudent decision to own a home -- but even this conclusion is highly speculative and based on historically low interest rates. Of course, this could all someday be dismantled by a sudden surge in the housing market and an appreciable gain in equity but at this point, looking at a 15% loss on my home after deducting for settlement -- reaping this reward will likely be a 20 year game! The worst part? My home made me house-broke for years and I couldn't really afford to invest in anything else; had I not owned a home it would've been very likely for me to have invested in the crypto-sphere much sooner.

That said I now finally have a somewhat manageable strategy with my home that allows me to invest and use my money elsewhere -- I moved out of the f\*cking thing and rent it out while living in countries that are appreciably cheaper. To make this manageable I had to re-amortize to 20 years of monthly payments after 5 years of double-up payments to stay cash-flow neutral -- how ridiculous. So to date my only real regret is this -- I didn't have any money to put into crypto when I first felt compelled to put some in.

All of that being said, I want to quickly detail some of the crashes we've seen in other markets and stocks and really hammer home the point that crypto is not at all unique in this regard. Not only that, but crypto has some distinct advantages over some of these other investment classes that have seen bubble-bursts. Let's take a very quick look:

San Fransisco Housing Market:

Peak average price in 2005: $856,300

Low since peak: $507,900 (40% loss not accounting for settlement fees).

Year of Price Recovery: 2017 (12 years later, not adjusted for inflation)

Worst part takeaway: 0 liquidity, housing market collapse coupled with economic recession forced a lot of homeowners into defaulting. Many people's lives have been a story of, to this day, trying to recover from this catastrophic crash.

Amazon Stock:

Peaking Price in 1999: $85

Low since peak: $5.97 (93% loss !)

Year of Price Recovery: 2007 (8 years later)

Best part takeaway: Patient investors from 1999 are now looking at a price of $1900 (2200% gain). Brave investors from the low are looking at a 317,000% percent gain (wow).

Microsoft Stock:

Peak price in 1999: $38

Low since peak: $12

Year of Price Recovery: 2014 (15 years later)

Takeaway: It can suck when a bubble doesn't burst quickly but rather dwindles for years -- it makes the road to recovery long.

Noteworthy: the only thing that had actual utility out of these three investment examples was the house. That said, realizing that utility during the recession would've been immensely difficult. Conversely, the Microsoft and Amazon stocks at least had liquidity should it have been absolutely necessary to convert to fiat.

So what is the differentiation for something like BTC here? To start, you will not have to sell your BTC to be able to use it. There are already vendors accepting BTC and with initiatives like Bakkt getting launched ubiquitous vendor acceptance will be right around the corner. If you absolutely are feeling the pressure to sell because you over-leveraged yourself, at least you will be able to utilize your BTC in a piece-wise fashion at points of purchase in the very near future.

If you put all your funds into a top-tier shitcoin there won't be solace for you I'm afraid -- but don't be turned off of crypto on account of this. It is also true in stocks that when you invest in shit companies you lose money. I'm afraid there is no safe haven for this. Furthermore, anything can be turned to shit if enough panicky people decide something ought to be sold; such is the inescapable rule of economics.

So speaking for myself, I'm really elated at the pace of this bubble-burst. We are back down to pre-ridiculous-parabolic-upswing levels and from here we can start to build. Not only that, a lot of the capital raised for the good projects from the past year will be put to good use and we can all happily observe these developments as we progress toward mass adoption -- which is inevitable.

I don't know about everyone else here but I know what I'm in it for. I'm waiting to be able to spend my crypto like I would've my fiat. In the meantime my life remains largely unchanged -- I'm still working here and there to get by. This was my exact position before I got into crypto, this was my same position during the bubble, but that said I'm a lot closer to some meaningful liberty than I was before investing.

I don't give investment advice but if your life has remain unchanged on account of this bubble burst, I really don't see the point in salvaging a 90% loss unless you truly have some divine insight to think this whole thing is burning to the ground (not how I would wager). Just keep doing what you were already doing, and as long as your lifestyle is enriching then really all of this money-stuff is just a bonus :).

I'll leave it at that. Happy Monday Everyone.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Credit Card APR,"Sorry if this isn't the right place. Also sorry if this is a stupid question. 

I've had the Chase Sapphire Preferred CC for a few years now, I use it for literally everything but I pay it off right away. There are some months here and there where I will carry a balance, sometimes for a small amount sometimes for like 5K. I've never missed a payment. I know that my CC history is kind of young, my oldest credit card I opened when I was 18 is 9 years old. I have a student loan, a car loan a two other credit cards. According to mint and credit karma my credit score is around 750-760 (I honestly don't know how accurate those sites are?)

So I know that my CC has always had kind of a high APR, at 24.74%. I didn't really question it, but one day I was talking to my cousin who has the same card, and he mentioned his is only 17%. ThenIi went around and asked like 6 different people and they all have it around 17%. Even my dad is at 16.99% and I know he has not that great credit (low to mid 600s). So my cousin used to work at a bank and told me to call and negotiate my APR and they should be able to reevaluate my account. 

I called Chase and they basically told me there is no one to negotiate my APR with, that they do not do that at Chase. He also told me that they internally evaluate all their accounts twice a year and if there is lower rate available they offer it by sending a letter through the mail. 

I must reiterate, I love using my cc because of the travel point benefits. I've taken a lot of trips using the points and I also have the Amazon Prime card so I like that it is all one online account. I want to keep using it but I mean I don't like the interest rate and I also don't like how the guy shrugged me off like I was an idiot for asking for a lower APR. Is there anything I can do? Should I start looking into other credit cards?

personalfinance,Medical School Loan Repayment Questions,"Hi all-

I’m two months into residency and am trying to get my financial house in order. I have a few questions about student loan repayment that extensive Googling hasn’t helped with to date. 

**I. The Basics**

\-Income: $63,000 a year, translates to \~$3372/month after taxes, albeit in a very HCOL area.

\-Spousal income: \~$40,000 a year (we filed separately)

\-Residency is four years in length, going into a well-compensated specialty. Am +/- on fellowship, which is typically 1-2 years in duration. 

**II. Student Loans**

\---Federal Loans (Grace period ends 12/2018)---

Unsubsidized Stafford: $52,751 at 5.97%

\---Institutional Loans (Grace period ends 6/2019)---

(Ann) Perkins: $32,000 at 5%

Institutional 1: $7,500 at 6%

Institutional 2: $22,500 at 6%

Institutional 3: $3750 at 6%

My plan is to consolidate the Stafford and Perkins loans and start making payments under PAYE vs. REPAYE vs. IBR as well as refinance the institutional loans just before or after the expiration of their grace period in June.  Following residency, am planning to either make minimum payments through PSLF if I work at a qualifying institution or pay down aggressively if I don’t. 

**III. The Questions**

1. **Timing of Consolidation:** Is there any benefit to waiting until the expiration of the Perkins’ grace period to consolidate the Perkins and Stafford? Which is to say, do I get more out of 9 months of the interest subsidy of an income driven repayment plan or the lack of interest accrual on the Perkins over that same interval? (I am too stupid to do this math.)

2. **IBR or PAYE?** These have the two lowest payments of the income-driven plans, but (as above), the niceties of the interest subsidies elude me. Per the calculator I pay less under PAYE than IBR. 

3. **PSLF** If I’m going to be entering an income-driven plan regardless, is there any reason not to do PSLF other than the payment submission and record-keeping inconveniences? My reservation is that the studentloans.gov calculator assumes a steady rate of pay increase when I’ll instead see a large jump after 4-5 years of training, so not sure whether its estimate of the amount saved is accurate. Uncertain whether I’ll wind up at a nonprofit place of employment after residency, but if I have a better opportunity elsewhere then in terms of payment amounts nothing materially changes, right?

Thanks for any guidance!",finance
personalfinance,"Want to pay off my student loans in 4 years, looking for feedback on my plan","Hey there /r/personalfinance. Long time lurker, first time poster.

This community has helped me so much the past few years to get on top of my finances. The best thing it helped me with was just sitting down and looking at everything. So, thank you, from the bottom of my heart. You've changed my life.

As a next step in my process of being open and honest with my finances, I wanted to publish my stats and get some advice from the community.

In the last 2 years, I’ve gotten back on top of my student loans, paid off all my credit card debt, went from $0 to $26,000 in my 401k, and increased by credit score from 508 to 622 (so far - unfortunately I have some defaults and late payments that won’t come off my report for another 3 years).


**Basic stats:**

- 36/single

- HCOL area (NYC)

- $130K pre-tax salary 

- $5000/month take-home after taxes, healthcare, retirement

- Rent, utilities, internet: $2000/month

- Food/clothing/transportation/etc: $600/month

- Student loan payments (currently): $740/month

- Credit card payments - was ~1600/month (this is now freed up)


Now that my credit card debt is cleared, I’m wondering how best to tackle my student loans. Especially if I want to continue getting my credit score up.


I have 2 Stafford loans (these are way more than I borrowed due to forbearances, late payments, basically spending the entirety of my 20s avoiding them - but are in good standing as of the last few years)

- $27,848.21 @ 4.875%, pay $170.39/month

- $33,655.95 @ 4.875%, pay $214.50/month


And one private loan (defaulted in 2013, been paying $354.90/month since then for “rehabilitation""):

- $49,759.85 @ ~0% interest (it’s $1.16/month interest) 


I’ve left all the loans at minimum payments while I’ve gotten everything else back on track.

I was successful with the snowball repayment structure for my credit cards, so I am planning on doing that again.


**My plan:**


1. Up $27K loan payment to $1200/month - that would mean I would pay that off in 2 years (I'm not adding this to my debt snowball for the credit card payments, cause I would like a little more breathing room) 

2. Once that’s paid off, calculate whatever it would then take to pay the $33K loan off in 2 years (or less)

3. That means both those loans would be paid off in 4 years, which I feel is a feasible timeline

4. For the private loan, they’ve given me settlement offers a few times for around the ~25K mark, but I didn’t have the money and couldn’t afford the extra taxes on that income, so I feel I’ll just leave that as-is, and then handle it down the road and try to get them to come down even more if I can


**Other details:**


- My return rate on my 401k seems to average between 4.5% and 6%

- I can’t leave NYC at the moment, but I’m exploring other job opportunities in LCOL areas, as well as remote positions - this would be something I could do in 2 years or so

- I've tried re-financing with Sofi/Prosper/etc but my low credit score prevents me from any of those services at the moment

I’d love to hear feedback on this plan. Even though it’s a low interest rate, I feel like the psychological boost of being done with these loans would outweigh keeping them longer and say, putting more money into my 401k, which I realize I’m way behind on. But I’m open to suggestions!

Also, high five to anyone here who has spent the last few years turning their financial life around!!",finance
personalfinance,Refinancing a Personal Loan -- Bad News Bears?,"Hey all,

I've had a personal loan through Best Egg for about a year now. I took it out to pay off some lingering cc debt I couldn't shake, to the tune of about $16k. I've been paying the loan off every month as scheduled and am now just under $14k.

I am also a pretty prolific Amex customer and received an ad about an Amex personal loan, saying I'm pre-approved for up to $15k at about half the interest rate with what i'm paying Best Egg. This makes sense, because i've gotten a pretty hefty raise in the last year and, because I'm not carrying any credit card balances anymore, my credit has improved by about 50 points.

QUESTION: Is there any common sense reason I \*shouldn't\* refinance with Amex and use it to pay off the Best Egg loan?

personalfinance,My credit card guide for college students.,"Hi personalfinance,

I'm a sophomore in college and I really enjoy optimizing credit cards for max cashback/utility (and also building a great credit score along the way). I see a lot of posts asking about getting started with credit cards, and I just wanted to share what I know. I'm a bit obsessive with my finances, and have applied that obsession to cards as well.

## What are credit cards good for?
Two things:  

- Getting cash back or other rewards for your regular purchases.  
- Building a credit history.

Credit cards are NOT a good way to spread a large purchase out due to the insane interest rates they carry. If you pay interest on your credit card you're likely to cancel out any benefit you get from their rewards programs. Treat your credit card like it's a debit card and pay your balance in full every month! This can be easily automated with nearly every card provider.

## What card should I get first?

If you're a college student with no credit history, there is no better starter card than the Discover it Student. I recommend the standard Discover it Student Cash Back, but if you use a lot of gas or eat out a lot, the Discover it Chrome could make sense for you.

Pros of Discover it Student:

- Great cashback. 1% on everything and 5% on rotating categories. These vary from Amazon.com to restaurants to gas to groceries. Also, for the first year, all cashback is doubled, which means 2% cashback on everything, and a whopping 10% back on the 5% categories. This year I really enjoyed getting 10% back on restaurants.
- Likely to get approved with no credit history (I was).
- $20 statement credit for good grades (3.0 GPA and up).
- Good customer support, free FICO score.

Cons of Discover it Student:

- You'll probably get a pretty low credit limit.
- Discover recently removed purchase protection and a few other perks from their cards.

## What should my second card be?

After you hold on to your Discover it (and pay it in full every month) for about 10-12 months, you'll be ready to get your next card. If you paid your card in full every month, you'll hopefully have a great credit score at this point.

For your second card I strongly recommend the American Express Blue Cash Everyday. This card is absurdly good for a no-fee card and has the following pros:

- Easy approval, high credit limit.
- $150 signup bonus after spending $1000 in the first 3 months.
- 3% back on groceries, 2% back on gas, 1% back on everything else. 

However, the Blue Cash Everyday, like every credit card, also has cons:

- Less widely accepted than MasterCard, Visa, or even Discover.
- Minimum $25 redemption of cash back.


Overall, the Blue Cash Everyday is the best no-fee grocery/gas card on the market in my opinion, and is a great card to have.

## What next?

Keep paying all your cards in full every month and spending responsibly and you'll enjoy great cashback and a great credit score! After the Discover it Student and AmEx Blue Cash Everyday, there are a lot of cards you can go for next, including:

- Uber Visa (4% on dining, 2% back on Uber AND Lyft, $100 sign-up bonus)
- Citi Double Cash (2% back on everything, a simple no-frills card).
- Chase Freedom (almost a carbon copy of Discover it, but with different 5% categories so its good to maximize cashback)


The world is your oyster. Hope this helped! If you have any questions or comments feel free!",finance
personalfinance,Refinance auto loan not sure who to apply to,"My credit score is 795-805 depending on which agency you check.

I have an auto loan of 17.25k with an interest rate of 5.54% this is ridiculous for my credit score so I am looking to refinance.

- Rategenius for a 60 month loan at 3.74%
- AUTOPAY Auto Refinance - 60 month at 3.74% ($475 in fees so this one is out of the question.)

CryptoCurrency,How to buy bitcoin the easy way,"Being vast and all caught up in the whole Bitcoin together with other alt coins within the crypto currency platform, I can honestly say ""How to buy Bitcoin"" is one history's frequently asked question since the inception of the block chain technology.

Nobody really has a definite answer about the origin of Bitcoin but according to most famous business blogs, Bitcoin was believed to have been created in 2009 by an anonymous computer hacker who used the the screen name ""Satoshi Nakamoto"" with a few links to the Russian federation.

Initially, Bitcoin became famous within the darknet, making it untraceable and a much preferred means of exchange among black hat internet users. This made Bitcoin an almost impossible asset to acquire by conventionary methods via credit/debit cards.

To make matters much easier, Companies like Coinbase, coinmama, CEX, Bitpanda, and even selected public ATM came into existence and simplified the rigorous process of buying bitcoin.

The most preferred method of buying Bitcoin of the aforementioned methods remains using coinbase which prides itself as the most trusted digital currency platform with additional unparalled trading bonuses including secure storage, insurance protection and having built an undisputable reputation.

personalfinance,Advantages and disadvantages of going the “consumer proposal” route.,"Tl:dr: Looking into a consumer proposal and would like some advice as to whether that’s my best route. 

I am a 32 year-old full time teacher in Canada. I make 75k a year. I take home roughly 1700$ bi-weekly. I recently did a calculation of all my unsecured debt today (credit cards, line of credit, student loan, furniture store loan, overdue property tax) and it comes up to about 35k. I spend around 900$ a month on just debt repayment and I feel like it’s going absolutely nowhere. The interest rates for all the debt range from 5-46% APR. I feel like I am making really good money for someone my age and I don’t have any savings or investments because I’m too busy paying off my debt. I think it’s also important to add that I have a house with a mortgage and a car that I am currently financing. 

I did a bit of research today on consumer proposals. I made an appointment for a consultation that is taking place next week. Based on what I’ve read about them, here is what I understand:
-They can reduce the amount of debt you have to pay back
-One lump sum of money per month to pay back the remaining debt
-Doesn’t include home mortgages or auto loans
-Negatively affects your credit score and will do so for 3 years after the total is repaid

I really think this is my best route. I know my credit score will be negatively affected, but I already have a mortgage and a car loan and can’t really foresee any need for “good credit” in the near future. I feel like this will be the best way for me to create some savings and it will force me to be better with my money as I won’t be able to get a credit card or line of credit for a long time. 

Not looking for advice on spending and budgeting. It is something I work on every day. I guess what I’m really looking for is experience with consumer proposals and whether or not it really is the best option for me. 
Thanks.",finance
personalfinance,Need help with forming my plan to get out of debt,"My wife and I got married three months ago, and we each have debt that we have acquired. Credit card debt is our main problem. When I was younger I was irresponsible with credit cards, and my wife just recently got in too deep with hers this past year. My wife gets stressed out when it comes to finances and mostly lives in the moment, while recently I have been trying to educate myself on how to get out of debt, plan for the future, and become financially responsible in general. I have developed a plan which I would like be critiqued, and any advice is appreciated. 

I looked over our accounts this past weekend to figure out where we had been overspending, and created a budget for what we should be spending having figured out what we could cut. Below is what my current budget is set at after making cuts. We have typically had some idea of where our money was going, but never really analyzed it until now. Biggest things we discovered is in July we spent $1000 on groceries and $1000 on gas from traveling to visit family in addition to our commutes. We also spent close to $600 on restaurants, which we are trying to cut out from our budget. Meal prepping on weekends is our plan, as well as buying groceries in bulk. 

This is a list of our current debts and interest rates. 

Wife’s credit card: 	$5119.29      $159 min payment 15.99%APR
My 1st credit card 	$9571.11      $161 min payment  7.99% APR
My 2nd Credit Card $4888.07         $87 min payment   12.55% APR
Truck Loan: 		$6465 	         $176/month            9.09% Interest

Our current liquid assets: 

Joint Checking: $2348
Other Checking Accounts: $1065
Savings: $13845
Stocks: $6545

Our Income and Budget:

My wife $725/week after taxes and insurance
Myself $550/week after taxes and insurance
Total Monthly: $5088.96

Mortgage: $1469.34
Groceries $600 
Gas $600 (I commute close to 100 miles a day, wife commutes 60)
Minimum Debt Payments: $583.13 (Credit cards and truck payments)
Car Insurance: $313 (we have three vehicles)
Dog Food/Daycare: $265 
Electric: $125 (average cost per month)
Cable/Internet: $125 (looking into downgrading to just internet and ditching cable)
Fire Wood: $80 (what we need to put away monthly to have enough for the heating season)
Medical: $75
Entertainment: $52 (Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime, Music Subscription)

This leaves $780 unallocated for everything else that might pop up and to put any more money towards the debts. 

For our vehicles, My wife’s car is paid off, I have a station wagon that is paid off, and we have the truck so I can use it for work when I need to. I am a carpenter and need it to haul lumber, but not daily. I had been driving the truck as my daily ride because I needed to fix the brakes on my station wagon. The brakes are now fixed so I am only driving the truck only as needed. Truck gets 13 mpg and the station wagon gets 25mpg, so that is how I am getting our gas budget under control, in addition to cutting unnecessary trips.  

We have a young dog that we send to daycare twice a week to burn off his energy and socialize. He benefits from it quite a bit. When he is not at daycare he comes to work with me. Daycare is about $21/day when he goes. I would be willing to reduce it to once a week and as needed for certain days taking him to work with me is impractical. Leaving him at home alone is not a great option because he would be home alone for 10 to 11 hours. His dog food is $65/month.

My Plan:

We will sell the stocks because they are not really doing us any good while we have higher interest debt. $9000 stays in the savings account as our emergency fund should anything happen with one of our jobs, the house, or anything else completely unexpected. This will give us $12,000 to throw at our debts right away. I think paying them in order of what has the highest interest makes the most sense. My wife’s credit card will be paid first, followed by my second credit card, and the remainder towards my 3rd credit card even though it has lower interest than the truck loan. The minimum payment on the truck loan won’t go down if I throw  money at it, while the credit card minimum payment will. This will leave $7626 on the credit card in addition to the $6465 on the truck, so $14,091 total. I am building a piece of furniture on the side of my full time job which will bring in $2000, and that will also go straight to debt. 

This should free up $246 a month, which we will put towards paying off the rest of the credit card, as well as any overtime I earn since I have not accounted for that in my budget. I usually earn an extra $3-4000 in overtime every year. I am also planning to get my own wood shop at home up and running again and in my free time make small items or pieces of furniture that I can sell on Etsy on the time, and try and land more bigger projects when I can. If I can make even just an extra $100-200 a month on the side that would help.  

Where are the holes in my plan? What have I not accounted for? Should we pay off the truck loan first since it is the highest monthly payment? Does the amount we are putting away for the emergency fund seem reasonable? My wife is hesitant to use what we have in savings and stocks to pay off these debts, and would like reassurance that this is the correct way to go.

BlockChain,What Are the Applications and Use Cases of Blockchains? DOBI Bitcoin ATM listed,"**Note: this is quoted from** [Coindesk](https://www.coindesk.com/information/applications-use-cases-blockchains/) and *Authored by Nolan Bauerle*

Blockchain technology is a revolution in systems of record.

Bitcoin is history's first permanent, decentralized, global, trustless ledger of records. Since its invention, entrepreneurs in industries around the world have come to understand the implications of this development.

The nature of blockchain technology has got imaginations running wild, because the idea can now be applied to any need for a trustworthy record. It is also putting the full power of cryptography in the hands of individuals, stopping digital relationships from requiring a transaction authority for what are considered 'pull transactions'.

For sure, there is also a lot of hype. This hype is perhaps the result of how easy it is to dream up a high-level use case for the application of blockchain technology. It has been described as 'magic beans' by several of the industry's brightest minds.

There is more on how to test whether blockchain technology is appropriate for a use case or not in our guide [""Why Use a Blockchain?""](https://coindesk.com/information/why-use-a-blockchain). For now, we turn to a discussion of the development of blockchain technology for *how* it could be useful.

## As a system of record

### Digital identity

Cryptographic keys in the hands of individuals allow for new ownership rights and a basis to form interesting digital relationships. As we've discussed in our guides [""What is Blockchain Technology?""](https://coindesk.com/information/what-is-blockchain-technology), [""How Does Blockchain Technology Work?""](https://coindesk.com/information/how-does-blockchain-technology-work) and [""What Can a Blockchain Do?""](https://coindesk.com/information/what-can-a-blockchain-do), blockchains provide an opportunity to establish a strong system for digital identity.

Because it is not based on accounts and permissions associated with accounts, because it is a push transaction, and because ownership of private keys is ownership of the digital asset, this places a new and secure way to manage identity in the digital world that avoids exposing users to sharing too much vulnerable personal information.

### Tokenization

For the purposes of authenticating a unique physical item, the items are paired with a corresponding digital token. This essentially means tokens are used as to bind the physical and digital worlds. These digital tokens are useful for supply chain management, intellectual property, and anti-counterfeiting and fraud detection.

### Inter-organizational data management

As stated in our guide [""What is a Distributed Ledger?""](https://coindesk.com/information/what-is-a-distributed-ledger), blockchain technology represents a revolution in how information is gathered and collected. It is less about maintaining a database, more about managing a system of record.

### For governments:

Governments have an interest in all three aspects components of blockchain technology.

Firstly, there's the ownership rights surrounding cryptographic key possession, revocation, generation, replacement, or loss.

They also have an interest in who can act as part of a blockchain network.

And they have an interest in blockchain protocols as they authorize transactions, as governments often regulate transaction authorization through compliance regimes (eg stock market regulators authorize the format of market exchange trades).

For this reason, regulatory compliance is seen as a business opportunity by many blockchain developers.

### For financial institutions:

Read more on this in our guides [""How Could Blockchain Technology Change Finance?""](https://coindesk.com/information/how-blockchain-technology-change-finance) and [""What Can a Blockchain Do?""](https://coindesk.com/information/what-can-a-blockchain-do).

### For audit trails:

Using the client-server infrastructure, banks and other large institutions that help individuals form digital relationships over the internet are forced to secure the account information they hold on users against hackers.

While banks can spend the billions of dollars to keep information secure, the system is currently asking businesses to do the same. We are sharing the same information with these businesses as we are with the banks, after all. Yet, businesses are under attack and have been hacked, resulting sometimes in the exposure of customers' intimate financial details.

Blockchain technology offers a means to automatically create a record of who has accessed information or records, and to set controls on permissions required to see information.

This also has important implications for health records.

## As a platform

### For smart contracting

Blockchains are where digital relationships are being formed and secured.

A consortium of the largest banks in the world, as well as several insurance companies, led by a startup, is seeking to build a platform to establish new digital relationships between banks themselves. Their approach to securing these new digital relationships is a combination of [Ricardian contracts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricardian_Contract) and coded business logic.

In short, this version of smart contracts seeks to use information and documents stored in blockchains to support complex legal agreements.

Other startups are working on sidechains – bespoke blockchains plugged into larger public blockchains. These 'federated blockchains' are able to overcome problems like the block size debate plaguing bitcoin. It is thought these groups will be able to create blockchains that authorize super-specific types of transactions.

Ethereum takes the platform idea further. A new type of smart contracting was first introduced in Vitalik Buterin's white paper, [""A Next Generation Smart Contract and Decentralized Application Platform""](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/White-Paper). This vision is about applying business logic on a blockchain, so that transactions of any complexity can be coded, then authorized (or denied) by the network running the code.

As such, ethereum's primary purpose is to be a platform for smart contract code, comprising of programs controlling blockchain assets, executed by a blockchain protocol, and in this case running on the ethereum network.

### For automated governance

Bitcoin itself is an example of automated governance, or a DAO (decentralized autonomous organization). It, and other projects, remain experiments in governance, and much research is missing on this subject.

Read more about this under 'Politics' in our guide [""What are Blockchain's Issues and Limitations""](https://coindesk.com/information/blockchain-issues-and-limitations).

### For markets

Another way to think of cryptocurrency is as a digital bearer bond.

This simply means establishing a digitally unique identity for keys to control code that can express particular ownership rights (eg it can be owned or can own other things). These tokens mean that ownership of code can come to represent a stock, a physical item or any other asset.

Rules on how these instruments can be transacted can be coded by a blockchain protocol.

### For streamlining of clearing and settlement

In the world of stock trading, we often hear the term 'T+3'. This means, a trade (T) is followed by three days before the trade is accepted (settled). There are non-blockchain ways to get this number down, but not without compromising security and risk.

With blockchain technology, however, trade is settlement, and we have a T+0 equation.

Read more on this in our guide [""How Could Blockchain Technology Change Finance?""](https://coindesk.com/information/how-blockchain-technology-change-finance).

### For automating regulatory compliance

Beyond just being a trusted repository of information, blockchain technology could enable regulatory compliance in code form – in other words, how blocks are made valid could be a translation of government legal prose into digital code.

In the case of banks, for example, this could mean improving efficiency in anti-money laundering (AML) compliance. Blockchain technology can be calibrated to do different things – permit transactions or report transactions of a certain type according to exact rules.

This means that banks could automate regulatory reporting or transaction authorization.

## In short

All of this work is allowing people to secure digital relationships that were impossible before. Data is being disclosed differently, secured differently and recorded differently.

This is changing digital relationships, creating the ability for them to be automated in code via 'smart contracts'.

Forex,US-China Negotiations,"Trade war worries are currently lower, though not completely eliminated.

Fears of a further exacerbation of the trade war between the United States and China are receding amid the news that representatives of the two countries will meet soon to start another round of trade negotiations. This prospect has had a positive effect on Asian stocks so far, allowing prices to increase. Chinese stocks, in particular, have had a strong day. American stocks also increased initially, but lost their gains as soon as Trump spoke against China.

Right now it is not certain how effective the negotiations would be. Just yesterday Donald Trump repeated his claims that China is artificially lowering its currency in order to attract investment and earn capital to cushion the blow of the United States’ tariffs on Chinese goods.

Furthermore, Trump took a swing at the Federal Reserve as well, as he has already criticized them a couple of times for their hawkish policy. According to Trump, raising interest rates and making the dollar stronger is hurting growth. However, the professional economic opinions support the Fed who are very patiently reacting to market trends and fundamentals - the consistent growth and positive reports are a testament to their good work, despite Trump’s comments. Still, this was enough to drag the dollar down and the DXY dropped to 95.49.

Is this worse long term or am I ok?",finance
Bitcoin,Here you have some tips what to consider before investing.,"1. **Choose the platform** you want to use.

There are many different P2P lending platforms. All of them use cryptocollateral to protect your investment. They differ only by fee rates and terms. Just compare several to find out what platform offers the best option.

2. Think about the **investment duration.**

Longer investments bring long-term profits while short investments allow you to reinvest under different conditions. We think that the better option will be a golden mean between both.

3. **Diversify your investments**

Instead of investing one big amount ant a single rate. This can work out but will lower the chances to get higher benefits. Split this amount into several smaller ones, and make investments with higher interest rates at random time.

4. Remember **your past investments.**

Make an analysis of your past investments, point out the good and bad sides of each investment; it will help you to make patterns of the fulfillment of each deal. These patterns can be applied to your further investments that will bring you higher profit accordingly.

5. **Do a double-check of the platform** you want to invest your money with.

Make sure this platform is a reputable and reliable one and it guarantees the security of your investments. Considering all the mentioned above, you can forget the Golden Rule ‘Invest amount you can afford to lose’ and invest amounts that will bring you the highest profit.

personalfinance,Owner Carry Option on Current Rental,"Hey, PF! First time caller, long time listener.

I'm married with no kids, and we currently are living in a rental home that we really like. The owners offered us the option of doing an owner carry agreement to purchase the house, but I don't know enough about real estate to know if it's a decent deal or not. I understand that the interest rate is higher than it would be through a traditional mortgage, but otherwise, it seems like a decent offer. Here are the details:

- Based on purchase price of $79,900 at 6% interest over 15 years, the total monthly payment would be 
$825.74 which includes taxes and insurance at current rates.  (principal and interest: $674, insurance: $70.33, taxes: $81.41)
- Current rent is $895.00
- The house, insurance and taxes would remain in the current owners name until the entire contract is fulfilled.
- Buyer would still need to keep renters insurance as the policy above does not include any contents.
- Lease could be less than 15 years if a re-finance was done with a traditional lender beyond the 5th year of the contract.  The purchase price is derived from the combination of a current appraisal of $84,900 and the County tax value of $75,400.

We have other extenuating life circumstances that will make home ownership a carefully considered decision for us, but I wanted to hear some opinions on the terms of this offer first before going any further in considering it.

Thanks so much!",finance
personalfinance,Wife and I are trying to decide if now is right time to buy a house. 32/married/1 month old child,"Good morning PF!  

I've debated for a long time posting here and I finally decided I need to.  

I spent a lot of time in my 20s with bad financial habits that I just started changing in my late 20s.  
I'm 32 now, married with a 1 month old child.   

Our goal was originally to move to a house (first time home buyers, from a renting position) in July of 2019.  However, this might be a fluid target depending on the advice I get :) 

Financial stats: 
She is in a education job with a union guaranteed salary and I'm in the private sector but both jobs are stable.   

Combined Income:

* My wife and I combined make approx. 120 thousand a year gross.    

Credit score for me:

* Approx. 700 but it seems to fluctuate per Credit Karma  

Credit score for her:

* Approx. 750  

Monthly income:

* Approx. $6800

Rent:

* $1400 per month, all in.  

Utilities/Cell Phone/Insurance:

* Approx. $700

Medical Bills from birth:

* Still coming in but approx $2000  (deductible met for year and out of pocket max met)

Child care costs starting on 10/15/18:

* $900 per month.  

Debts:

* Car loan for me - $387 per month (I'm looking to get it to a lower interest rate)  
* Car loan for her - $210 per month  
* Credit card debts totaling approx. $10,000  

Savings:

* Me - $3400 
* Her - $950  

Inheritance:

* I have approx $17500 coming due this year in bonds.  I am planning to use this towards the down payment on the house.  

I have a goal of having around 10% down for a house - we're hoping around a $275,000 home.  However I forgot about closing costs which would add around another 7500 onto it.  
I'm not sure how feasible it will be to come up with nearly $35,000 in less than a year (with only about 21,000 saved now).  

Borrowing money from my family is a possibility but I wouldn't lead with that.

So the questions I have would boil down to this:  
Where so I leverage my dollars right now?   
Is 10% down on a $275,000 house too much or too little for a first home?  I don't believe I will EVER have the means to put 20% down so please try to steer away from offering that as advice.  I just don't think it's a reasonable time frame for me without us renting for another 5+ years.  
Would I be better off spending dollars on credit card debt while putting less in to savings month over month?  

We just started making a budget in YouNeedABudget and am trying to get this under control.  Sadly the mistakes I made in my 20s are carrying over to my 30s in terms of just not having a solid grasp on finances.  I want to get myself to a better space for my wife and especially my child so I can help him as he grows to learn from my mistakes and not make the same ones.  

Edit:  I should also mark in here - we've been putting a lot of our money over the last few months into our debt over savings to pay down our debt and have a plan in place to have our credit cards paid off before we buy.  If that means we rent an additional year that's fine, we're both prepared for that.

Edit 2:  Thank you all so far for the awesome advice.  It's not been necessarily pleasant reading all the comments but it's been needed and that's what's important",finance
personalfinance,Should I refinance my last student loan or will that do more harm than good?,"I have about $11k left in a Wells Fargo student loan with a variable interest rate. My monthly payments have been going up by about a dollar each month for the last ~7 months and is currently $111. On my last bill, $57.70 was applied to interest and $53.30 was applied to the loan. 
I know nothing about refinancing but I am wondering if it would be beneficial for me. Will the effect the refinancing has on my credit (currently in the high-ish 700s) be worse than the benefit of lowering the loan? Is it possible to lower the total payment that will be due or just the monthly payments? I’m not having a problem paying each month and could probably raise my payment to about $250-$300 comfortably. Ideally I would like to pay less in interest/be more productive with my payments.",finance

politics,Wyoming and Alaska Primaries Discussion Thread,"##**Wyoming**

Wyoming's primary election concludes Aug. 21 as voters decide who will advance to the November general election.

The highest-profile contest is the governor's race, where six Republican candidates are seeking the nomination.

Only one, Wyoming Treasurer Mark Gordon, is a currently in public office. The race also features three businessmen, Foster Friess, Sam Galeotos and Bill Dahlin, and attorney, Harriet Hageman, and a physician, Taylor Haynes. 

Two Democrats, Kenneth R. Casner and Mary A. Throne, are vying for their party's nomination for governor.

Incumbent Gov.Matt Mead, a Republican, has served two terms and is term-limited.

Of the past 10 governors in Wyoming, five have been Democrats, and five have been Republicans.

At the federal level, Congresswoman Liz Cheney is facing challenges from two other Republicans, Blake E. Stanley and Rod Miller. Two Democrats, Greg Hunter and Travis Helm, are seeking their party's nod.

U.S. Sen. John Barrasso is favored against five challengers in his bid for re-election. The victor advances to face Democrat Gary Trauner in the fall.

*Polling places in Wyoming are open from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. on Election Day. Absentee ballots must be received by the county clerk no later than 7 p.m. on Election Day, delivered either by mail or in person.

##**Alaska**

Alaska is headed toward an unusually competitive primary in just over three weeks. And that competition is mostly within the Republican Party.

The 2018 Alaska gubernatorial election will take place on November 6, 2018, to elect the Governor and Lieutenant Governor of Alaska. Incumbent Governor Bill Walker is running for re-election to a second term again as an Independent candidate. 

At the top of the ticket, both of the competitive primaries for governor and lieutenant governor are in the Republican Party. There are seven Republican candidates to be governor and six from the party running to be lieutenant governor.

Most of the attention right now is focused on the leading candidates for governor: former Wasilla Sen. Mike Dunleavy and former Lt. Gov. Mead Treadwell of Anchorage. Dunleavy has built up a lead, according to polls. Treadwell is trying to make up ground, arguing that he’s better qualified.

Candidates from the Alaska Democratic Party, Alaska Libertarian Party and Alaskan Independence Party appear on the same ballot, with the highest-placed candidate from each party receiving that party's nomination. In the primaries for recognized political parties, candidates for Governor and Lieutenant Governor run separately. 

The winners of each respective primary for Governor and Lieutenant Governor then become a joint ticket in the general election for their political party. In October 2017 the AKDP sued for the right to allow non-Democrats to compete for and win the Democratic nomination, which was ultimately decided in their favor in April 2018. This move was widely thought to benefit incumbent Gov. Bill Walker, to foreclose the possibility of a Democratic nominee splitting the vote with Walker against a Republican nominee. However with the entry of former Senator Mark Begich into the race, Walker withdrew from the Democratic primary and forged ahead with a fully independent bid for reelection.

In the House, there are 109 primary candidates running, the most since 1996. Twenty-four of the 29 competitive primaries in the Senate and the House are on the Republican side.

This election is for all Alaskans who are registered to vote to decide which candidates will be on the ballot in November’s general election for the offices of U.S. Representative, Governor, Lieutenant Governor, State Senate and State House.

*This election is in person at your local polling place, even for Anchorage residents. (Go to https://myvoterinformation.alaska.gov/ to look up your polling place). Polling places are open from 7 a.m. until 8 p.m. You can also vote early or absentee.*

*The deadline to update your voter registration for the Primary election is July 22.*

*There are two ballot selections (you may only vote one):
Democratic, Libertarian, Alaska Independence party candidates will be on one ballot that any registered voter can vote, regardless of registered party. Republican party candidates will be on a ballot that Republican, Undeclared and Nonpartisan registered voters can select.*

When googling a position salary, often I come across the same sources: Salary.com, indeed, and sometimes US department of labor statistics.

I’m wondering how true this. If it’s entirely true and these are bad sources, is there any other reliable way for me to determine what my asking salary should be when I seek employment elsewhere? 

According to these sources, I’m making ~$40,000 less than national average for my title with the appropriate duties and responsibilities. If you add in that CoL where I live is ~75% of national average, then when I theoretically should be paid is a bit less than that, but still a not-insubstantial cost to me for the work I’m doing for this company. I need this figure to determine at what price it is worth for me to stay with this employer if they uncharacteristically offer me competitive compensation.",finance

I've always dabbled and had fun looking at things on the front page but never truly made the commitment to be a part of the community until now...

Anyway, this is my current situation.  I'm 26 years old, living in Washington, DC - a toxic place I'm extremely sick of, and I'm looking to make a move to Southern California by next summer (2019). I work for a non-profit making $55k per year. So my monthly income is at roughly ($3200 - $3700) - I just recently acquired a second gig where I bar-tend Saturday nights for some extra cash &amp; so far, it looks like an $400 - $500 additional income. I've been tracking my spending this past month after years of never touching a budget this is what it looks like:

Monthly Income: $3200-$3700

* Rent - $830 (all utilities included)
* Phone Bill - $230 (I help my mom and aunt pay for their bill least I can do for them)
* Internet/TV - $87
* Student Loans: $715 (@SallieMae &amp; @FedLoan)
* Subscriptions: $40
* Groceries: $200
* Transportation: $30
* Credit Card minimum payment: $380

Savings: $90 - I legit don't know how to save money. Should I open an account with a credit union and use that as a vehicle for emergency savings? How do you all usually save money away for your emergency savings?

This month, after talking with a buddy, I was able to actually pay off $600 on my CC debt. Only to be discouraged by the fact that I was charged $253.85 for interest charged on purchases.

So my questions to you are:

1. How do I save and pay down credit card debt, so that I can move out of DC by next summer?
2. I only have one credit card, is it possible to transfer the debt on that to another with no interest?
3. What vehicle do you use for savings &amp; what tips do you recommend for someone first looking to do so?

Super grateful for your time. I'm really ashamed to have fallen under so much debt, when I already deal with my Student Loan debt as is. This feels like an ongoing trap, even though I think I'm doing the right thing to be accountable and diligent. My goal/which feels like a dream lately, is to get to $10k in savings, and my utilization rate at below 30% and not the 94% it's at now.

Again, thanks! All opinions welcome.",finance

personalfinance,Debtor wants my employer to garnish my wages for a debt I didn't know I had and still cannot find.,"Forgive the formatting, I'm on mobile.

My employer recieved a letter asking for my wages to be garnished 25% to pay off a debt of around $850, however he won't let me see the letter for very long because if someone finds out he recieved and knows about the letter he has to start garnishing.

I have a rough idea about what the debt is from, but no one has posted it to my credit, and to be honest no one has contacted me about it in at least 4 years. 

So I have absolutely no leads to go on, and garnishing 25% would put me at way under federal minimum wage. 

How do I track down this debt to start paying it?

Edit: Thanks, guys! I'll see if I can get more information from the letter!",finance
personalfinance,Parents released 529 to me. Confused on taxes.,"Hello everyone!

I have recently completed college. Over the years my mother had saved some money here and there in a 529 plan (Oregon). We mostly used it to pay for books or tuition that was not covered in federal loans/scholarships.

I had considered taking an additional course this summer (between undergrad and grad school) but decided against it. We were planning on using the 529 plan so we left ~$1900 in it to cover the course I never took.

Since my graduate school is funded my mom released the funds to me. I intend to send it all towards my loans however I am still confused regarding the taxes that must be claimed on the account.

From what I understand, one of us needs to fill out a 1099-Q. Since the payout from the company was to me, I am assuming that I must do this next tax season (I was the beneficiary). Am I correct or should my mother be doing this since she payed into the account?

Thanks for all of your help!",finance

personalfinance,Should I get braces before coverage expires or wait until I'm an adult?,"My teeth are not horrible, but they are not great either. They are very crowded and a little bit crooked. I have gotten a few cavities that, according to the dentist, were caused because my toothbrush was unable to reach the area and not preventable on my part. I used that as the reason to ask my parents if I could get braces. The main reason is that it affects my self-esteem to some extent and I would prefer getting it fixed now rather than later. Because of this I have asked my parents if I could get ceramic brackets on my top teeth to make it a little bit more discreet and metal brackets on the bottom.

I am 17 and covered by my dad's employer. Coverage for braces expires when I turn 19. I turn 18 in October, and I am getting bottom impacted wisdom teeth removed sometime in December when I get home from college. That means at the earliest I can get braces is probably sometime in January. I will need a few weeks to recover from the extraction, but the oral surgeon said that I could probably be able to get braces on in 4-6 weeks. If I don't get it in January I will probably not be able to get them on until my next vacation from college in mid to early March. I'm not sure what would happen if I turn 19 while I still have braces on, and when I asked my parents they told me to not worry and we can wait to see what happens.

The main problem is that my parents are dipping into their savings to pay for college for me and my sister. This is only occurring in the two overlapping years where we are both in college (junior and senior year for my sister, and freshman and sophomore year for me), and they will be able to save up again after my sister graduates. The estimated cost of attendance for both of our schools are roughly the same and full need is met for both of them. They do not expect to take on any debt during this period, but I have taken on subsidized federal loans to ease the burden. I will already be 19 when my sister graduates, and by then my parents must pay out of pocket. This annoys me because I remember in elementary school when most people got braces, the dentist told my parents that it was recommended I get braces, but it isn't necessary. When I got the cavities I was blamed for eating too much sugar and not taking care of my teeth properly until the dentist came in and told them it was not my fault. If I had gotten braces in elementary school, aging out of coverage would not be a problem.

I hope to go to law school, which my parents will not be paying for, and will probably not be able to afford them on my own until much later in life but burdening my parents seems unfair. The estimate my parents have heard is $5,000 before insurance, but I think my problems are mild enough that the cost will be less. I have made an effort to look for orthodontal schools in our area that might bring the cost down, but because we don't live near any cities or colleges with dental programs the closest one is three hours away. We make far too much money to qualify for any dental assistance programs. I can't find any other options for making it cheaper.

**Tl;dr:** I am about to enter college and want to get braces partially for health reasons and partially for cosmetic reasons, but my only options are to get them right now when my parents are in a tight spot financially, age out of insurance coverage and have my parents cover it, or pay for it myself at least 6-7 years from now after I graduate from law school, most likely with debt.",finance

personalfinance,An Analysis of Charitable Giving Using Donor Advised Funds,"All,

The purpose of this post is to discuss the purpose and potential use(s) of charitable giving via a ""donor advised funds"" (DAF). I would personally consider this to be a more ""advanced"" type topic in personal finance, but I hope some here will still find it interesting.

**Basic Reminders About Charitable Giving**

Before diving in to some unique points about DAFs, I wanted to give a quick reminder about how charitable giving impacts your finances and taxes. If you're familiar with this, please feel free to skip this section.

Giving money away to qualified charitable organizations (typically called 501(c)(3) organizations) allows you to claim a deduction for your contributions on your federal (and almost always state) tax return(s) for the year in which the donation was made. However, except in a small number of limited circumstances^1, the benefit of this deduction is less than the amount of money you gave away (a deduction is worth $1 * your marginal tax rate - this is about $0.25 per $1 for an average person). This means that you shouldn't give away money ""for tax reasons"" - the benefit you will receive is less than the amount of the donation.

Additionally, to receive any benefit from charitable donations, the sum of all your itemizable donations (mortgage insurance, property taxes, state income taxes, charitable contributions, and a few other less common items) must exceed the standard deduction ($12,000 for an individual or $24,000 for a couple). If your itemizable deductions are way below this threshold, charitable contributions won't impact your federal taxes. However, if you are relatively close to this threshold, a Donor Advised Fund might actually help you make it across - see below for more detail on this (TL;DR - its a basic ""bunching"" strategy with a few twists).

**What is a DAF? Are the Legal?**

I like to think of DAFs as your own mini ""personal foundation"". They are established as charitable organizations whose effective purpose is to store money that can be donated later to other charities (See [here](https://www.nptrust.org/what-is-a-donor-advised-fund) for a good overview). I'll explain why this might be a good thing later, but for now think of them as a ""middleman"" - they hold onto your donation for a period of time and later donate the funds to a qualified organization of your choosing.

Importantly, making a donation to a DAF qualifies an individual to receive a tax deduction for the year in which the funds were donated to the DAF. This is true even if the money is left in the DAF across taxable years and only later distributed to a charitable organization.

After contributing to a DAF, individuals can then make a ""recommendation""^2 to the DAF to distribute the donated funds to various organizations. While there are some limits as to who/what can qualify to receive funds from a DAF, most charitable organizations will qualify and the overwhelming majority of DAFs are able to be used as the donor intends. In this way, a donor makes an initial donor to a DAF (receiving a tax deduction), and subsequently determines the use of the donated funds (but note, there is NOT a second tax deduction at this stage).

Donor advised funds [are completely legal](https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/charitable-organizations/donor-advised-funds) if run properly. However, in the past, their benefits have been abused by some individuals leading the IRS to issue more strict regulation on their use and limitations.

**What are the advantages of a DAF?**

* Separates the timing of the tax deduction from the timing of the ultimate charitable gift - this allows donor to obtain an immediate tax deduction for a large contribution while disbursing this contribution over time.

* Allows donations to grow tax-free while waiting to be dispersed (although no charitable donation is permitted for investment growth)

* Allows a donor to ""save up"" to make a larger donation while still controlling the timing of tax deductions.

**What are the disadvantages of a DAF?**

* The DAF charges an asset management fee (~0.60%) in addition to the expense ratio of the underlying investment.

* Donor surrenders legal control over the funds (see footnote 2).

* DAFs may have relatively high minimums to establish ($5,000+) as well as minimums on donations ($50+).

* Paperwork/administrative complexity for both the donor and recipient organization (certainly not extreme, but worth mentioning).

* DAFs are not exempt from the 50%/30% of AGI limitations on charitable contributions. This means that if you donate more than 50% of your AGI in cash (30% via appreciated stock), your excess charitable deduction will be carried over until the following year.

**Suggested Tax Planning Strategies Using DAF**

With the higher standard deduction under the TCJA, the incentive to [""bunch""](https://www.kitces.com/blog/deduction-lumping-charitable-clumping-tax-savings-itemized-vs-standard-deduction/) deductions is arguably higher than ever. Here, a DAF is an ideal choice - it allows an individual to ""bunch"" as many years of charitable deductions as a donor desires (subject to the 50% and 30% of AGI limits) yet distribute these gifts + interest over time. For individuals that donate a substantial amount to charity, a DAF may allow them to effectively engage in a strategy of bunching and maximize the value of their tax deductions over a multi-year period. 

Further, as with any charitable donation, donating appreciated stock allows an individual to claim a deduction for the full value of the property donated while avoiding capital gains. However, a DAF may also be useful here - while it would be inefficient to donate $100-$500 of stock to different organizations, donating stock to a DAF in a lump sum allows an individual to recommend *cash* donations in smaller amounts to various charities, which reduces their administrative burden/brokerage fees.

**DAF and FIRE (mostly RE/fat RE)**

Since I intended to cross post this to r/financialindependence, I wanted to highlight the potential of DAFs for FIRE minded individuals. The classic hallmark of a FIRE (specifically RE) individual is a high income during working years, a high savings rate, and a long period of relatively low taxable income in retirement. Thus, if charitable giving in RE is important to you, a DAF represents a unique planning opportunity - fund your DAF in your working years when tax deductions have a high value, and disperse the funds over RE when tax deductions have less/no value. In this way, you are effectively ""harvesting"" the benefit of charitable deductions in high tax years even though funds will not be distributed until low tax years.

Taken to the extreme, you could even consider the goal of ""FIRE-ing"" your DAF to provide donations in perpetuity^3.

**Comparison of Popular DAF Sponsors**

As one might expect, Vanguard, Fidelity, and Schwab provide what are, in my opinion, the ""best in class"" DAFs. Importantly, these funds are run by legally distinct entities - i.e. Vanguard Charitable is distinct from Vanguard, etc...

The chart below summarized the key minimums/fees for each provider. My conclusion is that, currently, Fidelity is the best of the best.



Organization| Minimum To Open| Minimum To Add| Donation / Recommendation Minimum| Fees
---|---|----|----|----
[Vanguard Charitable](https://www.vanguardcharitable.org/)| $25,000| $5,000| $500| 0.60% + normal expense ratio; lower fees for balances &gt; $500,000; $250 if under minimum (~$17,000)
[Fidelity Charitable](https://www.fidelitycharitable.org/)| $5,000 | Unclear; ~$50| $50| 0.60% + normal expense ratio; lower fees for balances &gt; $500,000; $100 minimum
[Schwab Charitable](https://www.schwabcharitable.org/public/charitable/home)| $5,000| $500 | $50 | 0.60% + normal expense ratio; lower fees for balances &gt; $500,000; $100 minimum

**TL;DR**

Sorry, no TL;DR for you. I'm examining a complex topic here, and you really should invest the time to read it in detail if you are interested.

O.K. fine, but I warned you: A DAF is a ""charity middleman"" that lets you take a tax deduction today while distributing funds in the future. This lets you choose when to get a big tax deduction and can help you plan your taxes better.

**Footnotes**

^1 In some cases, a charitable deduction actually can be justified solely on economic grounds. For instance, some states allow certain types of charitable contributions to be counted as a *credit* against your state taxes while still allowing you to claim an itemized deduction for such contributions on your federal return. This drives the cost of a charitable contribution down to a very low/potentially *negative* level. While these cases are rare, you should know that they exist. As examples, Arizona allows a $1 per $1 state tax credit (up to ~$1,000) for tax deductible donations made to certain private schools. Virginia allows an ~$0.60 per $1 state tax credit for tax deductible donations made to certain community based organizations. Especially given the TCJA's limitation on SALT, reduction in state taxes may now even be able to be achieved without sacrificing any of the federal deductibility of SIT.

^2 Note that to obtain a tax deduction, an individual must surrender control over the property/cash donated. Thus, legal ownership of the funds resided with the DAF once a donation is made. Donors do not control the ultimate disbursement of funds and instead merely act as advisers. While major DAFs are exceptionally good at honor a donor's intention, you should understand that you have surrendered legal control rights upon transfer to a DAF.

This logic also helps explain the types of donations a DAF won't make - basically any donation where you would receive a personal benefit (charity banquet ticket, etc...). Further, you should be careful when using DAF funds to fulfill a ""pledge"" that you've made. If the pledge represents a legally binding obligation instead of merely an intent to take a future action, a DAF may not be able to release the money to the organization. This can often be solved with wording - communicating to your charity of choice that you aren't making a pledge but are instead including them in your planned future charitable giving.

^3 Although note that DAFs are required, in the aggregate, to distribute ~5% of their assets per year. Thus it is possible that, if the fund as a whole fails to meet this target, the DAF might force you to distributed assets from your ""account"" with the DAF to help them meet this requirement. Currently, this does not appear to be an important constraint on popular DAFs with distribution rates well in excess of 5%.",finance
personalfinance,"[Taxes] Self-employeed, contract worker, working remotely for a foreign (AUS) company while living in the US, can I claim business deductions?","I am about to start a new job as an independent contractor (software development) for an Australian based company. I will be living in the US and be working remotely for them. They are structured as an Australian ""Proprietary Limited"" (Pty Ltd). We have a contract agreement to be paid monthly to my LLC.

My question deals with this [IRS document](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/how-to-report-wage-income-paid-by-foreign-governments-or-international-organizations-for-work-performed-in-the-united-states) in particular. It states:


&gt; U.S. citizens working in the U.S. must pay self-employment tax because the foreign government or organization is not liable for the employer’s portion of the contribution to the U.S. system. However, you are not “self-employed” for any other federal tax purposes. You may not claim deductions for expenses on Schedule C and are not qualified to establish a Simplified Employee Pension (SEP) Plan and there is no allowable deduction on line 28 of Form 1040 for contributions to any such plan.

It later states at the bottom of the page though:
&gt; The term “international organization” means a public international organization entitled to enjoy privileges, exemptions, and immunities as an international organization under the International Organizations Immunities Act (22 U.S.C. 288-288f).

So my question is, does this Australian ""Proprietary Limited"" count as an ""international organization"". And if it does, am I correct that I must pay the self-employed tax, but am not allowed to make any kind of deductions (such as health-care, computer equipment, home-office, etc.)?

Are there any strategies on how to get this tax burden down or perhaps even zeroed out?

EDIT: Roth IRA conversion isn't an option for me because of timing.",finance

personalfinance,"Cars Totaled from Sever Flooding, What's Next?","First post to Reddit, so I'm hoping this is in the correct place. 

I'm from Wisconsin, as of now I believe we are considered to be a FEMA state of disaster. Last night we got a pretty bad storm and terrible flooding. My car was covered in about 4.5 ft of water. Needless to say, totaled. 

I graduated college this year, I do have a job, but literally 2 weeks ago bought a new car (cash up front) so my cash fund is a little low. Don't have comprehensive insurance. 

Firstly, for all you non-wisconsinites who deal with sever whether more often than myself, is there any sort of FEMA disaster fund that I don't know about that could help out with a situation such as this? My insurance company is not recognizing this as sever enough to make a coverage exception. 

Baring my first point, if I do go get a new car my most major issue is due to an event in the last couple years, my school's finical aid office screwed me and somehow I had a loan taken out in my name through my school that I never knew about until years after it was opened, so my credit is quite literally destroyed, right around 500, so taking a loan out on a car seems idiotic, which leads me to these few options:

\- Lease, my commute is short, but I don't want to invest a couple hundred bucks a month in a piece of property I'll never own, seems silly, am I wrong??

\- Pay what I can for a decent car (\~15,000 newish, featureless car) in cash and try to get the rest in a loan and pay it off as soon as I can to avoid my 19% interest rate I was awarded.

\- Pay what I can in cash for a most likely old, high mileage car.

Any advise would be appreciated, thanks in advance!",finance
personalfinance,Stuck with two vehicles after agreeing to be the sole borrower in auto loan.,"**TLDR**: Helped brother out in financing a truck. Brother doesn't want to make payments on it anymore. Now stuck with two auto loans. Need advice.

So about 3 years back I decided to help my brother out in getting a new truck. The only reason I did this is because my brother was living with our mom. He had no way to work and he needed a way to work so that he could help our mom with mortgage payments that she was running behind on.

Anyways, we go to the car dealership and talk to the finance people at the dealership and they check my brothers credit score and find out that its bad. I was aware of this but I had originally planned to co-sign and have him be the primary borrower. The finance guys at the dealership end up convincing me to be the sole borrower and tell me that it's best that my brother not co-sign because it'll make the truck payments more expensive to which they were out of my brothers budget. I strike a deal with my brother and tell him that I would only agree to being the sole borrower of the auto loan if he were to refinance the truck in his name after a year of him paying on the truck.

So the first several months he was on time with the payments but then he carelessly let his life spiral out of control to where he was 3 months late and I had to submit a form to the bank asking them to put my late payments on the back end of the loan.

After those months he finally gets back on his feet and starts paying on the truck again but is constantly late with the truck payments and it affects my credit.

Today I got tired of it and told him he needs to refinance the truck in his name. So then he tells me that he doesn't want the truck anymore and to go ahead and take it and trade it in and left me high and dry with a truck payment that I can't afford. 

Now I'm lost and not sure of what to do in this case and I'm in need of advice.

personalfinance,Advice on how to best repay Parent PLUS loans as the student?,"This past May I graduated from a public university with a Bachelor's in Computer Engineering. For the past three months I have been working as a full time engineer and my employer is helping me enroll in Graduate Studies parttime starting next week. My undergraduate degree was funded by Stafford Loans, PLUS Loans, and small pathetic grants, and those loans are in Grace until November. As I make the higher end of recent graduate salaries and my parents struggle with underemployment, significant medical debt, and support for my two younger siblings, I have agreed to pay the PLUS loans on their behalf every month for the life of the loan, in addition to the Stafford loans. I have a great relationship with my family and I feel personally responsible for the debt obtained for my education, I have no problem with this agreement. My concern is how should I go about paying these loans in such a way that I tackle them the fastest and what are the affects on our taxes?

Currently I have payments set up to the two loan servicers out of my savings account each month. So that's one savings account in my name, one loan in my name, and one in my father's name.

I'm unsure of how this affects our taxes. My parents filed my taxes on my behalf while I was in highschool/college so I'm gearing up to file it myself for the first time next tax season. Taxes are the one thing I just really struggle to understand. I haven't the slightest idea what documents I need and what does and does not apply to both me and my father. No idea where to start. Additionally, does anything special apply to me as a part-time graduate student?

Currently my plan is to set up monthly auto payments for each loan each month, and each month I make additional payments for the maximum I can afford after all other expenses. While the loan is in Grace, I'm trying to start payments now to tackle that predatory interest banked over the last four years.

One thing I'm considering but not sure about is refinancing. Since both my loans are federal loans, I see a lot of warnings about the possible loss of government benefits. But as an engineer in private industry, do any of them apply to me? My credit score is 100 points higher than my father's, so I would be interested in transferring that loan into my name. A loan that big would make me take a hit, but nothing terrible, and I'm not planning and major life changes for the next five years.

My goal is to pay off my ~90k of debt in about 3 years, which is rough but doable with my current lifestyle.",finance
personalfinance,Advice on CALHFA Loan,"Hello All,

I am looking for overall advice for my first mortgage. This will be my first home purchase and I am trying to make the most out of my first time buyers status. I have been pre-approved and I qualify for a [CALHFA Loan](https://www.calhfa.ca.gov/) which helps with the down payment and closing cost. I am looking to purchase a my mothers home for around 200,000. I have been pre approved for up to 225,000. I notice that the CALHFA loans are somewhat higher Interest/apr. I have been approved for 2 different scenarios. [Down payment assistance with closing cost ](https://i.imgur.com/8i1tSpz.png)Interest Rate **5.375% / ARP 6.490%** or [Down payment assistance without closing cost](https://i.imgur.com/PUWEIDK.png) Rate **4.62%/APR 5.750%.**

So here is my questions.

1. Do I use all my savings to cover the closing cost and then have a lower Interest rate / APR or do I take the assistance and get a higher interest rate / APR?
2. Are there issues with these loans that I am not aware of?
3. Is there a better program that I could be a part of.
4. How do these pre approval's look to you all out there?

I only make around 40,000 a year and have a family of 4 to support not counting my self so please understand that it takes me a long time to save up money. I am worried about blowing all my savings on the down payment and closing cost and then having no money in case something happens to the house or a emergency comes up. I believe that I will have close to 10,000 saved by the time I am ready to make the purchase. The purchase of the home is going to raise my overall monthly expenses and I do not want to over shoot myself. I know that some of this will be personal opinions but I am open to hearing it.

Thanks in advance for any constructive input.",finance
personalfinance,Opening a Line of credit?,"What are your thoughts about opening a line of credit for debt consolidation? I have about $60,000 in equity on my 1 year old home. I have about $28,000 in credit card/student loan debt and I was thinking about consolidating them into one loan or line of credit, just to make things more convenient and possibly lower my monthly expenses. The interest rates on a line of credit are lower than my current random credit cards, but that’s a loan against my house, so it concerns me. My goal would be to pay the loan off within 3 years with my annual bonuses and tax returns. Is it worth doing or should I stick with my current plan of paying them off one at a time? The payoff timeline is about the same either way. Does one way look better on my credit profile? Any thoughts are appreciated.",finance

personalfinance,25yo. How do I split my savings into cash for a future down payment vs retirement?,"Hi Reddit,

I just turned 25, making 70K pre-tax annually. I live in a big city in the US and housing prices here are astronomical (average price of a home around $750K). While I do want to save enough for a down payment to buy a home in a few years (5-10 years), I also want to be well prepped for retirement and be realistic about my chances of purchasing a home. I'd appreciate any input into how to split my savings between the two.

Stats:

* $70,000 pre-tax annual income (hoping to increase this to $100K by the time I'm 30)
* $16,000 in 401K/Roth IRA
* $8,000 in emergency fund/savings (4 month emergency fund)
* Currently saving $1,500/month post tax\*\*
   * $500 into Roth IRA (my company does not match 401K, so I don't contribute to 401K right now)
   * $1000 into high yield savings account at 1.75% APY
* Approximately $11,000 in student loans with interest rates of 3.15-4.41%, no other debt

\*\*I know I could easily save more by budgeting, I'm working on getting my spending habits in check to save $2K a month.

I'd appreciate any feedback you have on how to allocate my savings. Thanks!",finance

personalfinance,Help me figure out my student loans?,"I graduated college in 2006, and through a myriad of bad decisions and ignorance (both mine and my parent's), I ended up with almost $80k in student loan debt (20 year payoff) for a bachelor's degree in Business.  Made paying my loans a priority despite 5 years of low-paying jobs and never once missed, deferred, or forbearanced a payment but couldn't afford much more than the minimum payments.

The last 3 years I've managed to put an extra $150-$200 a month towards them, but with two kids in daycare and making $50k a year it's hard.  Currently my loans are this:

Private student loan- $8935 balance at 4.88%

Private student loan- $5914 at 5.48%

Private student loan- $5972 at 4.5%

Private student loan- $6901 at 6%

Federal student loan (already consolidated)- $10499 at 4.5%

When I took these loans out, most were at 2-3% interest rates.  I'm steadily seeing them increase and freaked when one got to 6%.  I have excellent credit, no debt besides this and a mortgage, and never missed a payment so I looked into refinancing/consolidating the private loans.  Despite claims of 2-4% interest rates, my offers came back at 5-8%.  What gives?

Is there any other way to lock in a lower interest rate to pay these off?  I'm committed to paying an extra $200/month towards them (estimated payoff summer 2024), but really want to lock in sub-5% rates for all of them ASAP.",finance
Forex,AUD/CAD: Review &amp; Forecast,"The CAD is still the currency with the most potential against the AUD. The price correction is over, so the deals on the trend will be the most effective.

The rates have stabilized in August and now we can see a steady downward trend in favor of the Canadian dollar. The Australian dollar remains under pressure as a commodity currency amid developments in the trade war between the US and China. In addition, the soft monetary policy of the RBA, which keeps the rate at a record low of 1.5%, has also had a negative impact on the Australian dollar. As a result, the value of the AUD has decreased against the CAD to the level of April 2016. A similar pattern can be observed witth other base currencies against the AUD.

personalfinance,To pay off my rental property or not? What to do!,"Hi team (yes, you guys are my gurus on these topics) -

I own a rental property in a large metro area with a high COL, stable and growing rents, and a huge demand for rental property.

I need your help in understanding if I should start putting large amounts of money towards the mortgage to pay off the home, or if the tax benefits and current situation I am in outweigh that idea.

* Current monthly rental income: $3,200
* Total monthly costs (taxes, HOA, P&amp;I, reserves): $3,000
* Annual mortgage interest paid: ~$16,000
* Mortgage interest rate: 4%

I get a nice tax benefit from the interest deduction and also the depreciation each year. The way I see it, each month, I net about $200 in cash, and the renters pay down about $800 in principal...so $1,000 each month of net benefit.

If I were to pay down this property (or pay off), I would lose the mortgage interest deduction, and then have to pay taxes on the income of the property. 

The money to pay off the balance would come out of my liquid equity portfolios - stocks, bonds, etc which are netting market rates right now (5-8%).

I see this two ways: **no** don't do this because I am making more $ off the market vs. the interest and would lose the tax benefits. Or **yes** pay it down/off and then have a nice income coming through.

Thoughts? Thanks!",finance

personalfinance,Should I open a Vanguard Roth IRA when my employers 403b already invests in several Vanguard funds?

I was in the process of opening a Vanguard Roth IRA due to the advice posted here and elsewhere, but I am wondering if I should open the Roth somewhere else based on the fact that my employers 403b already invests in several Vanguard funds?  My employer uses Valic, and the funds in my 403b are allocated this way:

I had posted this earlier and then removed it as I thought that it sounded too boastful. I’m just sharing to feel included. I can’t tell this to anyone I know IRL so sharing here with people who maybe understand some of this. 

Yesterday was rebalance day, I got rid of some funds and simplified my portfolio a bit and also reallocated some cash and bonds towards equity, and, found that for the first time in my life I have more than 500k in the markets.

I’m also almost half of the way there with my goal. So it warrants a milestone post.

I feel a bit queasy at this milestone. I don’t know if this is good or bad or if it will pass. People with larger sums in the markets, does the anxiousness go away?

Im a regular 35 something software engineer drone at a megacorp. Job is a drag but pays well. I’m in the eu so all numbers are in EUR and represent the combined assets of me and my wife.

I Started 8 years ago with less than 10k.

2010-2013

Got introduced to r/fi and read the ERE book.
Saved on average 50k and got rid of expensive stuff and hobbies, got into minimalism for a bit and lived in extreme simplicity.  

This period was the most frugal I have ever been. Lived with one pair of jeans and only wore swag, ate at campus, packed food to home didn’t go out or on dates etc etc. found a likeminded woman so was easy to not go on expensive dates or vacations.

2014-2015

Got married and became a bit more reasonable about expenses, income doubled with combined finances and frugal lifestyle. Saved about 70k per year(we decided to live within one income and saved the other). I bought a small studio, which is now completely paid off. 


2016-2017

I got lucky with a startup exit and got a 300k pay off. Also started saving about 80k from regular salary plus bonus each year. 

2018

A bonus and Some stock sale round up the numbers. Total 800k. Equity:500k 

I’ve not spent a single day when I don’t worry about not making it to the FI number. Or what the number should be. I worry about the value of stocks and the interest rates and macroeconomics and the trillions of QE by ECB and FED and what it means for my next 50 years. I worry about my peers who seem to be grinning endlessly about some joke that I don’t understand.

Now a bit of background on my situation. About a year ago I was an Executive Sous Chef at a country club working 80+ hours a week. I never got to see family, loved ones, or barely had time to myself, so I left and attended a 3 month bootcamp course for computer programming. Since I didn't have $14,000 just lying around, I took out a student loan, plus another $5,000 for living expenses. After the course was up the job search got slimmer and slimmer until I got a call from an old boss looking for help to turn this restaurant in Utah back around. Me being a broke student jumped on the opportunity. The pay was great, I was making $1200 a week. I had planned on paying off my loans while I was doing very well. Since the Job was out in Utah, I still had an apartment back In Atlanta. So, I had to break my  lease which came out to around $5,000. I was only there for about 3 and a half months so I made almost $17,000. After breaking my lease, trying to pay more on loans, etc, the money just flew by. 

When I got back to Atlanta my mom had gotten really sick while I was away, so I decided to move back in, help with bills, etc. My dad and I almost lost my mother, so since he is disabled I helped them out with bills.  After helping my dad with bills and all I am back to where I started when I finished the bootcamp course. My parents are doing fine now, actually things are looking up for them and I couldn't be happier for them. I found out my girlfriend is pregnant so I need to get all my finances in order. I really don't want my pregnant girlfriend and I living with my parents. I want to do this all on my own, I just need some guidance. I have been saving $100 a week on the side trying to be as tight as I can with money. So she is wanting to get our own place and Im trying to figure out what to do. Should I reconsolidate, get a personal loan? Any help will be so much appreciated. If any more information is needed let me know.

personalfinance,Need Advice In Regards To Car,"Okay. So back in February I signed a car deal that I shouldn't have. I originally had a vehicle that I was having a ton of issues with, I took it back and forth between different mechanics for weeks and nobody could figure out what the issue was. Instead of making a smarter decision or being more patient, I went and got a new car. I travel a lot for work, so I justified the purchase by saying to myself I need a new reliable car because I can't be putting up with this all the time.

​

So, long story short. I have a car payment that is too high. I do not know where I am going to be in 1-2 years time due to being in school and a semi-unreliable job. I currently work full time and I TAKE HOME roughly 35kish a year. My car payment is $469 a month. The entire amount of the loan is roughly 29k before interest. Which includes an extended warranty that I can cancel. I had 3k in rollover from my previous car.

​

I already have about 2k in principle towards the vehicle. Making what I owe left on the vehicle + extended warranty still roughly around 27k before interest(6%). I currently do not really have any other expenses besides my car payment due to living at home still. I am looking for advice on the best path here. I currently have about $4000 in savings. Like I said, I do not have any other expenses currently besides food and the occasional going out.

​

Should I try and cancel the extended warranty, save up some money, sell the car and try and break even and then buy a car for cash? Do I keep the car and try and just pay off the entire thing in a years time? I really do not know the best path to take here. Should I try and get a small personal loan with a low interest rate and sell the car? I currently live at home and have no other expenses but this is something that won't last forever. I will have to be out of the house in a years time. I work in a sales position where my income is becoming more unreliable. Thanks.

​

Edit: Also forgot to include what the car is! It is a 2017 Golf GTI

&amp;#x200B;

Let me provide a little bit more information on the loan.

&amp;#x200B;

The extended warranties I paid $3300 for. I don't know what my return or result would be if I cancelled them at this point.

&amp;#x200B;

So what do you think about Scalability issues? If we want mass crypto adoption the current chains are insufficient. Bitcoin and ethereum blockchains cannot proceed many transactions per second if you imagine how many transactions (many of them with small amounts) can occur at the same time.

Bitcoin,Bitcoin adoption by country: An Analysis,"We set out to answer the question: **is Bitcoin adoption actually as global as some media outlets would have  us believe?** The truth is that most cryptocurrency trading is done on  crypto exchanges or in the over the counter (OTC) market. The problem with these ways of buying Bitcoin is that there is no public  data on how much Bitcoin is being bought and sold in each country.

However, Bitcoin country data is available for LocalBitcoins. It must be noted that the $6.3 billion traded on LocalBitcoins is a  fraction of the global trade volume. Still, there is more than enough  data to get a reasonably accurate idea of the levels of Bitcoin adoption  in specific countries.

# Our Analysis

fter analysis of the 46 country datasets for LocalBitcoins, it appears  that Bitcoin trading on the platform is extremely concentrated. **72% of  all Bitcoin trading happened in the top 5 countries: USA, Russia, UK,  Venezuela, and China.** What exceptionally interesting is that all of the countries making up  the top 4 in the all-time country volume leaderboard have some kind of  problem with their native currencies.

# USA

The first thing to note is that **over the last 104 years, the USD has lost more than 96% of its value.** The era of quantitative easing funneled billions or trillions of dollars  into markets like the stock market and real estate. Massive bubbles  have been formed in traditional markets. With the FED beginning to raise  interest rates, the stage is set for a correction in these traditional  markets. In this sort of environment, it fundamentally makes sense for investors  to look at hedges like gold and Bitcoin for wealth preservation.

**In May 2018, the Ruble had officially lost 9% of its value against the  dollar.** It goes without saying that a 9% depreciation in the purchasing  power of imported goods, is not good news for the Russian people. It appears that Russians are increasingly turning to Bitcoin to hedge against the devaluation of the Ruble.

# The United Kingdom

The problem is that £26 trillion worth of EU derivatives contracts  expire after Brexit. Unless an agreement is made, these contracts are  all at risk. **It’s been estimated that £70 trillion worth of trades could  be impacted after the UK leaves the EU in March 2019.** UK insurance  companies could also lose access to the £55bn insurance market. As of  now, no progress has been made to secure the UK’s access to EU markets  after Brexit.

The future for the UK and its currency looks uncertain. With this  drama unfolding in the background, it is maybe not surprising that more  and more UK residents are turning to Bitcoin to preserve their post-Brexit wealth.

# Venezuela

**Venezuela is heading towards one million percent inflation** and economic Armageddon. Shops are empty, wheelbarrows full of money are being used  to buy normal items and people are dying of starvation. In this environment, it is no wonder that Bitcoin use is on the rise.  Cryptocurrencies are maybe the best way for everyday people to get  around oppressive government controls and preserve what little wealth  they have.

Venezuela is perhaps the best example in the world today that shows  that Bitcoin can be used to hedge against government incompetence.

# Conclusion

Since 2008, many commentators argue that financial institutions such  as the World Bank, European Central Bank, FED and the Bank of Japan,  have done little to solve the underlying problems that caused the 2008  financial crisis.

Hopefully, we’ll avoid another global financial crisis. However, the warning signs are there for all to see. And with a whopping majority of Bitcoin trading being done in just five countries Bitcoin has a long way to go before it can be deemed a truly global currency.

personalfinance,A bit of everything,"Hi everyone. I am kind of stuck as far as what to do. I am currently in a job where I make roughly 83k (some of which is not taxed). I will be leaving that job in April of next year. In the meantime, I have been focusing on building an emergency fund in case I cannot find gainful employment before this job ends. I had a vehicle that I paid off but it was recently totaled in a storm. My current finances are:

43k in a Roth TSP
$7500 in the emergency fund

Expenses:
36k student loan at 6% interest
28k car loan at 0% interest
$1000 rent
$40-70 utilities
$70 phone
$55 internet

I'll admit I spend more on food/alcohol than I need to but I have been actively trying to cut back on that. Lifestyle creep is a real thing y'all.

I add $1500 a month to savings and $500 to the TSP. Everything left over goes to student loans. 

I have a payment coming from my insurance company for the totaled car that I was thinking about throwing at my student loans. 

I think I'm on the right track. I just feel like I need to be doing more. I also don't know if I should just use the insurance money to pay off the car and keep similar pots of money together for the psychological benefits and also because if I end up unemployed worst case scenario I still have to pay the car but not the student loans. But the student loans have a high interest rate and at the end of the day, debt is debt. And the student loans are accruing interest while the car loan is not.

financial,Question About Getting a Loan,"Hi, I'd like to learn about the process of getting a loan so I can move into a home. I make 24k a year. Recently got my first new car but never had credit so I got hit with a high interest rate of 18%. The car is an entry level 2018 economy sedan so the payments for that are affordable enough. I currently live with my parents and we own the trailer that we reside in now. I'm just trying to understand a little bit more of what I should know when getting into looking for a house and a getting a loan for it. Is something like a 50K loan ok for someone like me that makes 24K a year? Trying to figure out what would be affordable. I'm in my mid 20s and have a long time left in the workforce. No kids. Just want to do something better for myself and my family. We used to live in a 2 bd room apt, now a 3 bd room trailer that we own but we don't own the land it's on (community development).

My job recently raised our wages (which I felt was long overdue) because of the tax breaks that large companies recently got. I'm doing better financially than I ever had in my life and as weird as it sounds, it's an uncomfortable feeling. I'm not used to things going this smooth for me for an extended period of time. Before I got my new car, I drove a 2001 Ford Focus that had almost 200k miles on it, with broken A/C and heat for 2 years. All during that time I was saving money for a new car. I knew nothing about buying a new car so I was just worried I wouldn't have enough. When I finally got it, I put a 2k down payment on it and still had a good amount of money in my savings left over.

I say all that to say this, I tend to always overestimate things. Not knowing how things will turn out, I try to always stay prepared for the worst. I work full time, have some benefits (opted out for medical this year b/c I'm fairly healthy), and I'm not too much of a spender, also, no debt (other than me paying my car payment which I'm gonna refinance like a year from now). I want honest answers. Do you think someone like me has a chance of getting a loan and owning a house in today's economy?",finance

We make about $200k gross annually. I'm much more frugal than my wife and would love to budget, but my wife hates that word. She grew up very poor and now that we are comfortable, she shops a lot. Now that we have a baby on the way, I want to buckle down and get something more concrete planned.

I have roughly $280k in loans, she has just about $180k. Our monthly payments are $1140 and $600 right now based on income and that should be about the same until the wife hits the 10 year mark and her loans are forgiven. Should I keep going the course as is until her loans are forgiven then get aggressive with mine or just start now?

cybersecurity,"Interview with Cyber Threat Specialist, John Modica","&amp;#x200B;

# Can you do brief a presentation of you are and what you do and, how many years of experience you have?

Absolutely. My name is John Modica. I am a Cyber Threat Specialist, within the Cyber Threat Intelligence and many other areas of the Cyber Security field. I have 20+ years of experience. I do Part time development for the Kali Linux OS, and I own my own Cyber Threat Intellegence Company.

# Can you explain a little what cybersecurity is?

Cyber Security is a very broad and generlized term. This can include some, but not limited to the following:

Pentesting, Ethical Hacking, CISSP, CRISC, Senior/Junior Executive levels, Information Specialists, Risk Management, Analytical Specialists, and many, many more.

Then you also have all the different industries that require these branches to function such as:

Military, Government, Cell Phone Companies, Health Care Providers, Cable Companies, Manufacturing plants, etc.

# What people need to know about cybersecurity that no one talks about it?

People do not realize the importance of security in general, none the less the basics of Cyber Security. The ethics of keeping good security also works by understanding the vulnerability within your own systems. Some do not realize that what hackers actually do by their illegal activity, is helping companies keep up the security of their systems/networks. Even though we all can hire Ethical Hackers and Pentesters to test our products and such, it is often thought of as a good thing, because it saves us money, and they help us understand where we need to patch up, so we don’t lose any more money in damages. So the importance of having the hackers/attakers is actually very grande. Often times enough, these attacks gives us an idea from an outside perspective.

# How can we protect our computers better?

In this day and age, there really is not a way to actually protect your computers or devices. Deep state will continue to survelle. If a hacker or agnecy wanted to find out who you were and where you are located, they will figure it out. I always say, “To master Offensive Security, One must master Defensive Security” The best thing to do is use tools that will give you the info on your attackers. Signature based IoCs like Snort, Artillery, Fail2ban, Iptables, Honeypots, and other means to identify and log your issues, would be the easiest thing to have. Most people get out of the Anti-Virus business, because its not the viruses/malwares you need to worry about.

# How can we navigate through web more anonymously?

Well, I do not like to be the bearer of bad news, but there is no such thing as being anonymous. You see, the FBI has already infiltrated 98% TOR URLs and spoofed them as TOR HoneyPots in 2013. In 2015 ,the NSA officially was able to decrypt the TOR network and remove the most imortant file that kept it some what encrypted. Number one rule of thumb was to never tunnel normal traffic through the TOR Network. By trafficing normal data using the TOR Network you risk leaking alot of data. Then we have Exit Nodes. Each exit Nodes is known to act like a “MITM”. They are able to see and collect all your data, cookies, and passwords. If you arent using what they call “good exit nodes”, you get flagged. There is also a group called the Shadow Server Foundation. The Shadow Server Foundation scans the entire dark web on 0.0.0.0\*, to check for suspicious DMZ users. They can be found here [www.shadowservers.org](http://www.shadowservers.org/)/ . VPNs also get audited every fiscal year. VPN companies do not want to be held responsible for other individuals illegal activities.

# For the people who want to begin to learn cybersecurity where should they start?

I suggest learning everything you can. Keep up-to-date with threat reports, upcoming threats, and other news. I also suggest getting certifications, and a degree of somekind to help your resume. Good info can be found on [www.cybrary.it/](http://www.cybrary.it/). Always have a good sense of Defensive security before you get on the Offesive side.

# What kind of mistakes people do, when they begin to learn cybersecurity?

The biggest mistake people end up doing is, following and believing in other people online with fake aliases. They give out WhatsApp, Email, and other sensitive information in public places.

# What advice you can give to those people?

The most vital advice I can give those people is to make sure you evaluate the people you speak to online. Things like e-mails, and WhatsApp accounts can be hacked easily. Some people have credit cards and bank information tied to e-mails, as they give up this identity, freely to others. People just give out far too much personal information to relative strangers. K.I.S.S (Keep It Simple Stupid).

# What books about cybersecurity you recommend?

This is a very general topic. For example, you have the different industries (Health IT, Manufacturing Plants, Car Companies, Cell Phone Companies, Cable companies, State and Federal Governments and their different agencies). You also have the different level of branches and departments (CRISC, CISSP, CTIO, CTO, CEO, SEO, CCNA, Risk Managment, Breach Specialists, ETC). What I can say is, being that Cyber Security is an extentive and broad area, explore a specific aspect you are interested in, and find books related to it.

# Can you brief explanation about what is deep web and, how we can acess it?

Deep Web is a government controlled part of the internet located on the DMZ, or De-Militarized Zone, where they have websites hosted for BlackMarket, Drugs, Pedophillia, Weapons, and other illegal activity. Some places on the Dark Web has been hosted for hacktivists to use as journals. All of which is being watched. Normally to access it, you need grab the Tor Browser and privoxy. But as I mentioned above, it is no longer encrypted. Some people ruin it for others.

# How Tor works?

The best answer can be found here:

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tor\_(anonymity\_network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tor_%28anonymity_network))

But again, it is no longer encrypted. As long as you traffic normal data using the decrypted network of relays, Tor does not prevent an online service from determining when it is being accessed through Tor. Meaning places like Facebook, and other services can see you are on it. Thats why it was never meant to use for normal data.

# Do you think people should visit deep web at least one time and why?

No, I do not think anyone needs to go onto the dark web. Simple curiousity can take a dark turn quickly because the deep web is actively being monitored by many entities. Your true identity can be found using the TOR HoneyPots. The DMZ and TOR was originally created for the government, by the government to send and recieve information. If they created it, why would anyone think its “anonymous”.

# Is the deep all bad?

No, not all. However, good or bad, it is being monitored.

# Does Mariana’s web exist?

I don’t think I should answer this one. PIZZAGATE should be enough to answer this.

### What programming language you think people should learn to begin the hacker path?

There is many languages to learn. To be honest, the original Fortran language can help you learn the bases of all of the languages available.

# What hacking books you recommend?

They is too many books available. All information is good information. Each tool has their own books, for the most part. My own personal resource liberary contains 10,000+ volumes that I refer to regularly. However, I caution anyone getting “free” books from unknown online sources, i.e (social media platforms). These can often lead to bad URLs.

# What being hacker means?

Being a hacker means to have your own scripts, learning new things everyday, being the first to find a bug, patch, or exploit. People today do not realize that using other peoples tools doesn’t make you a hacker. Maybe a pentester, but not a hacker. Using other users scripts and such just means you follow directions well.

# What motivates you?

Helping, and giving advice motivates me. I personally enjoy motivational speeches and music.

### What’s your definition of sucess?

The definition of success, to me, means not taking “no” as an answer. Do not give up, try harder, and look forward. Persue your ideas and passions. The past is not a mistake, it is an experience

Whether that's in Roth, 401k, Stocks, exc.

personalfinance,Credit card debt consolidation question,"Looking for some advice on credit card debt consolidation.

My wife and I currently have about $29,000 in credit card debt right now between 5 credit cards. 

Two of the cards we recently opened and transferred $7,500/Ea. from existing cards and are 0% interest until November 2019. Both of them have $15,000 credit lines.

The other 3 cards are as follows: 

$8,500 balance @ 14.5% ($17.5k credit line)
$2,200 balance @ 21.75% ($20k credit line)
$3,000 balance @ 22% ($5k credit line)

Current credit score is 738, annual income is $160k. Our current spending budget leaves us about $1,000/month to pay credit cards with.

My question is should we get a personal loan for $29,000 for 36mo (assuming 6.99% apr, $865 monthly payment) and just pay off all of the credit cards and be done with it in 3 years.
 
Or 

$14,000 personal loan for 36mo (assuming 6.99% apr, $510 monthly payment) and then pay $500 monthly between the two $7,500 balance cards at 0% interest, and then transfer the remaining balance to another 0% interest card in December of 2019 which would give us another approximately 15 months of 0% interest? This would take about 3.5 years.

Or??

We have 4 other credit cards with 20%+ interest rates but zero balances. Should we close those or will that hurt our credit scores? How many is too many cards?

Do not want a HELOC or to pull equity from the home, refi interest rates are higher than what we’re locked in at.

personalfinance,"Lesson learned, should've known better. Car loan advice?","I made a poor decision in a rush and now it seems like I've screwed myself over.

I put 10k down on a new car (used a friend's employee discount, turns out I should have run the deal without the discount too because the dealership can't make any further concessions if you use an employee discount, and you can't get their super low financing. I was exhausted and I know I should not have accepted this...ALWAYS bring a friend or family member car shopping with you because they are not emotionally invested in the car and they will see things more clearly than you might). 

Aside from not exploring my options with foregoing the discount (and buying new instead of used...in my defense the used ones on the lot were close to the same price because next year's models are about to come out and it's a Hyundai so it holds its value pretty well), I made another mistake. I wasn't even planning on buying a car that day. I was thinking of biting the bullet within the next few days, after many months of wanting to get rid of the P.O.S. I already had. But then I found out my existing car still wasn't fixed (it had been in the shop). So instead of getting pre-approved with my bank like a normal responsible person (and like I did when I bought my existing car used a few years ago), I let the finance guy apply to lenders for me. My FICO score was around 800 (a little below or above depending on the bureau). I went for the longest term possible knowing I make good money and I'd rather have the freedom of a lower payment (in case I find myself without the well paying job I have now) with the ability to make additional payments and pay it off sooner as I did with my first car several years ago. Hyundai finance guy (aka the devil) assured me the interest rate wouldn't matter much if I wanted to pay it off sooner. As it stands I'll be paying around $3k in interest over the life of the loan, which ended up being with BMO Harris, which I'd never heard of until then. 

I just got the bank's payment coupons (but no statement or bill...for real...) in the mail. I tried to enroll online with them but their site is a hot mess and sends me around in circles. When I try to enroll it tells me I can't enroll and I have to go to this other page. Which goes nowhere. Whatever. I'll have to call them tomorrow to sort it out. In the meantime, I did some research on BMO Harris and it turns out they're a terrible auto lender, tons of fees including those for early payment and online payments? I can't confirm anything because I am not yet enrolled. I paid off my bought-new Corolla early several years ago through Toyota's financing and had no issue. I also read BMO Harris has bad customer service in general and people have had trouble getting their vehicle titles from them, and their call center reps vs. online tell you different amounts for your next payment...the list goes on. I do not feel comfortable with this lender. If possible I'd like to refinance with a more legitimate bank. I do most of my banking with Chase but I'm open to any reputable institution. A few questions though, as I have never refinanced before. I did some soft checks online and it looks like I may able to get a slightly lower rate, but I wasn't seeing which specific lenders; it was just through clearinghouses/brokers, not the lenders themselves. Honestly, at this point, I will be fine moving to a non-shady lender at the same APR (even at a shorter term and with higher monthly payments) if I can pay off my loan early if I choose to. I just want to be able to trust my bank. I feel super sketched out right now. These are my questions:

&amp;#x200B;

1. My current loan is for about 17k (car was about 27k after taxes etc. and I put 10k down). If I refinance, will I be refinancing 17k or 20k? (about 3k in interest was factored into the car loan so in the end BMO thinks they will get about 20k from me). I read they do not appreciate people paying their loans off early so I am assuming this will hurt. I received no lender-specific paperwork or terms with my car deal, which is all on a USB flash drive. Just the dealer-standard ""once you drive this off the lot you have to pay for it"" stuff.
2. I read refinancing auto loans is pretty common for when you don't get a great initial rate. Since I put 10k down, I'm not upside down. Is this good in terms of getting a better rate? Or just getting approved in general?
3. Anyone had personal experience with BMO Harris auto loans? Any pointers besides ""run the other direction""? Are they maybe not that bad?

I have the day off from work tomorrow so it would be a great time to talk to other lenders if refinancing is the way I want to go. Any advice from redditors would be helpful. Again, please refrain from telling me I'm stupid for buying a new car, not getting pre-approved first, etc. I'm uncomfortably aware of that :)

I've already written their general manager a strongly worded email for sending me to such a shady lender when I have great credit and was putting almost 40% down on my car. But I know ultimately the responsibility is mine, so I'm trying to make it right on my own.

Edit: sorry, I thought I posted the interest rate! It’s 5.5%.

Edit 2: the dealership called me back and said BMO Harris is one of the most used banks in my area (Phoenix AZ) and that prepayment penalties are against state law. Feeling a lot better.",finance

I make about $24 an hour, it’s my first “big” job as a nurse. I have decided to claim tax exempt on this upcoming paycheck. At what point will I have to pay back taxes in April? For example at low $30,000 a year or etc? I have probably made under 10K till this point this year because I was in nursing school. I just don’t want to have to owe money come April, I read somewhere you might pay more now and get back more in April or pay less now and get less in April? I posted this on another sub as well, this is the same as my Georgie withholding right? On my pay stub it will say Georgia withholding: (it will be blank) but before I did this it would be form example $120 and my federal still says $50-60. I always just thought I would pay the taxes either now or later? 


Update: just to be clear I have only done my last 2 pay checks with the tax exempt.",finance

I have $10k to put down immediately, and would have another $4-$5k once I sell my current car via private party in a month or so. I’d be looking to pay off the remaining $2k-$3k over the next few months. Current credit score is 820. I’ve never done this sort of thing before. I’ve always bought my cars outright with cash. When I open a CC, I look for the best rewards programs and pay no attention to interest rates because I pay off my cards in full each month.

Our combined income is 87,500 and we have no debt other than 1500 remaining note on a car. The mortgage with tax and insurance is 960 a month.

financialindependence,Journey to FI from an African perspective (27Yr Male),"**Backstory &amp; Context**

I’m a 27-year-old male who lives in Zambia, a southern African country you probably haven’t heard of and that’s a good thing. I’m a Software Engineer by profession and have been working since the age of 21. During this time, I have been able to complete my master’s degree (2016) and buy my own plot of land for 118,000ZMW/$11,800 (2017). I have zero debt and I’m also the primary breadwinner supporting both my parents (retired with no passive income) and a sibling. 

&amp;#x200B;

My countries economy is primarily cash based. Most items, including cars and property, must be bought up-front with very little wiggle room. Credit cards are extremely rare and debit cards are the norm. Several banks and institutions do offer mortgages however they are ridiculously expensive, and most individuals don’t bother with them and construct their houses over a period of 2 to 5 years.

&amp;#x200B;

My take home salary is around $2,900 per month, it terms of PPP that’s equivalent to netting $7,700 in the USA ([http://salaryconverter.nigelb.me/](http://salaryconverter.nigelb.me/)). Locally, it’s a significant amount of money.

&amp;#x200B;

My current net worth is 368,000ZMW/$36,800 or in $98,000 PPP.

&amp;#x200B;

**Awakening (2017)**

Being financially independent or retiring early was a completely foreign concept for me till early 2017. At this point in time I got a job at a bank and it completely changed the way I looked at finances and income in general. For starters, everyone was much older than me (average age of 55 in the IT department, I kid you not) and by extension already planning for (if not already transitioning into) retirement.

&amp;#x200B;

In this organization, every other member of staff was either the owner of multiple rental properties or a farmer. Furthermore, working with the Financial Markets department introduced me to government bonds and securities, which were a safe and lucrative form of investment. Being exposed to all of this made me feel like I was sleeping at the wheel and just coasting through life (despite being relatively “successful” for my age).

&amp;#x200B;

I have since formulated an “investment roadmap” and created a detailed budget with all projected monthly incomes and expenses laid-out  till December 2026 (Age 35).

&amp;#x200B;

**Step 1 - No Rent and less family expenses (2018 - 2019)**

Phase 1 is to get the heck out of my parents’ house and into my own home. Yes, I still live with them which is a drag, but it also allows me to save 70% of my net income &gt;\_&gt;. As mentioned earlier, I am the sole bread winner and cover 80% of all family expenses, my mums Cake business tops out the rest. Regardless, I am beginning construction of my house this October and expect to wrap up by Mid-2019. Once complete I will move out and won’t be burdened by rent. The total cost of construction will likely top out at 400,000ZMW ($40,000).

&amp;#x200B;

Beyond that, I will help my parents complete a rental property which is currently at roof level. I have already contributed to this project in the past and when all is said and done I would have contributed about $8000 in total. Apart from my parents owning 1 rental property by the end of 2019 they will also begin constructing two more structures once they receive their full retirement benefits in 2020.

&amp;#x200B;

Basically, my parents will be able to support themselves and I should be able to continue saving at least 65% of my take home salary in 2019 and beyond (Age 28).

&amp;#x200B;

**Step 2 – Government Treasury bills (2018 - 2026)**

All Government securities have very competitive rates. Basically, the Bank of Zambia has auctions every fortnight for both competitive and non-competitive securities. See, [http://www.boz.zm/2018-treasury-bill-results.htm](http://www.boz.zm/2018-treasury-bill-results.htm) for details.

&amp;#x200B;

In August 2018, Treasury Bills of 91, 182, 273 and 364-day duration netted yields of 12.5%, 15%, 18.5% and 19.0% respectively. I invested 120,000ZMW ($12,000) into a 364-day T-Bill and will receive 142,000 ($14,200) at maturity in August 2019, minus 15% withholding tax on gains. My “grand plan” is to invest an additional 200,000ZMW ($20,000) per year  into my principle account till the age of 35.

&amp;#x200B;

Assuming the interest rates remain within the historic ranges of (16 to 21%) and inflation stays reasonable I can expect a net income of $30,000 per year, or $2500 per month, by 2026 (Age 35). At that point I will have the option to retire if I wanted to and still maintain a very good quality of life. In terms of PPP, my net monthly income from capital gains alone should be the equivalent of roughly $5,500 in the US.

&amp;#x200B;

Assuming things don’t go according to plan I could delay retirement for another 5 to 7 years (lame) and call it quits in my early 40s. Either way, I now have a clear plan to get out of the rat race in at most a decade.

&amp;#x200B;

**Investment 2- US Company Stocks. (2018 - 2026)**

I’m in the process of completing paperwork which will allow me to purchase stocks from several US Based exchanges. As a non-resident “alien” I will not be required to pay any US capital gains tax (yay).

&amp;#x200B;

I have done research on a handful of companies which I intend to hold value stocks for relatively long-term gains. This won’t be my primary investment but merely a backup in case my local currency was to go to hell or something crazy happened (#TIA).

&amp;#x200B;

I plan on beginning with a modest amount of $3000 in 2018 and based on my performance contribute an additional $2000 to $3000 per year till 2026.

&amp;#x200B;

**Investment 3 – eCommerce. (2020+??)**

Being a software engineer by profession I do intent on transitioning to selling my own products and services soon. While this is merely an idea for now I’m confident in having the bandwidth to peruse this as I gain more financial flexibility and thus free time.

&amp;#x200B;

**Variables**

* A wife and kids could seriously affect my projections. Hopefully she and I will have the same outlook on life and at least a similar income level &gt;\_&gt;
* Economy goes to hell
* Country goes to hell
* World goes to hell

&amp;#x200B;

**Conclusion**

I had absolutely no plan for retirement till last year. Honestly, I still cant believe I was operating on autopilot for so long. I now have a clear goal, clear metrics to measure against and a set target date. Sure, things may not go according to plan but at least I'm no longer winging it. Assuming I hit my target I plan to spend my free time investing, volunteering, traveling, occasionally consulting and playing Battlefield.",finance

personalfinance,"Getting married soon, would like feedback on financial outlook and expenses","Hi r/personalfinance! Quick shout-out to thank you all for your contributions over the years- I find them very helpful.

I'm getting married next week and we want to start trying to have a baby on our one year anniversary. Thereafter, we have a goal of buying a home in the $250-350k range in the suburbs before the end of 2020. I'm 26 and she is 27.

​

Financially speaking, I think we're set pretty good but my fiance (who is a bit clueless financially) thinks we have no money. We have no CC debt and I have $45k in grad school debt. She has no debt. My salary is $50k now, but will be $85k plus anticipated bonus of around $5k when I start my new job in a month. Her salary is $75k and she's looking to get a better job paying around $85k. She will work full-time until we have our child, at which point she'll probably go part-time 2-3 days per week. We are both professionals...she's in the medical field and I'm an attorney (and I'd expect my salary to be double what it is now in 5-6 years). Credit score is around 760-780.

We have approximately $40k in savings. I have $7k saved away for retirement in a ROTH IRA and 401(k). She has a 401(k) with about $10k. We anticipate receiving around $10-15k in wedding gifts.

Here are monthly expenses:

\- $1750 base rent

\- $100 utilities

\- $400 parking lot for 2 cars

\- $150 for cell phones (this includes equipment rental financing at 0% APR (did the T-Mobile BOGO deal)

\- $90 car1 insurance (fully owned car with 80k miles)

\- $100 car2 insurance (fully owned car with 120k miles)

\- $800 my student loan payments (refinanced @ 4.99% over 7 years. Minimum payment is $720 but I'm paying a bit extra now. Most of my payments go directly to the principal. I'm considering refinancing once married and with my increased income and credit score, hopefully able to get interest rate down to 4.5%. Worth it?)

\- $50 Netflix, Spotify, Prime

\- $100 TV/Internet

\- $50 gas

\- $200 groceries

\- $250 eating out

TOTAL: $4040

​

Our after-tax earnings should be roughly $9k per month, so that leaves us with roughly $5k to play with. Ideally, I want to throw as much money at my student loan debt as possible- perhaps $3000 per month over the next year. That would knock it down to $10k left. We also need to siphon off some of our $40k in savings specifically for an emergency fund that I'll leave in a 1.8% APY Ally account. 3 months' expenses is approximately $15k.

We're also considering moving out of the city in the next 6 months to a cheaper apartment with free parking. That could save upwards of $500/month.

​

Do you think our plan and general timeframe makes sense? Do our monthly expenses look realistic? Do you agree with my fiance, who thinks we ""have no money"" or do you agree with me that we're pretty good financially?

I'm also moving at the end of September and need to cover the deposit for my new apartment. My budget currently has no real wiggle room. I have applied for and been denied assistance as my income is just above the limit. 

I think my only way to come up with the damage deposit is to put all expenses I can into my credit cards. I have two cards, both with $300 limits and interest rates of 24.99 and 33%. Not great, I know, I'm working on rebuilding my credit. The two cards are currently fully paid off, as they typically are. I could put my gas and groceries all on the cards, make the minimum payments in September, and have the money available in my checking account for the deposit. It would take about 3 months at my increased income to pay the cards entirely off. 

The only other options I can think of would be pawning stuff or personal loans (which I've looked into and would still have a 25% interest rate anywhere I've looked). 

I realize I haven't included my whole budget here, but trust that as a struggling single mom I have cut everything I can. I do have cable and internet, because the fee to end the contract is high enough that I'd rather just keep it. I have no car loan, shopped around for insurance, grocery shop at aldi and don't go out. My cell phone is covered through work, and my son and I have state insurance. The child support I receive is within the range suggested by my state's calculator.

personalfinance,Moving money from Simple IRA to Roth IRA,"​

My wife and I made less money this year compared to others (unpaid maternity/paternity leave). This puts use in a lower tax bracket than we are normally in.

Based off of our deductions, we are about 15K away from the 22% federal tax bracket.  We currently have money in both of our retirement accounts (simple IRA etc.) but none in a Roth IRA.

What are the benefits/drawbacks of pulling money from a Simple IRA and putting it in a Roth IRA (up to the max \~5k) for this year. I understand that there is a 10% penalty. So the money that we would pull would be taxed at a 12% federal rate plus the 10% penalty which would be at the 22% rate (plus state taxes etc.). Any other year it would not be worth it but maybe under these circumstances it is?

Our long term thought is to have a balance between our pre/post tax retirement accounts.

Additional information: We are in our 30's. We put in about 10% of our salaries (which includes employer match) into our IRA's. We do not have a large amount in there but also do not have any debt. Ideally we will eventually put in 15% each but daycare is eating a large chunk of our income for the next few years.

Any thoughts would be appreciated!

personalfinance,Advice regarding mortgage possibilities for first house,"Throwaway for privacy concerns.

So, some context, we're a 27 years old couple (married) living in the Netherlands, and work in IT with decent salaries, totaling \~7k net per month and we are looking into buying our first house and considering our options w/r/t taking a mortgage. 

Our savings situation is not as good as we want it to be (for many reasons) so we pretty much have enough to cover all purchase expenses with a few grands left, but good news is that we can save up quite quickly now because of recent salary increases.

Now comes the tricky part, if you're not familiar with the current situation in the Netherlands, house prices are increasing at a crazy rate, so a decent well located apartment (&gt;90 square meters) is at around 400K, people who bought a few years back are making crazy profit now which probably won't be the case for us because even though the market hasn't reached its peak we still don't know how long this craziness will last.

We had a few meetings with financial advisors and from all calculations, we can take a mortgage of up to 650K but of course we don't want to max it out for the sake of being financially responsible. so we ended up setting a max of 450K which we already consider quite a lot. but quite recently we stumbled upon a nice house going for almost 500K and we're reluctantly considering it.

and now we're mainly split between two ideas: 

A/ Buy something smaller and cheaper with a lower price range  300-350K as a first purchase, which we can sell in a few years and hopefully make a minor profit with it and have more money set aside to be able to buy a better property (say at 500K) but we would have to borrow less and have more of our own money to put in (so get better interest rate) 

&amp;#x200B;

B/ Go now with a property at 500K for which the monthly payment would start at \~1600 which is 300 euros more than our current rent. and the advantage here is that if for some reason selling the house becomes non-beneficial in the future, we could definitely see ourselves living in that house for the full length of our mortgage (which would be fixed for 10 years only).

and obviously buying a bigger better house in a nice neighborhood would improve the day-to-day life. 

&amp;#x200B;

We would appreciate all input and sorry for my writing, it has been a while I haven't written something that was't code.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: we theoretically can afford a nice house in a nice neighborhood but not sure it would be a financially sound and responsible decision.

I've been working with a broker and they have found a Portfolio Lender who is willing to give us the loan.  They're coming in at an interest rate of 6.5% fixed for 7 years and adjustable after that (LIBOR + 2 or 3, I'm waiting on final margin number from broker).

I know conventional rates are significantly lower (4.5-5.25%) but given that it doesn't appear to be an option for us, is it stupid to agree to a 7/1 ARM?  What questions should I be asking about adjustable rate given it's LIBOR+margin on a yearly basis?",finance
personalfinance,A question about Roth IRAs,"Hi. I'm trying to open a Roth IRA for the first time and I had a question about how much I could put in. I've made a little over 8,000 dollars this summer. Am I allowed to put in the full 5,500? The reason I ask is because I was reading the IRS's website and they say that your contribution can't be more than ""your taxable compensation for the year, if your compensation was less than this dollar limit."" This confuses me because I'm pretty sure I didn't make enough money to pay federal taxes. Is this still considered taxable income? Thank you for reading this.",finance
personalfinance,Which is better: Paying down or Paying off.,"I know  PF prefers to complete pay off loans but, I have graduated with 3 federal Navient student loans which I could completely pay off in the next 6 months. 

But after researching and my understanding it would be better for my credit score to pay them down to about 10% and countiuing to pay the remaining amount for the term.
The reason why is that closing the account would put a drastic hurt on my credit score. The oldest loan is a federally subsidized loan that has been marked as ""paid on time "" for the last 4 years. The other 2 loans are 1 and 2 years younger with the same attributes. These loans will be on grace until November. 

2700 @ 4.6% 4 years old
1750 @ 4.29% 3 years old
5,500 @ 4.45% 2 years old

Paying these off would almost be half off all my opened acounts. I have 3 credit cards with no balance, ( 2 year, 1 year and 0 year) and a car loans ( 8500 @ 1.99).

personalfinance,Young In-Debt College Grad Applying to Medical school,"I (21 yrs) graduated in May of 2018 with a Bachelor's degree from a decent University. Am currently applying to medical school and have been spending insane amount of time and money sending out applications, hoping to start school in Fall of 2019 (applying is a year-long process). This leaves roughly 12 months to manage finances and decide where to focus saving/paying off debt. Live with my parents and am lucky enough to not have to pay rent/food/insurance. Here is a summary of my income/debt:

Income: 

$16.00/hr as a medical scribe, 30 hrs a week (take home ~1400 per month)
$10.00/hr side job doing lawn maintenance for neighbors 
(Take home ~240 per month)

Expenses:

$120/month payment on low-miles 2011 used civic 
(1600 on loan remaining)
$294/month in federal loans from undergrad that I will need to start paying in December ($34,362 total at 4.3% interest rate)
$37/month gym membership
$12/month netflix account
$60/month in gas

PLUS:
$200-400 for interview clothing 
$1500 for traveling expenses for interviews
$1600 for a new laptop
$2000 for apartment stuff (have never lived on my own so I have nothing) and for the deposit on a place (unsure how expensive because it will depend where I get in to school and have to live).

Currently I have about $800 in a savings account that is my rainy day fund. Have a 720 credit score. Almost all of my money has gone to application fees. I am only now making money that I can start saving. 

How bad does this look? It seems incredibly overwhelming to me. Do I try to pay off my remaining car loan before med school would start? Should I make minimum payment on school loans since I won't have to pay them when I am in medical school? How much should I aim to have saved by August 2019?

Any suggestions are helpful. Thanks.",finance

personalfinance,Questions about tax deduction and credits,"Last year. 2017, I owe the government a pretty 10k because I had my federal allowances to 4, total income was a bit over 180 (2 income, myself and spouse) and I sold a stock for 20k profit.  My tax accountant suggested that I changed the allowances from 4 to 1, which I did. 

So this year. Base Income is about the same. I'm not selling any stocks this year for profit but has lost about 3k this year in my quest to learn options trading. I just got a tesla and will be using the 7500 tax credit. Because of this, I have changedy allowances to 6. Additionally, I'm looking to get solar panels, which I have been quoted another 8300 tax credit and was told that this can roll into 2019 if I don't use it all in 2018.

Lastly, im on a retainer contact at my work place. This contract guarantee me a specific fee for not looking for any new jobs until the firm can close their deal. On top of that, I'm getting two bonuses this year. One from current company and a smaller one from the new company.

My question is: how should I go about adjusting my tax so that I can utilize all my tax credits and come out pretty close to even?

personalfinance,Trying to fix my very tight budget,"I’m in a need of a bit of personal finance advice.  For well over a year I have made it a point to not really spend any unnecessary money to be frugal when grocery shopping and to just pack away any money that I can. I am not doing horrible but I feel like that maybe there is a better way I could be doing things or that there are possible options I can look into like refinancing or something (really anything at this point). 

This is what my financial situation looks like.  

I make about $1400 bi weekly and my bills and debt look like this on a biweekly scale. 

$680 to daycare   

$200-$250 to a credit card (currently owing a little under 10k. 16.74% interest rate)     

$50 -$100 to a furniture loan ( currently owing $856)     

$200 to my car ( currently ahead on payments until January 2019 owing about 12k)     

$100 -$150 grocery’s (feeding a family of 3)     


I am trying my hardest to save money to build up and emergency savings account. I currently have a reminder to transfer any additional money I have before my next pay period to savings. Sometimes I have $100 left over and some times I only have $2 to put into savings. But I make it a point to put something away. I feel like I’m making some improvements but I’m still incredibly stuck in where I am at. I have student loans that I thankfully don’t have to pay back yet but I can’t imagine what will happen when I have to. Any sorts of suggestions is appreciated. 

Edit: Some additional helpful information. My credit score is currently at 695. The thing that’s really impacting it is the high amount of usage in my credit card. Everything above is all of my bills. The housing, utilities, and phone bill are all taken care of and aren’t part of my budget.

personalfinance,Wanting to save for a house,"I'm currently 23 (turning 24 soon) and earning about $1,230 per paycheck AFTER taxes (Biweekly). I have $1.5k in my checking account, $6k in my savings account, and $1.2k in my ROTH IRA (I had just contributed this year). My job does not come with a 401k so I have no employer match to take advantage of.

I have about $17k in student loan debt. The minimum payment is about $195 per month, but I have been paying $300 a month (extra amounts going to the highest interest loan group) to try to get out of paying 4.5% interest (the highest group). The other 3 groups have a 3%-4% interest rate.

I split rent and utilities with my girlfriend which averages $600 a month for my half. We also split groceries which usually comes to about $125 a month for my half. A monthly public transportation pass costs $105 here in Chicago.

I would like to start saving for a house. I really like the idea of hiring people to build a house from the ground up or do a real nice rehab so that the house can look and be structured in a way that I like. I know this usually makes it more expensive, but I hope it the entire cost of things add up to $250k-$300k max.

The 2 questions I have are:

Should I prioritize saving for a house over contributing to a ROTH IRA even though I'm fairly young?

How should I keep the money I am saving?  I have a high yields savings account which has my $6k, but should I be investing the rest? I think even if I am conservative with my spending, it would take a few years to save up enough for a down payment.",finance
personalfinance,Check my financial pulse!,"Greetings,

Long time lurker, (throwaway account) have followed this subreddit for quite some time and I have gained a wealth of financial knowledge. I grew up with divorced parents that both have no financial knowledge, so learned nothing, and they are both currently broke, so there is that (very thankful for people on here). Main reason for my post is just to confirm that I am doing the right thing, where I can cut back, and/or tweak what i'm doing to get the most out of my money. 29, female, living in Nashville. 750ish credit score.

Currently single, with the following financials:

Salary: 110,000 (have been employed for almost a year) - Monthly take home around (5,900), starting in January, will be making 125,000, but will then have the opportunity to get in on my Company's 401(k) with a 4% match, should run me roughly 1,400 (planning on maxing out) a month in contributions, so take home pay will be just a bit less.

I also drive uber for about 300 additional a month, goes straight to my student loan additional payment for the month.

Student Loans:

1) Mohela (refinanced 2 of my higher interest rate loans) - currently at 20,644.82 at 4.5% interest - 401 monthly payment for five years
2) Navient - currently at 10,093.70 at 5.96% interest - monthly payment of - 134.94 
3) Navient - currently at 10,955.93 at 5.590% interest - monthly payment of - 127.72
4) Navient - currently at 10,788.73 at 5.59% interest - monthly payment of - 125.65
5) Navient - currently at 16,561.94 at 5.060% interest - monthly payment of - 188.75

Total monthly payment - 978.06 - And depending on the month, I pay an additional 250-500 (sometimes 1000 if i catch a wild hair) on the one with 5.96 interest rate.

All Navient loans are on the standard ten year repayment plan.

Between graduation and Job I had to live off a college credit card, which took me awhile to payoff, but I have in full.

Other Monthly Hard Expenses:
Rent: 900
Power: 100
Car (Lease, needed car with no downpayment available post-school, ends in a year, plan on buying a cheap once it is over and Insurance) - 400
Grocery: 100 per month
Spotify, gym, internet, phone, Misc: 500 per month
Usually give my mom around 400 per month (I know, I know, I know I shouldn't, but she is my mom and 70 years old!)

Investments:
Acorns account balance 700 dollars (I know this is taxable, but I do the basic roundups, and has literally been completely passive for me, and I enjoy seeing that account once a month)
Emergency fund in savings account = 6,000
e-trade account = 2,000, I work in somewhat of a Financial capacity and like to dabble in the stock market
Checking = keep around 700 in it
2 Credit cards, Chase sapphire and Amex Skymiles = use strictly for the points and pay off in full each month.
UBS Account (2 months ago received from a deceased Uncle who had no kids, complete surprise) - Assets include 2 conservative mutual funds, walmart stock, and coca-cola stock = totalling around 50,000 spread out some what equally between the four assets.

Using Mint = My net worth is still around (-10,000). Haven’t calculated it to the cent myself but seems accurate.

I guess my question(s) is, what else can I do? pay the debt off more aggressively? Liquidate the UBS account and pay off the student loans? I know the walmart and coke were both bought in the early 90s so I will get hammered on capital gains, but will get write offs for Student Loan interest. the account has and still is in the dividend reinvest program, but still don't think it is enough to cancel out my interest on the student loans.

I know a Roth IRA couldn’t hurt.

Thanks in advance, just sometimes need to get someone to glance at your shit, and make sure you aren't being a complete idiot, always room for improvement.

personalfinance,In Financial Ruin Due to Student Loans (Advice),"O.k. So I need help. Made a throwaway account for this due to embarrassment. Apologies in advance for the verbose summary.

I’ve reached a point where I can’t keep running. I’ve avoided my big time fed loans and I can’t do it anymore. I have to face my demons. My gf lives w me and is unaware of how bad my situation is. 

Backstory =&gt; I graduated in 2011. Basically I borrowed my way through school. I worked summers but was unable to support myself while in college. My degree was very demanding timewise, was a 5 yr bachelor program,  required traveling studios, and I was unable to work enough to pay all my bills. I operated under the false idea that I would be able to pay my loans back after graduation with a decent paying job. The recession had other things to say about me getting a decent job out of college. Worked jobs to survive, but when the loans came out of their grace period I chose to eat and not be homeless. 

Current Situation =&gt; I’ve now been working with a degree oriented job for 5 years now, but apparently my profession doesn’t pay worth a damn until your 50. I work odd jobs on the side where I can but my job requires some odd hours and commitment. I look for other jobs but my degree is fairly specialized making me fairly unappealing for other careers. I’m making $40k (w/ good health ins.) a year now and can’t afford to take a step back by jumping ships as I live in an expensive town and rent is high. I’m also currently unable to progress in my career as I am unable to get licensed as my college will not release my transcripts due to being in default. 

My loan summary is as follows: Loans in good standing: Discover - ~$8k @ 6%, Wells Fargo - ~$6.8k @ 9.8%, Iowa Student Loan - ~$14k @ 0% (went into default). Loans in default: College direct - ~$6.2k, Federal - somewhere between $50k &amp;  $65k. 

So I’m anywhere from $85k - $100k in debt making $1.6k a month salary after taxes &amp; rent. No other debts as I’ve paid off all my high interest cc debt. I do have a 3 month emergency fund. My father who is approaching the end recently offered to help me for the first time in my life. I do not know how much he is offering but it sounds like somewhere around 10-15k (but again, just a guess). 

My questions are:  1. How do I approach getting a lower buyout option for my private loans that are in good standing? How do I approach getting my fed loans out of default? Should I consult a financial advisor or a student loan lawyer? Consider consolidation? Are there any devils I can sell my soul to? Any other advice would be appreciated. 

There are regrets. Older me would have done things a lot different. Needless to say this affects me mentally all day everyday and is holding me back in life at every turn. Trying to stay positive that there is a light at the end of the tunnel.

personalfinance,Paying off car with visa debit gift cards,"Long story short my car went out, so I traded it in for a new car. I was told my credit score was 780. 

I have been using a compass secured credit card and paying it off to build credit.

Now I have $45K saved up and around $8K to $12K in cash from tips from my job and birthday money from the last 20 years. Majority of the money is birthday money. My biggest pet peeve is using money from my bank account. Obviously I’ll use it for gas to build credit or for a big purchase but I’d rather not touch it. I normally pay cash for everything. Restaurants, groceries, clothes, etc. 

I talked to the finance guy from the dealer and he said if it were him he’d just buy visa gift cards using my tips and pay off the car using that. 

So here’s the stats for the car.

Total amount owed: $11,698.80

Interest rate: 5.74%

Monthly payments $194.08

He suggested I finance the car vs buying it to build even more credit. 

Any suggestions? I have decided to start saving around $20 a day out of whatever my daily cut is. That’s an extra $6K a year in savings. 

I’m 24 and work full time (5 days a week 8hrs+), making around $25K to $30K a year (depends on my tip count but that’s the average). Obviously at some point I’d rather find a better job to make more money. This jobs less than 10 mins away from my place and zero traffic so I have been here for three years to mainly just save up. I have insurance with them and a 401K plan for the past three years.

I guess my main question is financially should I keep paying monthly for 2 years and then just pay the rest off? Or how long should I wait to just fully pay it? Any advice on saving money besides my current plan?

I'm looking for investments that can grow over the next 5-7 years, but which I can still have my money accessible (Potentially looking to start a family in that time frame :D)


My girlfriend and I bought a house last year for less than it was worth (bought from family). We currently owe $134,000 and the house was assessed at $150,000, so we have **at least** $16,000 in equity. Several fixes and improvements have been made since we bought the home, so there may be a tad bit more equity in the home.


We have 2 new car loans that are less than 2 years old. We owe $33,000 combined. Around 3.75% interest rates.

We have a home improvement loan (new windows). We owe $7,250. 11% interest rate

Mortgage (mentioned above). We owe $134,000 and have $16,000+ in equity. 4.625% interest rate (no PMI)

We have $6,000 in credit card debt, but by (Or before) March our credit cards will be paid off, and we will have $700-$1,000 a month to invest/put towards goals. 


I'm willing to make moderate risk investments, particularly if I have influence over the risk (I.e. real estate).



My specific questions (Feel free to only answer what you can :D):

1. Would it be wise to take out a Home Equity Loan or HELOC to pay off the home improvement loan? (Trading an 11% interest rate for 6% or less).
2. Would it be wise (accepting moderate risk) to use our home's equity to purchase another home to rent? I have several family members who currently rent property, so I have some resources and experience to get me started. However, every way I've calculated it, it appears that (in my area) we would only make a ""profit"" of $100-$200 a month after paying the new mortgage (assuming a $10k-$20k down payment). I don't feel like this is enough to provide a positive net cash flow due to home upkeep expenses, but I would like other opinions and/or experiences from those who have rented out property.
3. For our extra cash should we;

    A. Apply it towards our car loans and/or mortgage?

    B. Apply it towards index funds?

    C. Apply it towards high interest savings accounts or other low risk investments?



I understand that some of this is preference, snowball vs avalanche, I want to read what YOU would do in the situation.

personalfinance,Student Loan Debt Consolidation,"Hi, so when I graduated undergrad, I had about $20,000 in student debt. After graduation and a long enough spell of unemployment to use up my subsidized deferment, I broke through in my industry, signing a $54,000/1 year deal. Agents ended up taking 10% while I also ""shared"" some back ($3,000 or so) with the people who helped me in non-financial ways to achieve my goals.

​

Nonetheless, I had a decent chunk of change, more money than I'd ever seen. With that, I paid about $14,000 back of my student loans (paid off two of three), bought a car (used 2004 Prius for $3000 and then had to replace the battery for $1000).

​

Things fell apart with my gig, so I ended up working somewhere else for a greatly reduced salary, barely $800/month, but my living expenses were cheap enough where that covered it. I lived this way for about 4 years, using my savings to pay for big expenses, such as biannual round trip international flights.

​

Along the way, some friends had some financial situations where they needed some serious cash (in the thousands). Since I had a bit of a reserve, I gave them what they needed, never expecting to get it back, but it was family related, and a baby's life is worth giving up some savings. Ended up giving away nearly $10,000. Probably won't get it back. Doesn't matter, I can always earn money back in the future.

​

I had been carrying some credit card debt earlier as well, nearly $12,000, which I paid down to $6,000 with the money I had.

​

Which takes me to last year, when I started grad school with full funding for a two year master's program and an $850/month stipend (10 month/year). I can make that work with my low-expense life. But since I had $6,000 of outstanding credit card debt at 9.9%, I decided to take an unsubsidized student loan out @6.0% to pay that down, plus pay for my ""mandatory, non-tuition school fees."" Which are about $1,000 per semester.

​

Flash forward to today: I'm in my mid-thirties, have aged out of my previous industry, have $1,000 in my bank account, $850 coming in every month, about $750 in monthly expenses (low cost of living area), $600 @9.9% in credit card debt, and a remaining $12,000 @6% in student debt.

​

My question is whether it is possible to consolidate my $12,882.97 worth of debt at a lower interest rate? Or how should I best tackle the issue of becoming debt free?  I can save about $50-$100 per month and live a lifestyle that fulfills my being. (My earning is fixed until I finish my degree in 1.5 years).

personalfinance,First time buying a new car. Need Advice,"I need some advice on buying a new car. 

A little background: I just graduated college and manage to land a job right after and it pays pretty well ($65k a year), however I have a low credit score because I just started my credit. I went to a Subaru dealership and took a liking to a 2018 Subaru Impreza sports(cost $28,000 but they will probably knock down the price by $2000 because of a college grad discount).
One option they gave me was if I put $4000 down, I can lease the car for 36 months and pay about $250 a month. After the lease is up, I can buy the car used for $16000. That was the price he said with my current credit score but If I had one of my parents co-sign(which they said its fine) then it will be lower. The interest rates will be between 1-3% (Unsure at this point because I didn't go through with a credit report yet, but my mom has a max credit score so interest might be low?).

What are some questions I should ask or things I should look out for? This is my first time buying a car and I don't want to jump the gun just yet because I have a job that pays well. I have also noticed that the 2019 models of the Impreza are coming out soon and I don't mind getting the 2018 models so the price should be a bit cheaper. 

Side Note: If I do buy it after the lease, I plan on putting roughly $1000 a month to pay it off as soon as possible. I have college loans but I am putting $1000 for that also. Not struggling by any means, I just don't know if this is a good deal or if I should pursue a different route (I want a new car, not a used one so buying used is not an option).

personalfinance,"Ally Bank, missing interest.","*Gonna be eating dinner soon, but at least prepping the question and will read if there are any answers afterwards.*

Greetings viewer,

I've been using Ally since 2012 and I love it.  

Seeing big numbers get bigger every month from ""Interest Paid"" was always something to look forward to.  Until today.

I spoke to a representative and this was the conversation:

&gt; As an example, I'm looking at Daily Interest Accured, if I am making $1.50 a day, if I multiply that by 31, I should get my interest paid amount 1.50 x 31 = $46.5. So far so good?

And he stopped in the next conversation and said:

&gt; I apologize for the inconvenience, but we are not allowed to provide mathematic calculations for you.

I didn't ask him to do anything for me and if you multiply 2 x 8, you're going to get 16, and that's a fact.

Now, my problem.

I took my total amount from June, multiplied the current interest rate of ""1.78%"" and ended up with ~$4 missing from July's interest paid amount.

1) Is there anything I'm doing wrong?
2) Would it concern you if you are missing money each month?  Because now I have no idea where the ""rest"" of the money is going?

Thank you for your time.  And hopefully, it's something I'm doing wrong.",finance

personalfinance,Student Loan Help,"Hello, 
Throwaway account for privacy. I have been struggling with student loans since i finished school almost 12 years ago. I'm the guy that's always making enough to pay for what’s needed but not enough to cover all student loans. I was an ill-informed kid and made a dumb decision of going to an expensive college on loans that didn’t pay off. How i feel about 18 y/o making a big decision like that is another story but I hope to at least teach my children and those i know what i learned through my mistakes.

I currently have a mortgage a child i have joint 50/50 custody with. Because of a custody battle, i used all my money to pay my mortgage, bills and lawyer. I ended up selling my home to pay the child support i accumulated during the 1 year custody battle. My ex finally spared me and allowed me to pay back in increments. That allowed me to use the money towards another house. I paid off all my credit/medical debt but my student’s loans were delinquent yet again in my lifetime. I have 1 loan with navient now and another fed loan. I can afford to pay the navient of 254 a month but not the fed loan of 500. So that's just racking up late days. i got a (forgot the name) but it allows me to be current by adding interest/principle or something along those lines. All i know it’s bad for me but i had no choice. Now I’m 2 months behind because i can’t pay both. I want to know if there's any help for someone like me. I want to pay but can’t afford a combined 800 bucks a month. 

i did payments based on income for my fed loan and it dropped to about 330 but i still can’t afford (at least at the moment, i will get a roommate by jan) 600 a month. I'm wondering if there's a bank or program where i can consolidate it all (with my bad credit) and pay 300-400 a month. I want to be able to get credit cards again for emergencies. These loans are the only thing affecting my credit. Thanks for the help in advance.

edit: loan amounts: 
Navient - approx 11k
fed loan - approx 45k
current annual income: approx 45k",finance

Bitcoin,How might a general financial education influence the Bitcoin adaption?,"In some countries not government's bureaucrats but the so-called ""industries' representatives"" actively express their opposition to Bitcoin. One of the potential causes of that phenomena  might be a lack of general education about money and finance. Here's an example of Malawi where more that 70% of population still remains financially illiterate.

Malawi is not an homey place for Bitcoin yet. Agriculture industry - the major pillar of Malawian economy - is low-tech and highly monopolized. Malawian population is relatively small for an African country (about 16 million), with the majority of SME potential customers localized in country's two major cities - Lilongwe and Blantyre. Harsh economic conditions, unfriendly regulatory regime, rising inflation are added by inherited deficiencies of Malawian basic telecommunication infrastructure, which largely out-of-date equipment makes Internet unattainable for 93% of local population. Mobile communication remains the only viable option for local users of all ages.

Obviously, with all that growing economic and social discrepancies Malawian government has many other serious issues besides Bitcoin to worry about. Consequently, the [Reserve Bank of Malawi](https://www.rbm.mw/) (RBM) has still kept its official opinion on Bitcoin unannounced. Same goes for other governments bureaucrats, including those from [the Ministry of Finance, Economic Planning and Development](http://www.finance.gov.mw/), which, if questioned by medias representatives on the growing Bitcoin popularity in the world, usually refer them to RMB.

However, there are plenty of other people (often self-proclaimed various industries' ""representatives""), which didn't miss an opportunity to express their unsubstantiated concerns with Malawian public unawareness with ""dangers"" posed by the world's most advanced form of instant payments. This, in its turn, raises an another issue for Malawian government - that of financial literacy. Simply by educating people about basics of money and personal finance might significantly reduce an anxiety experienced by many Malawian faced by rapid and poorly understood technological advancements.

Business Notes for Malawian Bitcoin Startups Founders:

* political climate: not friendly;
* economic climate: not friendly;
* regions to focus: locally;
* industries to focus: mobile commerce, FinTech, e-jobs;
* major limitations: poor population, high administrative barriers for SME, high inflation (11%) and interest rate (at 18%), over-concentrated economy, deficit of qualified personnel, outdated infrastructure;
* stimulus: low costs, low competition, large population;
* opportunities: to find a local niche market protected from outside competitors.
* Bitcoin: not regulated (moderately negative).

Rent here is low due to a family friend living here.

Problem with rentals 2&amp;3, besides the obviously low income to value ratio, is that they’re not in my name and of the cap gains if I sell.  Also nervous of a 1031 exchange because while they’re may be a bubble house market, there isn’t inventory in the Bay Area and I feel like the values will be there long term - very good locations...some thought I’ve had to increase rents that would require capital-one would require a redo and I can pay out the other.
Rental 3 has room for a subdivide and can build a small apt unit or two on half the property. Potential $1250 per bedroom I build and may be able to get 2-3.

Rental 2 has an in-law cottage that I can legalize to increase income there by maybe $1.5k

Thoughts on where we stand and thoughts on if I should diversify the bay area rentals or build or do nothing with them beyond what I’m doing now.

personalfinance,I've been paying a student Loan that I didn't actually owe! Help!,"Hello Reddit,

I have been paying off a loan to Sallie Mae that I never actually owed. 

I'll try to add as much backstory as I can: In 2014, I was 22 and debating major life decisions at college. I had already fulfilled the requirements for my first major at college, but I was highly considering going another semester to get a second major.  

1) In my inner debate, I requested a student loan for safety. Got Accepted.

 2) Changed my mind and decided to just end my academic career. I would not need the student loan. 

3) I leave, go live a normal life. I make payments on both my federal loans and Private loans.

4) Soon Sallie Mae updates their site - they now show the date of disbursements of the loan. Regardless, not thinking anything nefarious, I continue to pay. I'm naive, stupid, and just scared of screwing up my credit. 

5) One day when paying, I stare at the dates and realize that something doesn't add up. Long behold, I call my old college, get an invoice and realize I was correct. I have been paying a loan that I never owed. There is no record of this loan ever being disbursed at my college. 

6) I'm guessing that Sallie Mae charged me for the private loan that I never actually used. I've practically paid it all off at this point. With so many loans that college requires, I guess I got lost it in all. 

Is there anything I can do to get my money back? I still have one more loan with sallie mae that I owe and I have no idea what options I should take. 

TLDR: I have been paying a student loan that is not on my Universities Invoice. The loan was never disbursed or given to me. What can I do? Can I get the money back?",finance
personalfinance,Moving home from Kenya and thinking about priorities,"I have been living in Kenya volunteering at a hospital here for the past 5 1/2 years. I will be moving back to the US in November this year and starting a new job. In a lot of ways I'm starting over and need help thinking through prioritizing financial goals. I have a great new job and a free place to live for a while when I get back. Here's a snapshot of what this will look like:

Salary: $75,000/year (my employer pays 100% of my health insurance premium and it has a $350 deductible, so that's amazing. They also contribute to a retirement plan for me. My required contribution is 7.7%)

Debt: 2 student loans totaling about $36,000 with a 2.375% interest rate. Monthly payment is around $250.

I will need to buy a car almost immediately upon arriving home, but I do have one I can use until I find something. I have a very big dog who I will need to haul around in whatever vehicle I buy, so I would \*like\* to have a crossover (Rav4 or something similar). My preference would be a used car with under 50,000 miles on it.

I also have a free place to live for a while. I don't want to overstay my welcome, but feel certain that 6-8 months would be fine. I will be living in Dallas where rent on even 1 bedroom apartments is $1100 or more per month and I do want to buy a house. Houses are appreciating in that area at a rapid rate and from what I'm reading, they don't expect that to slow down. I have excellent credit (score of about 800) and shouldn't have an issue getting a mortgage with a decent interest rate.

I'll be coming back to Dallas with $12k-16k from the sale of my car and household items here.

I have 3 priorities that I am trying to balance. I need to buy a car, save for a down payment on a house, and I would LOVE to pay off those student loans mostly because I hate having debt. So what do I prioritize with the cash I am bringing back? Since I can take advantage of a free place to live for a few months, I'll be able to shove a lot of money at either my student loans or a down payment for a house. Which is smarter to do? Do I pay cash for a car or throw that at down payment for a house? A car payment will have a higher interest rate than my student loans, so it wouldn't make sense to pay on the student loans and then take out that amount in a loan for the car.

What would you do? I'm looking for some angles I maybe haven't thought of yet just to get me looking at all my options. Would love some different perspectives.",finance

personalfinance,Reducing rent to buy first car - need advice!,"**Quick background:** Early 20s making roughly $41k/year gross and $31k/year net. Currently spending $560/month on a condo unit ***very*** near where I work. Have an emergency fund already set up. With my current condo unit, after allocating for taxes, fixed costs (rent, utilities, bills, food) and savings (I usually try to save $500/month or a bit under 20% of net), I'm left with usually around $1,200 a month for discretionary spending (around 46% of net income).

**Plan:** So I'm thinking of moving a bit further away from where I work (no longer walking distance) to reduce my rent to around $320/month. Using the money I save from paying less rent, I plan to get a new car that should cost me around $20.5k. Rough calculations show me that if I pay 20% down and get a 5 year loan, I'll be paying around $380/month. That puts it around 11% of gross so it doesn't fit in the 10% of gross rule (but my condo cost is also only around 10% so that's a lot less than what people recommend!).

**The main question here is:** am I earning enough and spending little enough on other expenses to justify spending this much on a car?

**Some other minor details to consider:**

1. Obviously there'll be other additional costs that I'll need to pay for if I get the car. Parking, insurance, repairs, registration, etc. Haven't really worked out yet how much more this would add so any insights would be helpful.
2. I spend around $50-60/month on Uber for trips that I would have used a car for if I owned a car. Highly unlikely I'll have any need for an Uber anymore when I get the car so that's another source of savings.
3. I've considered buying used but where I'm from, it's difficult to get a used car that isn't hiding some defect.
4. Interest rates may be very different from the US so don't be alarmed by the interest rates on the loan I mentioned (not sure if it'd be different) as that's the norm here.

personalfinance,Looking at refinancing my loans with Laurel Road - advice?,"Posted this on r/studentloans as well. 


Hi, I’ve been looking at refinancing my private loans with a few different options but because of my credit score (691) was marked ineligible for SoFi. My monthly payments for my private loans totals $920.00. I  have the following loans through Sallie Mae, amounting to $70,130.99:

$20,985.17 @ 10.625%

$19,864.02 @ 11.250%

$15,134.51 @ 11.750%

$14,147.29 @ 10.125%

These are variable interest rates and I have been looking to lower them. I also have some federal loans but am eligible for PSLF through my job and they are very low interest so I’m going to leave those alone.

Laurel Road estimated that my interest rate would drop to 6.62% fixed and would lower my payments by $115.00 per month.  While my monthly payments make my budget tight, I just want to be able to throw as much money as possible at these loans and make the most of my payments. My current plan is to still pay the same amount but have more go towards the principle. 

A few questions for people who have gone through this process:

-What are the downsides to refinancing?

-What are some things you wish you would have looked into before finalizing the process?",finance
personalfinance,Advice/Opinions/Etc. on my Personal Finances,"Hi Reddit,

I would like to give you some background of my current situation and then lay out all of my debt/finances for you. Any feedback is valuable to me.

* *Background and current situation:*
   * I am a 26 year old woman who graduated in 2013 with a bachelor's in engineering. I've been working with a solid company and have been promoted a few times over the last 5 years, however my current salary is quite low for my position. I made the bulk of my bad financial decisions a few years ago -- the worst of which was buying a new car in 2015 \*cringe\*. I let an ex-boyfriend drive my old car and he crashed it. At the age of 22 I very stupidly used a credit card with high interest to pay $4,000 worth of damages. I then took out personal loans to pay down credit cards. I also did some traveling when I did not actually have the means.
   * I did always maintain relatively low rent and living expenses for the urban environment I live in. I usually make my own food and generally do not overspend on things like clothes, hobbies, etc. My mistakes have been using high interest credit cards to pay for emergency situations, medical procedures, etc over the years.
   * 2018 has been a year of getting my finances in order mixed with professional growth. I sought out a raise and received it. In a few weeks, I will be moving into a new position. I plan to negotiate a pay increase as this will be a higher ranking managerial position with a new team.
* *Financial Summary*:
   * Current Salary: $68,000
   * 401K: $15,000
   * Vanguard: $2,000 (I do not make additional payments to this)
   * Bank emergency savings: $500 (began monthly payments a few months ago)
   * Credit score: 723
   * Total debt: $55,814
   * Monthly expenses in addition to debt payments:
      * Rent (includes all utilities,etc.): $790
      * Internet: $50
      * Car insurance is high, I city and have had my car broken into twice in the past year: $160
* *TABLE OF DEBT*:

|*Loan*|*Remaining Balance ($)*|*Interest Rate (%)*|*APR (%)*|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Lending Club (ugh)|8,883|11.99|16.35|
|Bank Loan|10,296|13.33|16.96|
|Car|13,027|2.5|N/A|
|Consolidated Student Loan|18,000|4|N/A|
|Credit Card - Chase Freedom|2,000|0 interest until Dec2018||

* *Plan and final thoughts:*
   * Pay off credit card before anything as I only have until December before interest begins. Any extra money I earn or receive (tax returns etc.), I apply to debt. Misuse of high interest credit cards over the years it what got me into this situation, so I am doing all that I can not to use one until I have a better hold on things.
   * Next is to contribute as much as possible to the bank loan followed by lending club.
   * I actually had a few hundred left in crypto which I just used to pay down the credit card.
   * I really regret buying the car that I did, bought it for $30,000. I take good care of it and plan to keep it for as long as possible, but it was a very, very very stupid decision. I do need a car for work, but not one this expensive. It kills me because I would have been just as happy with a beater, but I bought it during a very weird and impulsive time of my life.

I know this is a lot of info to digest, but to restate what I typed above, any feedback is valuable. Thank you much for reading.

personalfinance,"Fresh graduate, new city, new job and finances are all over the place. In need of serious advice. (DE)","Not sure how to begin one of these posts but seeing as there are many helpful people on this sub, I figured that perhaps someone would be able to guide me. 

My situation. I'm an American/German dual national currently living in Munich. I graduated from University 3 months ago, with a bachelors degree. I am now working a one year contract as an internship. Sharing an apartment with my girlfriend and splitting all shared costs 50/50. 


Currently my debts are the following:

Tuition Deferral owed to the University
20.000 Euros at somewhere around 3.7% interest monthly

Student Loan from the KFW (German Governement)
7.000 Euros with currently no interest (grace period of several months until interest kicks in I believe)

Credit Cards
7.500 USD across three American credit cards (Chase Mileageplus Explorer (6000), Chase Amazon Visa (1000), and Chase Slate (500) all at typically high interest rates.

Misc Debt
My GF paid the deposit to the apartment, approximately 3.000 Euro, which I am trying to pay back to her overtime.

My monthly income is currently 1.750 Euro gross income, approximately 1.350 net income post taxes.

I make some extra money on the side doing contract work as well, but this is not consistent. 

My monthly expenses are:

* Rent 600 euro
* Gas/Water/Electric 40
* Internet 10
* TV/Radio 10
* Mobile Phone 40
* Groceries/Food 200
* Gym 20
* Health Insurance 80

Total Consistent Expenses
1.000 Euro

Surplus Income after Expenses
350 Euro

This fluctuates month to month depending on circumstances (last month I was on a business trip for a week with all expenses paid which saved me a week of food expenses). 

I currently have less than 300 Euro in my German Bank Accounts (I have two, Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank) and am basically living paycheck to paycheck at the moment.

I have around 500 USD in my US Bank Accounts (PNC and Paypal), from which I pay the minimums off my credit cards monthly. I occasionally receive some money here from my mother as help towards this, but I cannot count on this much longer.

I also have a Hong Kong bank account with a few thousand HKD (maybe 300-500 euro worth), a Bitcoin Wallet with about 150 euro worth of BTC (depending on the day) and a Betterment Investment account with a few hundred in it as well that I was trying to build into a savings account.

Recently my bicycle was totalled when I was run into by a car, which is my transportation to work and elsewhere (to save the 150 monthly train/bus pass). I'm still shaken by this right now.

I am honestly at a loss here, everything seems so clusterfucked. I don't make nearly enough to start putting any significant amount towards paying off debts, nor starting to save money. I am also super unfamilar with  German law, and I am honestly quite disparaged whenever I see how much is taken out of my paycheck as tax every month. I don't know if I can consolidate my debt since its spread across two countries. And I feel physically drained thinking about all this, its starting to affect my mental health, my relationship and my wellbeing.

Let me know if I missed anything important. 

So again, any suggestions, advice or whatever would help me right now.",finance

I was planning on cashing the check at the bank, putting the amount necessary to bring my checking account out of overdraft into that account, and keeping the rest as cash for a thousand different errands. After running around from 730pm to 9pm to about 5 different stores which could possibly cash this check (which had all *just* closed, or ""our hours on Google are wrong, the money center closed an hour ago."") I was stuck with no cash, an overdrawn checking account, no gas, 10 miles from home, and a paper check that might as well have been printed on toilet paper. So, in a moment of frustration and desperation, I deposited then check into my checking account with my phone. I figured I would just use my debit card for right now and draw the cash I needed from the bank ATM. The deposit went fine, but my card was declined at the pump, and then again at the counter, despite the fact that I had just deposited over double the amount that my account was negative by... turns out they put a hold on some portion of the check and that even though my balance was well in the positive range now, I wont be able to access any of it until the hold passes... in 8 days... 

I pleaded with the bank for any way to either hurry that process along since it was a payroll check and certainly not going to bounce, or to even cancel the deposit and let me cash the check somewhere else. Nothing.

That was last night at about 945pm. It's now 8am the following morning, and the bank who issued the check opens at 10am. If I call the bank and ask them to, can they stop payment on that check and reissue a new one and send it out overnight or I could even pick it up in person (its 30 min away)? I realize doing so would cause the check I deposited to bounce and I'll get a nasty little NSF fee, but I'm willing to pay the $25 or whatever to have access to my money sooner than the 31st... or am I pretty much just boned here? The banker from the bank where the check was deposited said the funds would be available on the 31st after the hold; is there a chance she meant to say that they'll be available *BY* the 31st? As in, no later than and probably sooner than? Like, maybe it'll clear by later today and the funds will be available anyways? Or am I really waiting a week..

We make around 100,000 combined. Their mother cannot contribute any financial support. We did an estimated EFC for FAFSA and all they will receive based on their dads income is max fed loans per yr and possibly small work study. Is it illogical to think they may be offered some type of scholarships for academics through either state or private schools? Is that common? I guess i simply dont understand how most families can afford to help. Even if we said to the kids that they need to pay their own way the way I see it they will not be able to secure enough loans without a cosigner. Their dad cannot cosign as he has student loans of his own yet to pay off and he would not be able to afford parent plus loans.

CryptoCurrency,Will KYC end the crypto era?,"I got into crypto because it was decentralized, anonymous, almost untraceable, had use cases, and not just on the darknet. You used to be the only one responsible for the safety of your funds. It was like your real wallet, only you know what’s in there, only two parties involved in transactions (I am nostalgic and old-fashioned, yes), and you are the only one to blame if it gets stolen.

KYC is kind of killing it all. It’s not only destroying the whole concept of the crypto world, it is also the real threat of getting your personal data stolen, and you can’t control it. Recently, there were like 20 huge personal data breaches that we know of. No law will protect us, because Russians can hack everything. 

Here’s what some companies reported about these data leaks:

Reddit, 2018 - A hacker broke into a few of Reddit’s systems and managed to access some user data, including current email addresses and a 2007 database backup. 

FedEx, 2018 - stolen data included thousands of scanned documents for citizens in America and globally – with passports, driving licenses and security IDs, as well as home addresses, postal codes and phone numbers.

Equifax, 2017 – personal data of 200 mln ppl was stolen. The names, Social Security numbers, birth dates, and addresses were revealed.

[And there are way more cases.](https://www.techworld.com/security/uks-most-infamous-data-breaches-3604586/)   

I can hardly imagine Bitcoin devs (whoever they are) to ask holders to go through KYC. This is one of the reasons Bitcoin has so many use cases – it’s trustworthy.

personalfinance,"Inherited 401k, take out all money now and re-invest or small RMDs over next few decades?","My wife's mother passed away last year and left her with a 401k account with about $300k in it. The company managing the account has provided us with the option of A) taking out all the money now (which would not be subject to the 10% penalty since the money was inherited) but would be subject to regular Federal and State taxes, or B) doing the required minimum disbursements every year over the projected lifespan of my wife's life, which for this year would equal about $3k and would likely continue to be about $3k a year for several decades.

For some background, my wife and I are just over 30 years old, live in California and make a combined income of $250k but income will likely go up substantially over the next 5 years if all goes OK.

​

So what I'm trying to figure out is if we're better off taking all the money out of the 401k now because even though it will be taxed, at least the balance will from that point forward be going up as we would not be required to take out the RMDs every year of $3k. I'm worried that in 30 years or so that the RMDs will have brought this very large account of $300k down to very little and then right was we are about to retire, there won't be a lot of money in this account. We don't need an extra $3k a year over the next 30 years as we make good money now. So the idea is we take out the $300k, get taxed, and put whatever's left after taxes (lets say half $150k) and then let that grow (without taking money out of it) over the next 30 years.

​

Or if we should just leave the money where it is and take the RMDs. As the account value goes up or down with the market and with the disbursements, they will re-calculate the RMD based on what's in the account and the projected life expectancy. So conceivably, there could continue to be lots of money in the account decades from now and we'd get getting larger checks since the life expectancy would be lower. The advantage of waiting to take the money out would also be that our income should be lower when we retire, so the taxes would be lower too.

​

​EDIT: Thank you to everyone for all the input. I agree with you and will take the RMDs rather than withdraw all of the money. Per [lefsegirl](https://www.reddit.com/user/lefsegirl)'s advice, which I've been reading up about as well, I will transfer the money out of the 401k to an inherited IRA so that we have more control over how it's invested. Currently the money is in an account that is being invested for someone who was 64 years old so it will make sense to invest it with our ages in mind. Does anyone have recommendations on which company to transfer this money to (e.g. Vanguard, Fidelity, etc.) and which ""fund"" (not sure if that's the right word), or type of fund, to select? My understanding is that this subreddit has a lot of love for Vanguard. Thanks again!",finance
personalfinance,"Costs to refi a car loan, and best places to apply? [Arizona]","My mom has a 2015 Prius Three with about 38 months left on her 48 month loan and a payment of $201, payoff is about $6300. It has something stupid like a 12.5% interest rate because her credit was shot due to the recession/job loss. I've been helping her rebuild and she's doing well with it, slow but steady.

I wasn't thinking when we bought her the car and had her get the loan in just her name, instead of with me as a cosigner. Now in addition to the crappy interest rate, she has super expensive insurance - $125/month for minimum coverage. I have a newer/more expensive car than her and I pay only $95 for full coverage.

I can add her to my insurance if my name is on the title, which will drop her insurance down to $60/month for full coverage. While the cash flow isn't an issue, obviously we don't want to pay $65/month that we don't have to when it could go toward something like paying the car off faster.

I want to refi her car with both of us on the loan so I will go on title, for 36 months. Payment should stay just about the same, maybe a tiny bit less. But everyone talks about watching out for ""refi fees"" - and I can never seem to find any info about what exactly those fees are. Can anyone enlighten me?

I'd also be interested to know any banks you recommend checking out. We both have our checking accounts at Bank of America out of convenience more than anything. No relationships currently with a local credit union mainly due to being newish to this area.

PS - I know before even posting this that I will get comments about how I shouldn't cosign for a family member, etc. I'm the only family she has and we've been doing things this way for almost 20 years, it's never been an issue.

These payments are absolutely killing me. I'm upside down on the value of the car and what I owe. I have never missed a single payment and have never been late. I have been paying on this car for 2 years, the loan I believe is a 5 year loan. My credit is supposedly hovering around 600-620. I still owe 12.9K on the car.

My goal is to trade my car in for something a little newer with a lower interest rate. But I am not sure if I should (or could) refinance the vehicle. Its a 2012 with 125K miles on it. I don't really know what I should be doing. Should I trade it in and hope for the best or should I re-finance the car and wait a little longer before attempting to do that? Will refinancing the car hurt my ability to trade it in for another car? I guess I just want to know what you would do? I would appreciate any advice at this point.",finance

personalfinance,Need to pay FICA taxes back,"I came to the US as an international student in 2010. After I graduated from college, I started working in summer of 2015 under an F-1 OPT. In October of 2017 I switched to an H-1B Visa.

Between June 2015 and August 2017, I payed FICA taxes (SS and Medicare). However, in August 2017 I was told that since I was under F-1 OPT, I could've opt-out from paying those taxes. I decided to opt-out and I got back about $12,000, which at the time was very helpful.

This year I received W-2c for 2015 and 2016 so I could amend my taxes. I contacted a CPA and he found out that since I had been in the US for more than 5 years, I qualify as a resident for taxes purposes. This means I did have to pay FICA taxes during my employment.
The situation now is that I'm not sure how to go about fixing this. 

1. I already paid federal taxes of the $12,000 I got back so I'm not sure exactly how much I need to pay back to IRS. Would it be the total amount or the amount minus the federal taxes I paid on it?
2. Do I still need to amend my taxes for 2015 and 2016?
3. What do I do with my W-2c? Would I need to correct them back again?

I learned that when it comes to finances and taxes, I have to be 100% on top of it. In my case I trusted my ex employer and it turned out they did not know much more than me. In most cases, HR workers are not taxes experts so it was wrong of me to blindly opt out of the taxes. My recommendation would be to always contact a professional if you are not sure if you are eligible for FICA or not, or any other out of the ordinary financial decision.

My CPA has been helpful, however I would like to see if anyone has experienced this before and how they dealt with it. This seems like a more unique case, so I haven't gotten very specific advice. Perhaps I need to contact a CPA that specializes in foreigners in the US? Thanks in advance!",finance

personalfinance,"I want to refinance my mortgage, to get rid of my mortgage insurance. But I am not sure that my house is under the 80% threshold.","Hello everyone. 

So I bought a house late 2015. I couldn't afford to put the 20% down, so I got stuck with mortgage insurance. I was also 23 and didn't quite understand the difference between FHA and Conventional. So I went with FHA because it had a lower interest rate. The problem is that, due to the time frame that I got the FHA loan, I am stuck with the mortgage insurance payment until the end of the loan. No matter what. The only way out is refinancing. And, as many of you probably know, my total loan needs to be under 80% of the property value. In order to remove the insurance.

I'm currently paying $81 a month for mortgage insurance. And my interest rate is 3.875%. I have not paid 20% of my loan off, but my property value has risen quite a bit. So I believe I am *just* barely under the 80% debt to value. I currently owe about $115,500, so my house needs to value at or around $150,000. According to Zillow and Trulia (which I've been told is not super accurate) my house is estimated about $173,000. Realtor.com has it at $151,600. According to my home insurance my house is estimated about $151,500. Tax Assessors office, it's estimated about $138,200. The problem with these estimates is that every site seems to think I have 1.5 bathrooms. I only have 1. So that'll drop their estimate. I've checked for nearby homes for sale, but haven't found one comparable to my house.

Getting an appraisal will cost $500-700. Obviously not refundable. And  I would be out that money if it's not valued high enough to refinance out of the PMI. My other issue is that I will be increasing my interest rate to at least 4.5%. I did the math, and my payment would still be at least $45 cheaper at that rate. My goal is to get my payment as low as possible, get rid of PMI, and be on a 30yr loan. Then, I'll just continue paying my current payment. So that the extra money is going to principle instead of PMI. 

I've gone to a few banks and credit unions, but none of them have been able to get the numbers to a spot that I want. Either the rate is too high or the closing costs are too high. I found two banks that will do it without closing costs. One will only do 15yr loan (I don't want to do this because my payment will be done around close to 50% of my income). The other had a really high interest rate (about 5.4%) and only would do a 20yr loan. 

Tl;Dr: So I'm coming to you all for any suggestions on how I can refinance my house without screwing myself with a high interest rate or high closing costs. Or if I should just wait a little longer until I know with certainty that my house will appraise high enough to remove the PMI. I can give you more numbers on how my current mortgage is set up, if you need it. Thanks.",finance
solar,Colorado is on the verge of massive solar development! You can help make it happen!,"For nearly a decade, a single clause, just 17 words has prevented an avalanche (pun intended) of solar and renewable development in the state of Colorado. The Public Utility Commission of Colorado has been enforcing an unlawful (in violation of Federal Law) rule preventing the development of hundreds of Megawatts of solar and renewable generation from being developed. The agency is supposed to represent the public and act in the public interest on behalf of electric ratepayers, but has actively defended this rule which only benefits the profits of the major investor owned utilities in the state. It is shameful that it has taken this long, but at last after lots of behind the scenes effort the commission has opened a docket/proceeding focused on changing this unlawful rule.

The docket/proceeding number is **18R-0492E** and can be found in the state's public information filing system [here](https://www.dora.state.co.us/pls/efi/EFI_Search_UI.search).  Just type the docket/proceeding number into the field for ""Proceeding Number"" and click search.

​

This is a real opportunity to add hundreds of MW of solar to the energy mix in Colorado (a single developer alone has over 880MW ready to begin construction, but has been stymied by this rule for years!).

​

Public support for this rule change is important. If you are interested in seeing solar development in Colorado, or if you simply think the state should **follow the law** please submit a public comment in support of the rule change. Public comments can be submitted [here](http://www.dora.state.co.us/pls/real/CCTS_oWEB.comment_form). Make sure and reference the docket/proceeding number in provided field so your comment is filed properly. For the utility field the relevant utilities are Xcel (Public Service Company of Colorado) and Black Hills Energy.

​

Thank you to any who participate!

Edit: It has been requested that I detail how the rule is unlawful. Below is the issue as detailed by the filing made by Erin Overturf of Western Resource Advocates. (She is one of my heroes, seriously follow her twitter! @erinoverturf)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In its Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (“NOPR”) of July 25, 2018, the Commission proposes a revision to the Commission’s Electric Rules on Qualifying Facilities (“QFs”) to eliminate a potentially contradictory provision. The proposed revision would be accomplished by deleting the second sentence of Rule 3902(c) of the Commission’s Rules Regulating Electric Utilities, which currently reads, “[t]he utility is obligated to purchase capacity or energy from a qualifying facility only if the qualifying facility is awarded a contract under the [ERP] process.”

WRA does not oppose the Commission’s proposed revision. WRA believes the language proposed for deletion is arguably inconsistent with federal law. However, WRA believes further revisions to the Commission’s rules governing QFs are necessary in order to ensure Colorado’s compliance with federal law. The legal history regarding QFs, and particularly avoided costs and options to implement compliant QF acquisition procedures, are complex and deserve thorough examination. Due to this complexity, the timetable established in this rulemaking is insufficient to thoroughly address WRA’s concerns regarding Rule 3902(c). Specifically, WRA believes the following issues should be addressed in order to create a legally sound QF program:

* How, specifically, is avoided cost determined through use of a bid, auction, or combination bid-auction procedure?
* Are there specific procedures that should be utilized in any such bid or auction in order to ensure “cost neutrality” for customers?
* Should utilities be required to conduct bids or auctions at an established frequency to ensure avoided costs are based on up-to-date and reliable market information?
* Is a bid or auction procedure the only or best mechanism to determine avoided costs?
* How does a developer obtain a legally enforceable obligation from a utility?

As described in the NOPR, the Staff of the Commission has conducted workshops with stakeholders as part of the pre-rulemaking process in Proceeding No. 17M-0694E. WRA has participated extensively in this ongoing pre-rulemaking process, including attending the July 11, 2018 workshop on QFs, and intends to continue to participate inthat process and the subsequent anticipated formal rulemaking contemplated in Decision No. C17-0878 (mailed October 26, 2017). WRA anticipates these more detailed questions, identified above, regarding Colorado’s QF program will be addressed in the NOPR that will grow out of Proceeding No. 17M-0694E. WRA looks forward to further exploration of QF policy and possible additional QF rules revisions in that future, forthcoming proceeding. WRA believes this approach is preferable, rather than attempting to rush consideration of these complex issues in this expedited proceeding.

CONCLUSION

For the foregoing reasons, WRA supports the proposed changes to Rule 3902(c) and recommends the Commission clarify that further stakeholder comment and filings on QF policies will be addressed in a future NOPR evolving out of the discussions in Proceeding No. 17M-0694E.",energy

personalfinance,IRS tax W/H calculator results and multiple earners question,"Hello, I’m looking for help and guidance for this question. Here’s the deal:

1. In 2017, I earned a little more than $100k. 
2. I’m married, and my wife had a part time job with hourly wage ($15/hour or so)
3. We filed jointly, took the standard deduction, don’t have kids. I contribute 6% to 401k.
4. I claimed 2 credits on my W4. My wife claimed 0. 
5. For 2017 tax year, I didn’t know about the multiple earners worksheet, and I’m pretty sure I never completed one.
6. When we filed my taxes April 2018, we ended up getting a refund of a few hundred dollars or so.

Okay, for this year:

1. I started a new job in May, but it’s very similar salary
2. My wife just (2 weeks ago) started a full time job at $50k.
3. My withholding is still set at 2 and she claimed 0 for this new job which I thought it pretty standard.

I’ve now realized there’s a multiple earners worksheet that we need to complete. Never noticed it in W4. It was suggested to use the IRS calc I’ve mentioned in the title to help calculate the appropriate withholding given our new situation.

Here’s where I’m very confused and my questions for this post;

1. After putting in the values the calc asked for our situation, it says we both need to claim 0 and have about $800 extra withheld per month for the rest of year; otherwise we’ll end up with a tax bill of $10k or so. That’s worrying..
2. Given that, I don’t understand at all how it’s getting such a high number and telling us we both need to claim 0. Seems wrong?
3. As described in my 2017 tax situation above, I ended up getting a small refund.
   1. So, to experiment, I completed the calc without adding my wife’s wages. So, I told it my salary, federal W/H, 401k deduction, 2 credits for me, 0 for wife; and, it still said I would end up owning $3k in taxes.
   2. Again, I got a small refund with this scenario last year, so what’s the deal?

I’m not sure what to do. I don’t really care about getting a refund in April. I’d rather keep as much as possible without overpaying. 

Hopefully this was detailed enough that someone can help me understand. Otherwise, should I contact a tax pro?

personalfinance,(Ab)using government student loan with low interest,"As a college student (21, m) in the Netherlands we are fortunate to benefit from low tuition fees. In addition, all students can receive a lucrative student loan to cover expenses.

- 1000 euros / month while in college. For me, this adds up to 60-70k of student debt for a bachelor’s and master’s degree.

- Variable interest that is determined every year while the loan is being paid to the student, and set every 5 years in the pay-off period.

- Low interest that is based on the 5-year Dutch government bond interest rate. Interest has been 0% for the past few years. 

- 35 year payback plan. No fee or penalty for paying back the loan early at any point, even in its entirety.

As a student who works to cover expenses, the entirety of this loan is in fixed interest short term deposits and some high interest saving accounts. I might use the loan as a down payment on a house in the future, as the terms of this loan will certainly be better than mortgage terms.

I know the consensus is that one should not invest borrowed money, yet given the extremely favourable terms, I have been considering investing a portion of this loan in higher risk assets (index / bonds).

The tradeoff: currently, this loan comes at essentially zero risk but little reward, as interest rates on deposits and saving accounts are very low at the moment. Near zero risk is good for peace of mind, though. 

On the other hand, even if a portion was invested in more risky assets and they were to drop 50% and never recover (bad case!) this would not be a big financial burden at all, since the pay-off terms are so forgiving (consider that many students actually take out these loans without saving them, and they should manage as well). Also, I have saved up a similar amount of money by working. ‘Losing’ the entire loan money would be shit, but not give me a negative net worth. 

I know these loans were not meant for the purposes that I intend on using them for, but to be honest, I don’t really care.

btc,My Guess Is That CSW Is Simply....,"A form of LARP. Do you guys know who Q Anon is? Do you know what his purpose is? His purpose is only one thing: to distract you with breadcrumbs and get you spinning your wheels while the magician flips switches behind the curtain. Of course, these manipulative people always manage to **force you** to listen to them. 

Either by currying favor and getting moderatorship positions, or by building a personality cult by slowly feeding you what you want to hear.  Google the QAnon meme. Notice that 'Q' does the exact same thing as CSW. He feeds lies and b.s. to his base who have a near undying devotion to him (due to an emotional/ego attachment, agreeing with people has this effect many times). When there is something that basically proves he's a fraud, what happens? More bread crumbs. ""Oh that didn't mean what you think. I'll give you a hint: ... *bread crumbs*, stay tuned, there's **more**'. And the next thing you know, everyone is laughing at you because you're listening to an idiot with all your attention, and repeating their b.s. with a straight face and full conviction. Which is not to say CSW is an idiot, he's clearly intelligent. But, more importantly, he is appears to be malicious.

Therefore, BCH would be better served if they treated CSW like they treat gmax or adam Back. Anyone who lies (https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/96p5e5/csw_effect/e426dwg/), fabricates things and uses manipulation to get what they want, will never be able to contribute to an open source project based around coorperation and equality. We don't need personality cults, we don't need censorship and bullies. We need rational, reasonable discourse. That's how you beat trolls, you tear their arguments to shreds with kindness. They can't fight you if you don't give them any negative energy. Can you imagine a concern troll being able to destroy your community after you kindly refute their arguments with facts? So you stay calm, because emotion is how they distract you and get you to forget that you need only the truth on your side. Don't allow people to post speculation and pass it off as fact and you will destroy your concern trolls. I've seen concern trolls go from effective to laughed at in only 1-2 months of this. Try it.

It would be better for BCH, and the crypto community as a whole, since BCH is such a large part of it, if they focused on adoption, protocol freeze (whatever features you want that to include, either new or frozen, whatever, just develop a community roadmap, agree on it and **stick to it**), and completely ignored most of the cults of personality that have sprung up, you guys would have a better time. I admire you for being bold enough to let the concern trolls hang out, that's a good way to get familiar with their tactics. Most subs default to censorship. I posted a thread in R/xmrtrader once that indicated that Monero's market cap was lower than CMC indicates, the thread was locked within the hour, and my comments downvoted to invisible. Keep on keepin' on.

As proof, observe Exhibits A and B:

https://twitter.com/fluffypony/status/1032356771057156096

https://www.dashcentral.org/p/demote-ryan-taylor-to-an-advisory-role

Now, that proposal to fire Ryan Taylor of Dash core was written by a troll. And fluffyPony is using it to FUD dash (even though its two months old and had a wooping 90 YES to like ~900 NO). The original proposal was an aggressive form of concern trolling, i.e. the poster was *concerned that Ryan Taylor was doing a bad job and was responsible for the price decline*.

 Of course that's nonsense, no one person (unless they're whaling around) could be responsible for that. Here's the kicker though. Read fluffy's tweet thread. Notice all the pushback against him? That's what happens when you tear your concern trolls to threads with facts and analysis. Ever since the Dash community adopted rules like 100% civility, not passing speculation off as fact, not disrespecting other users by calling names etc. and started enforcing it with bans **concern trolling not only fell through the floor**, but the pushback from community members and non-community members alike has become FIERCE. 

And its NOT because we have the loudest voices. Its because we don't get angry, we don't bite back, we just tear your argument to SHIT and keep on moving. That's how you turn concern trolling to your advantage. Eventually, people start to see that your trolls are horrible people, and they push back themselves. It used to be that monero trolls of all types (concern and otherwise) would come on our sub, on youtubes and bitcoin talk, etc. and FUD US TO HELL. They would say something they KNEW was completely untrue, and get 30-50 upvotes. It was really bad. But then we slowly started implementing those changes, and this happened:

CryptoCurrency,A bitcoin-standard would be doomed to the repeat the history of toxic monetary policy.,"The gold standard was a shifty idea from the beginning. The idea is to have money in two or more places at once, through a blatant shell game.

Originally a sucker would lend their gold to a shyster and in exchange, they would be paid an interest rate, while retaining the ability to cash out their entire account whenever they choose, so it was a win-win. As long as the shysters kept enough gold on hand to settle out any fool that might want out of the scam, the ponzi could continue.

Whenever too many fools closed out their accounts at once, they'd be told to take their stupid little bank notes half way across the content where the treasure was being actually held in reserve.

Back in the horse and buggy days, traveling from Texas to St Louis or from Germany to Rome would just take too much out of your life. So people just traded the stupid little bank notes hoping the money people knew what they were doing. Little did anybody know, nobody knows what they're doing.

I am a recent graduate coming out with some student loan debt and wanted some advice on it. I have around $13k in student loans and an auto loan that is $17k @ 3.49%. I have a job and will be earning a steady income and should have enough to pay off all my debt in 2 years.

My question is, should I consider student loan consolidation? My loan break down is as follows:

$3500 @ 3.86%

$2500 @ 4.29%

$4000 @ 3.76%

$2800 @ 5.00% (still in grace period with 6 months left)

My average interest rate is not too bad. I have done some research into what interest rates I can get, but it seems like they are at least in the high 4% ranges. 

Is it unheard of to be offered a ~3.5% interest rate on student loan reconsolidation? Is it even worth it if I will be able to pay it off in 2 years?

Thanks for any help!",finance
personalfinance,Credit Reporting Craziness,"Aight PersonalFinance fam - got a good one for you.

  
**Background:**

* My wife's parents had asked her in 2002 to be a co-borrower on their home loan to be able to qualify for a refinance.
   * She was in her early 20's and obviously wanted to help her parents out
* Parents were paying on-time payments up until 2013, where they were having financial hardships on/off.
   * This resulted in a few months of late payments here and there.
* Fast forward to the beginning of 2018 they stopped making payments all together due to insufficient funds
* House is already scheduled for foreclosure end of this year

**The Situation:**

* My inlaws finally brought us in the loop of what's happening this month (August). My wife and I were like WTF
* THEN we find out that my wife is still on the title AND the mortgage
* **This mortgage has never showed up on her credit report since 2002**

**Current Proposals:**

* Re-finance
   * Since she's on the loan and title, we are investigating the option to refinance entirely, there is equity in the home so it may work out
   * Quitclaim her parents off and just have both my wife and me on the title/mortgage
   * Have her parents pursure bankrupcy because their credit is already in the tank and home is safe with us
* Loan-Modification
   * Current lender is giving the option to modify the loan to current interest rates (\~4.5) instead of the 6%
   * Add all the arrears to the end of loan
   * Need to get approved for a hardship approval which may be dangerously close to the foreclosure auction

**Questions for you guys**

* Is there a statute of limitation for when companies can report negative information? Did some light reading on the Fair Credit Reporting act and there's a 7 year statute for negative information
   * Current case won't quality for 7 year statute BUT what if the mortgage NEVER showed up on her credit report at all
* We believe we're at risk of disrupting her good credit because if the mortgage company fixes the ""glitch"" and report to  (experian, transunion, etc), anyone have any other suggestions
* Not sure who the right folks are to talk to for this? Tax Attorney, Loan Companies?

Thanks ya'll!!

-Which index funds (preferably tracker funds) are the most diversified ?

-Do I invest in one type or are there ones which cover multiple asset classes?

-Which books would you recommend to better my knowledge?

personalfinance,Money Management Help,"Hi Everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

I've read all of the content on the sidebar, but I just want to get some real world advice from some of you guys. I know that what we read and actually do aren't always the same, so I would love some help. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Background**: I'm 23 years old, work full time as an engineer and part time as a YouTuber. My parents and I are not very close, and I have not seen or heard from them in some time (this comes in later).

&amp;#x200B;

**Money**: I started at 72k for my full time job, I'm putting in about 6% + company match into my 401k, and I've got small investments in crypto and through acorns (just learning about markets myself now.) I make anywhere from 1-4k per month on YouTube as well, which is hopefully going to continue to increase and eventually become my fulltime job. My rent is about $1400 per month when utilities are added. I drive an old junker, no car payments. I live frugally for the most part, with a few splurges every now and then.

&amp;#x200B;

**My first question**: I went to college for 5 years, paid part of it out of pocket from YouTube. However, I was not paying attention at all when my mom took loans out (I know, big mistake). According to FedLoan I owe around $20k. However, I am almost certain I owe 50-80k on student loans. The issue is that I have NO idea where they are, and I have no way of contacting my mom to have her show me if there are others. I've checked my SSN on credit karma, and it's shown the only open accounts are the 20k. I*s there a way for me to determine if that is really all I owe? Or is there a risk that I have $XX,XXX in loans unknown to me?*

&amp;#x200B;

**My second question:** My interest rate after consolidating the loans is 4.375%. Is it a better financial decision to pay this off ASAP or to invest - is there is a good chance of &gt;4.375% ROI? I don't know what to do with the extra 1-3k I'm making each month from Youtube and want to make sure I'm spending it in the most mature way possible for future financial stability.

personalfinance,Getting A Loan To Build Credit,"I owe my parents a decent chunk of money from when they helped me pay for my car a while back. I have been contemplating getting a personal loan to repay them, mainly in the interest of building more of a credit history. However, in my limited research it seems like interest rates for personal loans are fairly high (6-7% from what I've seen) and I'm wondering if it is worth it to take out a loan at this high of a rate when I could just pay them back directly over a period of months. As I mentioned before, the main reason I wanted a loan in the first place was to build some sort of credit history other than my credit cards. What does everyone think?",finance

Scenario 2: Full $600 can be used to buy a car (car must be under ~~3 years~~ 5 years old ~~or 75000~~)

Scenario 3: ~~Some money must go to insurance reminder can go to car (my current boss is not sure if company covers insurance as the policy recently changed)~~

​

This car will be my responsibility if I am let go from the company. This car will be mine. I will need a car as I have been driving a company car and my personal car is no longer fit to be a daily driver for the amount of driving I will be doing. I have extremely good credit and will have no issue getting a low interest rate loan.

​

How much car can I afford for the above scenarios without having to take money out of my own pocket?

Update: The car can be no older than 5 years old. (so up to 5 year loan on a new car). Insurance is on the company for up to $200 a month. Must be 4 door.

personalfinance,Should I refinance my auto loan?,"Firstly, I would like to thank everyone in PF for helping me get my finances in check. I went from a very low 600 CS to over 750 in 12 months.

I am trying to decide if I should refinance my auto loan. I am currently with Chase and have around $9300 left at about 10.1%. I was thinking about refinancing with my credit union now that my finances are in order and my credit score is up significantly. 

Some pieces of information that may affect this decision are:

Looking to buy a home with my fiance within the next year and I am not sure if refinancing is going to hurt my credit score.

The original loan was cosigned by a family member and I want to get their name off the loan if I were to refinance (Not sure this is a possibility?) and my credit score is significantly higher than theirs is now.

Current monthly payment is $264.69 ($179.98 in principal and $84.71 in interest) and is easily affordable for me, but I want to get that interest rate much lower.

I was recently approved for a Chase Sapphire Preferred credit card (2 weeks ago) and I am not sure if refinance + this new credit card would negatively impact my credit to the point that it affects and potential mortgage loans we apply for in the future.

A YTD return of -1.66%              &lt;- so far this year

 

So if I sold it today,  the yield would be

2.58/12 * 8 =1.72%  (assuming we are 8 months into the year)

But my return YTD is -1.66 plus the expense ratio…

So I basically broke even?

 

That is the first part -  I want to make sure I got it right…

Assuming that is all correct…

In a time when interest rates will likely rise..

 

Why wouldn’t I invest in” Vanguard High Yield Tax-Exempt Adm” (VWALX )

investing,How long do you have to pay back a margin?,"I'm researching margin investing (more out of curiosity, since I'm not too experienced with investing) and I was unable to find the answer to this question:
How long do you have to pay back a margin loan? On Fidelity's [website](https://www.fidelity.com/trading/margin-loans/how-it-works), it says:
&gt;Interest charges are automatically posted to your account monthly. You determine the payback schedule and payment amount.

What I'm curious about is what this means exactly. When *do* you have to pay back your margin loan? I'm sure there's some sort of time limit (based on the institution) or people would never pay them back. What's stopping me from investing in mutual funds on margin and then holding it for 50 years? I'm sure this would beat the interest rates (Interactive Brokers is charging something like 3%, which I'm sure a mutual fund could outdo on average over the course of 50 years).",finance
gaming,Looking to buy a cod game for PC. Need advice!,"Hey guys,

I'm trying to decide what COD to buy for PC. It will either be advanced warfare, bo3, or infinite warfare. 

AW
I like it and had previously owned it on ps4 for a couple years and loved the hell out of it, though online is pretty much dead now and I'm very used to it and am a little tired of the same old. Only 65$ plus 4 bonus maps that I also had and enjoyed.

Bo3
I played it a bit but still know my ins and outs of most maps because my friends all owned it and it's what we always used for couch co ops (good old days). It is the only one here that has PC split screen for my gf and I which I love. Apparently you can even do each person gets a screen. I'm a little hesitant though because it's 80$ still and I feel like I know all the maps already.

Infinite warfare
Pretty new to this and I've played literally like an hour on a friend's Xbox one. Felt like bo3 but I'm unused to all the maps so there an element of enjoyment there. Also still 80$ but I get a ton of maps I've never played. I have also been told it's not very balanced compared to the others.

Bonus bo4
I am afraid to purchase this one because I don't know how it's gonna be yet, I don't play battle royal, I feel like it looks the same as bo3, and the maps look a little unimpressive right now.

Some other things to consider
-ill play both couch and kB+m depending on my mood
-ill like the advanced movement scheme (jetpack, sliding, drop kicks, etc)
-i am just looking to satisfy a sort of desire to play cod. Something I can enjoy mindlessly relying on simple reaction speed and not be to engulfed that I burn out
-i would like co op for my gf and I but we can always play other games if I can't find one of these with co op

Right now I'm leaning towards bo3 but am a little worried that the online will die out due to bo4. I also know the maps so well and I feel like 80$ for a base game is kinda crazy considering its age.

I am looking for opinions on these 3 games and what you think I should buy. I can be satisfied by just bots tbh so online isn't the most important but it's always fun to shoot people instead of machines.

​

I lurk on here all the time reading everyone's stories and situations and always hope for the best success! I really like the long detailed ones, which this one is going to be, you've been warned. Tldr on bottom. I figured since my friends and people around me aren't the strongest financially, or just don't want to talk about this stuff at all, I thought I'd give a post here and bounce some thoughts off of all of you guys. I get a little tangenty when I type out my thoughts so bare with me.

So a little about me, recent college grad working the 3rd shift at a job I despise, been searching for a new one ever since I got the thing. I also work a second job doing freelance video editing/motion graphics work a few times a month for some extra cash and am in the process of getting a 3rd part time job to help with student loans getting payed down faster, and remove some stress from my life, I'm weird and working 80hrs is calming for some reason. I live in a house with 7 other people, to my misery, renting a single room to save the most as possible and put it all towards my loans.

​

Here are the numbers (according to mint):

Monthly income approx average (after taxes): $2600

This is from my main full time job where I work varying times and OT so the pay fluctuates by a couple hundred sometimes, and with the freelance stuff it goes up but isn't anything consistent.

* Student loans: 80k

monthly payment: $460

Broken down Private: 32k @ 5.49% and 21k @ 5.99% Federal: 28k @ 4.15% Perkins: $1800 @ 5%

Currently the fed is on income based repayment at $0, so I'm not putting anything towards it because I can't afford it when they went into repayment before getting my FT job.

The perkins loan is a quarterly payment of $120

* Rent: $660

It's really the cheapest thing I can find around my place of work at the moment, I don't have to pay utilities or anything else just this flat rate which is hard to come by.

* Food: $250
* Gas: $200
* Climbing Gym: $60 + $10-15 additional for small gear purchases/ snackage
* Car insurance + phone: $300 - this is through my mom since they're still in her name
* Hulu/Adobe Suite: $65
* And usually about $100-200 of random purchases and stuff that doesn't really fall into a category, a really weird bad habit I'm trying to kick, but will probably stop once my work picks up because I won't have time to shop.

Approx total spending: $2100

​

Debts:

Discover It travel: $584 @ 0% still in promotional phase until October (CC score 695)

Medical: $475 but expecting about $300 to be added to it after my next visit

Other:

Emergency fund: $1000

401k match is being maxed currently at 6%

​

So I've been doing my best to not really only eat out, shooting for once or twice a month because you need that break from cooking sometimes, and cut back on the frivolous category, but at the same time mental health and stuff is an issue at times so it just sort of happens. Terrible excuse, I know but hey, ce la vie.

I know the math doesn't quite add up as in theory I should have an additional $500 on me at the end of each month, to go towards the emergency fund and other payments, but I really only started cracking down on my spending this past month. I bought a new phone 2 months ago like an idiot and let the utilization sit around 50% for a month which brought my score down some. I already have the money budgeted out for paying the CC debt and medical bills so no need to mention those.

The part time job I am in the process of getting would eliminate my gym expense as I would be working at my climbing gym and probably would help cut down on the cost of the gear and stuff to because employee discount, but double edge sword. This will potentially be at a rate of $12/hr with a max of 20hrs a week, so based off of my current paycheck from my FT job, the going taxes and things taken out is around 19%, so this'll be potentially and additional $700 a month, but for budgeting sake I like to low ball it at around $400-500.

Finally the portion of things I wanted to get input on! I'll number them to possibly help with the confusion of this long winded post.

1. How should I go about splitting the potential additional $400-500, I know emergency funds are the #1 go to answer and I want to get at least 2 months of expenses in the bank first but my loans  cause me so much financial anxiety and stress in my life, that I would very hopefully like to pay them off in 5 years just so the pressure isn't there, hoping I move up in the job world and start making more money but future is unpredictable. I know the snowball vs. avalanche is a touchy subject on here cause everyone has their opinions but I'd love to hear them! Aside from paying the min, I'm debating if I put all of it towards one loan and drop it down as fast, or do I split the extra money between the private and fed?
2. I was looking into getting a different credit card, specifically the Chase Freedom (1% on all/5% on category) or Freedom unlimited (1.5% back on all), for the cash back benefits in the categories, as the benefits for the discover were good at the start when I was building a credit as the basically give them to anyone. My credit card habit is I put everything on it to utilize the points gaining/ cash back and then pay it off at the end of the month type of deal. So is this a dumb idea to open another one for those benefits and more or less stop using the travel card aside from a small purchase so they don't close the account? And thoughts on which cards benefits are better or is there a better one out there that I don't know about?
3. Fun question not totally financial, but got any good links to affordable recipes, trying to diversify my diet, cereal and pbj aren't the best but are certainly cheap! I'm pretty open to anything!

TL:DR - Numbers are above, where should I put additional income from part time job, I know efund and cc debt first but looking at student loans specifically, should I look into getting a better credit card than I already have for cash back benefits, food recipes links are welcomed.

I have 2 credit cards with 0 balances on them but my limit with both of them is only about $1250 anyways.

I graduated with a degree in criminal justice an Im planning on going back to school to get a masters in social work and eventually become a psychotherapist. They average about 55-60k a year depending on where they are located and there is possibility to make much more if one goes into private practice. Tuition for social work programs usually aren't that expensive neither.  My credit score is at a not great 640 right now but I just payed off about 4k in loans and closed out a couple of accounts in doing so so I expect that to rise a bit here soon.

I have used (affordable mortgage calculators) and they say I can comfortably afford a house at $150k, thats pretty low but I did the calculations with my down payment hypothetically being only 5k. Should I buy a house even for kind of a low amount and rent out some rooms? I am totally ok with living in a basement and renting out the rest of a house. Should I wait? Should I definetly plan on saving more than 5k for a down payment?  

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice on how to get my credit score to 700+? My utilization is down to zero and an account with a balance of $3,800 was just recently closed but my score hasn't been updated yet. Am I stuck in this mid 600 limbo because I'm not paying on my student loans? Credit karma says my car loan interest rate at 5% is too high now since my credit has went up substantially since I first purchased the car, should I definetly try to refinance? My father cosigned on the car with me, do I need him to refinance? Should I even involve him again? His credit is damn near perfect I should add.

&amp;#x200B;

I just see myself in this current mediocre state financially and I know theres something I can do to get a leg up a little bit in the future whether that be by obtaining assets or raising my credit score. I am a guy who would move in a second if the right opportunity arises but to be totally transparent id like to stay in a state with legal pot so I don't feel like a criminal. Otherwise I'm open to all suggestion and ones that don't fit my criteria may even be helpful!

I know theres a lot in this post but I figure som financial angel/guru would come along and say ""ahh, I know just what this lad needs to do"" I figured its worth a shot to try and ask for advice, if I get one useful tool, this is all worth it.

1- Increase post tax monthly income by at least $1000 via 2nd job and passive income (ecommerce). I have a B.S. and its easier for me to find PT work and push my career in EHS forward. Spouse is degree-less (completed 30 credits) and has applied to 107 jobs just within the last 29 days. Everything from store manager to admin assistant to office cleaner; not a single interview despite 10 years of customer service experience, including some management.


2- Decrease food expenses to $500 for 2 adults + 2 dogs. Majority of current budget is take out, frequent convenience store runs, and buying ""in the mood"" groceries despite already having food at home. 
 

3- Any, and all, extra money goes to Discover payment until paid off ($10,400 balance - hasn't been used in over 1 year) 


4- 50/50 split extra cash between Ally savings account emergency fund (until $15,000) and student loans; prioritize private loan first.

Its become clear to me that governments and legacy financial institutions are trying to pull a bait and switch. First they pay lip service to cryptos using 'thought leaders' to reassure you that they're the future, saying they will be adopted, and should be 'left to grow' etc. 

At the same time they're pressuring companies like Bitmain to **prevent you from gaining crypto without ID**. Um, excuse me? Who gave you the right to demand any information from me in order to participate in an open network? Imagine if you had to give your ID, bank statements, social security and other private, personal information just to use the internet!?

Well this is even more as absurd. You can only require KYC/AML for tokens that you own. **You can only tax tokens that you own.** The Federal Reserve owns EVERY SINGLE note and keystroke in your bank account. That's **the only reason** why you have to pay taxes. Because you're paying for the service of using their notes, and its not your property it's theirs. But what they don't want you to know or be able to do, is *to use someone else's notes*. BTC/Crypto is about not having to use anyones notes if you don't want to.

So with that being said, who gave these govts the right to restrict our freedom and prevent us from acquiring these notes without draconian AML laws? Cryptos are the LEAST likely to be used by criminals because of the digital footprint. It is time we stopped being timid and realize that they are being nice to us **because they have to be**. Power concedes nothing without a demand, and BTC is that demand. They have no choice but to allow it to exist.

Their plan is to **_*EXTEND, EMBRACE AND EXTINGUISH*_**. Just like Microsoft planned to do with Linux and Open Source, and we all know how that turned out I'm typing this to you on an Open source web browser, using an open source VPN, using an open source operating system and I didn't have to pay a single red cent for it. Contrast that with Microsoft licenses for their software. THUGS AND BULLIES behave this way! Not people who have your best interest at heart. The line ""If something is free, then you're the product"" only applies when you are dealing with these corporate, fascist thugs (both of those words are correct here) like FB, Microsoft, AT&amp;T. All of whom have been revealed to be selling your privacy DOWN THE RIVER for their own gain. And now we're supposed to trust these guys to serve as some sort of gatekeeper?! No. FOSS says I don't have to listen to you. FOSS says FUCK OFF if you don't respect my rights and individuality!

 But it only turned out that way for Linux because the Open source community FOUGHT Microsoft and the oligarchic corporations at EVERY TURN. They conceded nothing. They were rightfully paranoid that the soft, sweet nothings belay a malicious and concerted effort at their destruction. KYC/AML, ETFs, etc. tthese are all legacy attempts to put the squeeze on you tighter and tighter until you're right back to where they had you before. We have to be the same way. We have to tell these people in no uncertain terms, ""NO!""  

Oh sure, it will be called Crypto by name, but it will be the same centralized garbage as we had before. The same 'king makers' empowering their corporate friends to make slaves of the general populace, paying them a pittance while doing nothing productive themselves.

I'm a single 48 year old mother with one child and have one job that makes me $48,000 a year. I just recently sold my house and made $50,000 from it. I owe $15,000 in vehicle payments, and I have a credit card I use for everything with a balance of $20,000. My interest rate on my credit card is 6% and my car note is 2.5%. 

I have a TSP with $40,000; an IRA retirement fund with $9,000. I have a college fund for my 17 yr/old son that I put away $116 a month current balance is $14,000, and he has 3 years of college payed for from my GI bill, so I only need to say for his last year of school. 

What do I do with the $50,000 I made from selling my house? Do I save the money, buy an investment home, pay off my debt, or put it in my retirement.  I plan on retiring from the Army in 10 years and getting some type of job and then completely retiring at age 62. I have good credit.

What is the best way to save this money until tax time?  My thoughts are to either open up multiple savings accounts and get sign up bonuses, or find a high interest rate savings account and dump all the cash in there.

personalfinance,"Can I (single, 30s) count paid chores from parents as earned income on my taxes to meet an income threshold?","I am a single person in my 30s. I currently work a part time job with no benefits. I will not go without good health insurance, so I have insurance through the Marketplace. When I signed up, based on a job I had just started, I estimated my income at just barely over the federal poverty level, the threshold for getting subsidies. I chose to defer getting my subsidies, so currently I am paying the full price for my monthly premiums out of pocket, with the plan that I will get the subsidy amounts back when I do my taxes for 2018.
​

Based on when my paydays fall (biweekly) and what hours i'm expecting to work every week for the rest of the year (it can change when people are out sick, on vacation, etc), it's looking like I may be less than $500 from hitting the federal poverty level for the year. This is a big deal because it's the difference between getting about $6000 back for those subsidies or getting none.
​

For reasons that aren't relevant here, I still live with my parents. If possible, they would like to help me out to make sure I meet the income level I need to. If they pay me for chores I would normally do anyway, can I count that money as earned income on my taxes? And if I can count the money as earned income, is there a limit in what they can give me? All of us want to do things that are completely legal and above board. Because of the days and hours I work, getting a second job, even a seasonal job near Christmas, probably isn't possible, and though I plan to get a full-time job next year, there are good reasons not to leave this one until next year.

**TLDR; Can I count paid chores from parents as earned income on my taxes to meet an income threshold?**

gaming,How come gaming has the most realistic beauties of all the (non-live action) mediums out there? Even back in the 80s where at least manuals show them drawn realistically and even mooks have realistic features? Hell even quite realistic movements?,"As you may remember, I wrote this a few days ago.

https://old.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/99xag9/why_is_gaming_standards_for_artistic_elements/

However there is one area I notice gaming beats all other mediums minus live action movies and TV...... That is designing dead drop GORGEOUS characters who can even pass off for real people (or at least look realistic enough for a 19th century drawing).

This was inspired after playing Dead Or Alive 5 yesterday where I was awed at how delicate and symmetrical the girls' faces are designed. However even if go back as far as the 80s, while graphical limitations restricted drawing the classic handsome Disney Prince and buxom blonde, at least the art direction and in-manual drawings show them as realistic and quite beautiful and even some games at  least attempted to make graphics as realistic as possible (with some having surprising results such as the Leisure Suite Larry games where at least some of the girls' features like eyes resemble real the delicate ones of real life chicks I know).

And just as amazing is how gaming rapidly quickly advanced in this regard. I sworn Daggerfall had portraits of princes in-game who looked so real my sister (not a gamer and definitely think its losers for guys to have anime crushes) thought some of them were just dead drop handsome. I'm not gay but my first impression was many of the royalty can easily pass for a Disney Prince and even real life aristocracy. A game from 1996 that uses pixel 3D graphics. I remember when Final Fantasy 8 was released, one of my friends had females come over to play and they were all saying how Squall would look so hot if he was a real person. Even looking today I'm just amazed how in 1999 Squall and his company have facial features so realistic that it feels they were copying real life models rather than being built from scratch.

And of course Soul Calibur 2 and Dead or Alive whom many young guys fantasized of having a the female cast in bed :P.

Hell its now even a standard to use real life people as a base when creating a face rather than making one from scratch such as Jill in REmake.

Why was gaming so advanced in this relative to other non-live action mediums like comics, anime, and Disney movies?  Even at least using realistic artwork in-manual and on the game box back when tech was still too primitive? 

I mean even strictly fantasy games today such as the new Zelda has drawn Link looking so real that I wouldn't be surprised if I saw a person in town with a similar face. And series that use a typical anime art style such as Darkstalkers at least attempted to draw their cast's in-game portraits and even sprites relatively realistic to games using similar art direction.. Compare Morrighan in the first Darkstalker (who almost resembled one girl I know irl minus the green hair) and her incarnation in Darkstalker 3 as an example.


Where as anime and other stuff stuck rigidly to traditional character models that sometimes I get sick of these other mediums because I'm fed up with seeing an anime female love interests with impossibly big boobs or super heroes suddenly having muscular bodybuilder physique just because they get new powers despite being a nerd who doesn't play sports and skinny as frail in the last issue. Or how so many Disney heroes lack scars in contrast to gaming where even aristocrats such as Siegfeld gradually gets a more worn body with the next installment's release.

Why did gaming chose to go the realistic route when showing fanservice characters? I mean as big and bouncy as Taki's knockers are, they're at least not only in realistic range but move more realistic than other mediums' fanservice girls (as in they show movements as Taki breathes). Not to mention Taki's gorgeous face since  Soul Calibur 2 is definitely real life model quality. While they're all fanservicy in general, DOA's cast at least represent real life legs since the 3rd game to a degree and the latest games even show more subtle features (such as HItomi's arms being smaller but more toned than say Kasumi, Tina being much more muscular than even Rachel, etc).

Not just that but even non-fanservice people like say your average marine in the original Halo look similar like real life commercials of some US Army recruiting I seen and the  Wolfenstein 3D even shown some very subtle physical movements such as accurate facial expression when a Nazi gets stabbed and the surprised reaction on the face of surprised agents who detected you as far as the first Splinter Cell game resembles those of actors playing as mooks in many Hollywood spy flicks.

Where as compare to how mooks express getting gunned down in anime or how Marvel comics show inaccurate depiction of how an arm looks like when throwing a boxing hook, gaming has already shown as close to possible basic movements like flinching and throwing a jab since the old 4D Boxing!

Why did gaming get so advanced in this regard? Some real life experts such as martial artists even praise how new fighting games like Virtua Fighter accurately show subtle movements when throwing a proper karate punches from how a person should breathe to how the ball of the foot should be slightly lifted, etc. Even anime that gets accurate boxing or Western cartoons made with supervision of say a professional musician get extremely basic things like how to move the lips very wrongly.

This is one area where gaming beats most mediums that don't use live actors solidly and I'm curious why gaming has traditionally making realistic faces and bodily movements as early ASAP minus games copying other mediums such as adaptations of anime or fantasy cartoony stuff like Patapon.",technology

We did not expect him to get the sign on a year in advance or that much money so I am trying to figure out the best plan of action. 1 - increase 401k or open a Roth IRA for pretax withholding to lower us back down 2- set aside money in our savings to be used if we owe money 3- change our W4s to take an additional amount of money out each month

Also I'm assuming we will have to file 2 different state taxes. State and federal taxes were taken out of the sign on so we should end up even there right?

personalfinance,Quarterly taxes: Am I reading this correctly?,"In 2017 I paid $200 in federal taxes and $0 in state/local taxes. In May 2018 I moved to a new state to begin my first full-time job. I expect to owe $1200 in federal taxes and $1125 in state/local taxes. Based on the IRS and state tax websites, if I don't file any estimated quarterly taxes this year, I will just owe a $5 penalty for federal, based on 2.66% of my 2017 income. Also since my previous state taxes were $0 (and I'm also in a different state now), I should not have any penalty for not filing quarterly state/local taxes. Therefore, I should just wait until the regular filing deadline in April and pay the small federal penalty.

Could someone please confirm that I'm interpreting these rules correctly? I want to make sure I'm not charged a large penalty for not filing quarterly.",finance

Bitcoin,"""Bitcoin is the only medium guaranteed to not be debased, no matter how much its value rises."" -- Saifedean Ammous","&gt;For most of human history, some physical object was used as the store of value. The function of value storage did not need a physical manifestation, but having one allowed for making the supply of the store of value harder to increase. Bitcoin, by not having any physical presence, and being purely digital, is able to achieve strict scarcity. No divisible and transportable physical material had ever achieved this before. Bitcoin allows humans to transport value digitally without any dependence on the physical world, which allows large transfers of sums across the world to be completed in minutes. The strict digital scarcity of the Bitcoin tokens combines the best elements of physical monetary media, without any of the physical drawbacks to moving and transporting it. **Bitcoin** might have a claim to make for being the **best technology for saving ever invented**.

personalfinance,Am I crazy for wanting to move to a higher COL area without a pay increase?,"I currently live in a fairly-low COL area (Southeastern US), however it is gentrifying extremely quickly and apartment prices are rising every year. I've lived here about two years (I'm 24) and I'd like to move closer to family/friends, experience a larger city, etc. Current financial situation:

- $52,000/year salary, 10% annual bonus (around ~$3k after tax). I started Sept 2016 at $40k, raise to $45k at my first full annual review in March 2018, and moved into a new role in June for $52k. I expect to receive a raise and my full bonus again in March. My job has coworking office space in most cities and they've responded positively to my ask to move. 1st choice is about ~24% more expensive according to online calculators. Current take home is just over $3.2k/month

- Lease ends in December, however my coworker has a spare room that I could move into for $600/month until his lease ends in June 2019 if I decide to hold off on moving right away.

- Rent $600/month, utilities ~$150 a month
- $200-$300 Groceries, $75 phone, $100-200 Pet expense (sometimes lower/higher so that's an average)

- $200/month car loan (12k at 5.99%, I know), $200/month Student loan minimum payment (~$20k all low interest rates), $1.7k CC Debt (0% interest until Aug 2019, aggressively paying off)
- $200-300 Restaurants/Bars (cutting back immensely, have been sober close to 1 month)

My current plan is to bring my emergency fund up to $1k again (vet bill cut in a bit), pay off my last bit of CC debt, then continue paying minimums on my loans while I save everything else for the eventual move. I know December isn't a typical time to move (does that help or hurt me?). I could also move in to my coworker's apt until March when I expect to receive the raise/bonus to help out, although that would add the cost and hassle of moving all my things ~20 minutes away. I will likely live with roommates to cut costs especially at first. Am I completely insane to consider this?",finance
personalfinance,Two TSPs and how to max,"Folks,

I have two TSPs,
I’m military and a federal employee.
I only recently began contributing to my military one as I went on a stateside deployment.

I did this, to compensate for the fact that I would be out of my day job and not contributing to my fed TSP for two years.

Fed TSP : about 15000
MIL: 1800
My theory is that at least I am contributing to A TSP while I’m mobilized.
Am I approaching this correctly?
Can I make up the amount I could have contributed to my FED tsp when I come off orders?

Anyone else in this situation?

personalfinance,"Question about Taxes, owing money at the end of the year, and the best way to go about doing that.","So I am going to owe something like 3500-4000$ at the end of the year because I ended up getting a really good job, and will be well over 400% of the federal poverty line. Which means that I am going to have to pay off the equivalent to my monthly subsidy for the ~8 months or so I received insurance through the ACA.  

So my plan was to have my work take out an additional ~200 a check, for 400 a month. Which should take out around 1600 or so through the end of the year. Which will take my 3500$ payment to a much more manageable ~2000. 

However, my GF said that wasn't a great idea because sometimes if you have extra money withheld, you don't end up getting all of it back. Is there any truth to that? 

I know there is the argument for saving it myself, as to not give Uncle Sam an interest free loan. And while I agree with that in principle - I think it would be much easier for me to just get it taken out of my paycheck and not even see it, than to create a separate account where I start putting the money, etc. However if having it withheld means I won't get as much as I should/proper value than I suppose I would just save it myself.

Any thoughts/ideas/advice?",finance
personalfinance,Refinancing my condo vs going with home equity loan to consolidate debts,"I'm currently making roughly $55,000/yr between two jobs (1 fulltime and 1 casual/parttime). Have roughly $27,000 in debt ($10,000 unsecured LOC @ 12% interest, remaining $15,000 Car loan @ 5% and a $2,200 credit card @ 18%). I feel like I'm only paying interest on the LOC and credit card because every payment that goes onto it, I end up having to use the available amount to pay bills so I don't NSF on anything. I was looking at either refinancing my mortgage or going with a home equity loan to consolidate my debts.

Monthly debt repayment costs:

Mortgage - $560

Car Loan - $260

LOC  - $300 ($100 of that is interest alone)

Credit card - $100-200 (depending on what cash I have available to throw at it)

I also am working towards applying for nursing school in the next three years. I'm currently doing the pre-requisite courses one at a time so I can continue to work the two jobs and not get burnt out. I was planning on waiting to refinance my home until I'm about to start the nursing degree program. But unfortunately, I'm drowning in my current situation. Along with these debts, I have gas, car insurance, cellphone, internet, strata fee, etc and I see myself in the near future having issues covering my debt payments, car insurance or strata fees, etc and see myself losing my car or home altogether and it's terrifying. I can't wait any longer and I have to do something now.

My thoughts on refinancing:  I purchased my condo in 2010 with a starting mortgage of $137,000 (purchase price of $143,500, down payment of $6,500). My amount still owing sits at around $119,500. Current market value for condos similar to mine in my neighbourhood are starting at $275,000. I just signed into a fixed term contract in February for 3.09% for three years. I would have to break the term contract to be able to refinance and that would cost around $1000. I would also have to have my home re-evaluated which is roughly $500 and I would have to hire a notary for the paperwork (this is all according to the bank I have my mortgage through). I would be starting from the beginning with my mortgage and have my amortization restart again at 30 years. I understand that my monthly mortgage payment wouldn't go up by much and my monthly debt repayments would be gone but the whole process is costly and I don't have those funds easily available.

My thoughts on home equity loan to consolidate: Bottom line, it would be a less interest rate than my LOC and CC are at now and I could stretch the repayment period over a longer period to lower the monthly payments. After some light shopping around, research, it seem that most home equity loans are offering 8.5-8.75% interest rate and I could probably have that over 10 years. It's not the best option to move my car loan to because that has an interest rate of only 5% but bundled with the LOC and CC, it would make all the monthly payments much much smaller (roughly $750/mo altogether down to about $350/mo according to some of the online loan calculators).

I'm leaning towards the home equity loan option for the short term because I want to save having to refinance my home until I get into the nursing program because 1.) I can utilize more of my home's equity at that time to help lower the amount of student loans I'll need, 2.) my fixed term contract will be up around the same time so no $1000 fee and 3.) I could use that money then to pay off whatever is left from the consolidation home equity loan. My only hesitation is that I don't feel fully comfortable going with a home equity loan because I don't know much about it and I don't want to end up in an even worse situation than I am in right now.

I wanted to know what others think would be the best option for me for right now, and perhaps give me some reassurance that home equity loans aren't all scary and bad just because I'm hearing about them everywhere.",finance
personalfinance,Should I Make Principle Payments on Mortgage (Plan On Renting Place In 5 Years),"New Homeowner who is about to make their second mortgage payment. I was looking at the first payment (Principle vs. Interest Paid) and was wondering a couple of things. Here's my plan...

I'm planning on living in the home for ~5 years and then rent it out, maybe sooner if I can find another place I want to live in and use this solely as rental income. I can currently rent my place for about $3,500/mo (let's be conservative and say $3,000/mo). If I rent out my place today I'd make net $803.36 ($3,000 rent - $2,196.64 mortgage payment). I'd have a ""free"" home and be able to pay off half of another mortgage for the house I want to live in @ around $400k value.

This is my second year making good money and I'm totally out of my league in what I should be doing. I don't have any mentors or ""successful"" people that are able to give me advice in person :(

Employment:

* W2 = $150,000
* Bonus = $50-100k
* Investments: $30k in Vanguard returning ~$400-500/mo

Student Loans

* $4,589 remaining

Mortgage:

* Interest Rate: 4.75%
* Monthly Payment: $2,196.64
* Principle: $490.64
* Interest: $1,543.63
* Escrow: $162.37

If I were to pay an extra $15,000 down on the principle every year, let's say in January...This would take me 31 months to pay off that same amount of principle at $490.64/mo. This is huge when it comes down to saving on interest payments over the life of the 30 year loan.

Am I looking at the the right way? Should I not worry about it since I'm planning on renting it? Or should I take the $15,000 I want to pay down and invest and make 3-7% interest in the stock market? Below is calculation with $15k in annual deposits with a 5% annual rate of return over 10 years

* start	$15,000
* 1 $30,750
* 2 $47,288
* 3 $64,652
* 4 $82,884
* 5 $102,029
* 6 $122,130
* 7 $143,237
* 8 $165,398
* 9 $188,668

personalfinance,I (24) paralyzed person feel like l got gipped by wheelchair distributor,"Disclaimer\*\* the websites i provide are based on what I think i should have gotten and the distributions gave me no info or manual so i don’t know where they found their wheelchair parts except that the got everything by this company, not using real names.

(summary)

I'm a C4 C5 paralyzed quadriplegic, I spent the last four years trying my hardest to adapt to this new lifestyle and every time I try to improve in some form or another Products or services that I try to buy from companies always try to screw me over. I am so fed up with it and I really want to take action I just don't know how any advice/comments would help.

(intro)

I have spent almost a year since December 2017 to acquire a manual wheelchair because I felt so lazy in a power wheelchair but sadly my insurance won't pay for it because I cannot convince them otherwise to get the one that I need. I don't know much about wheelchairs so I went through a wheelchair/medical distributor to give me more for information about what I'm looking for since I'm so out of place. The guy who help me name Luther seemed kind and went to the whole rundown about what I want, how I want it, and what I need to buy. Since I would be paying in cash I would like to know the total cost which was around $5000. Luckily I was on craigslist and I found a ultralight wheelchair like the one I wanted for about $1000 so I saved a lot of money because I ended up buying the one on craigslist. Since I saved a bunch of money on craigslist, all I had to do was buy the extra parts that I was missing to meet my standards and I would've been happy so I decided to buy the actual parts I needed through the distributor that I originally sought help for.

(delima)

I needed obliques/projectors to help assist me in pushing my wheelchair because i have no wrist/hand function, and anti-tips /with mounting kit because I don't want to accidentally flipped on my wheelchair and break my neck again (God for bid). So I went back to the distributor with my new wheelchair which is a Quickie GT ultra light wheelchair”. Luther looked at the size the wheels and supposedly he looked at the serial number which I never gave him and seemed like  he knew what he was talking about since that is his job. I paid $440 for what I was wanting and had to wait around two weeks for it to arrive. I didn't pay $110 for installation fees because it seem way too pricey for simple installation. I picked up my order and non of the parts were correct when I got home.

​

The obliques/projectors were way to small ([What I got](https://imgur.com/bc0ZeXG)) [Different angle ](https://imgur.com/MUN19H2) ([Oblique website](https://www.quickie-wheelchairs.com/replacement-parts/sunrise-medical/quickie-gt/base-frame/wheels-tires/handrims/projection))

The anti tips looks like its not for my wheelchair at all and based on the website the distributors bought it from they don’t match. ([What i got with no instructions ](https://imgur.com/hy8Q3lQ))  ([What I think should of got](https://www.quickie-wheelchairs.com/replacement-parts/sunrise-medical/quickie-gt/base-frame/anti-tips/anti-tip))

​

(encounter)

Im mad but kept my cool because people make mistakes, so I  called Luther to tell him that the parts are wrong and he SAID “take it back to the company and the girls will take care of it because I won’t be there till 4 pm and don’t want to deal with it right now. Ill have to pay re-stocking fee but we will get this fixed”.

So i go with my friend to get a refund/order the correct parts but as i barely roll in the door, both lady employees (1 is manager) already telling me that I have to pay for restocking fee which is 20%... for items i never asked for/ not for my wheelchair. They kept claiming that my order was special/custom order and that i can’t return it because of their policy but that they are doing me a favor by letting me return it if i pay the 20$% restock fee. I asked for the owner but they insisted they are not present and will call me in 2 weeks when they talk to Luther. Basically told me to leave and i can’t get a full refund/place the correct order. They acted confident that I couldn’t/wouldnt pursue it.

(recap)

Distributor got me the wrong order, won't give refund/replace order, receipt doesn’t say special/custom order, pretty generic wording and no instructions even provided

([Receipt ](https://imgur.com/Bix7vV3)) ( [lame excuse they gave me](https://imgur.com/jgtDArB))

(tl;dr}

I need help on how to pursue/approach this. I feel belittled and agitated for i was denied my purchase. To everyone else my purchase is just accessories but to me its a product to further my life the sense of independence to allow myself the will to move on my own accord without the need of electronic devices/the help of others. Its already almost september and i thought I would be able to not feel like baggage, be seen as the person i used to be but strangers like the distributors only see me as a paycheck and im sick of it.

personalfinance,"Getting scholarship retroactively, payoff student loans or invest?","Before I start, I'm from the Netherlands and our student loan system is very different here. There are three main differences from the U.S. system that are important to my situation:

 

* The loans are incredibly attractive right now, with a variable interest rate that's at 0,01% right now (no, that's not a typo). The rates are adjusted every year. It's been at 0,01% for a few years right now thanks in part to the low interest rates all across the EU. 
* The loans are designed to **not** be burdensome, there's a fixed maximum for payments (when paying it off) of 3,5% of your income (unless you want to payoff more yourself) and you don't have to make payments if your income is under the ""poverty line"" in the Netherlands. The debt is automatically remitted after 30 years. 
* In the Netherlands we have two types of loans. The first one is for poorer families, it's a loan that becomes a gift as loan as the receiver completes a degree within 10 years of starting college. The second type of loan is a fairly normal loan, with way better interest rates, as described in point 1 and 2.

I'm in the situation that I'm retroactively getting a loan, that will become a gift, if I complete any degree within 10 years (my degree takes 3 years and I'm in the second year right now). I'm retroactively getting about €5000,- and my actual loans (that won't become a gift) are about at €5000,- as well right now. So I'm really torn. I get the option of having the payment go towards my debt, or have it actually paid to me. Considering the interest for my student loans is only at 0,01% for this year, and probably the next few years, it seems a lot wiser to take the money and invest it in an Index Fund.

solar,Solar developer sPower submits public comments to the Colorado PUC in support of current NOPR regarding the development of renewable energy in the state.,"The full text document can be found in the [Colorado PUC document service](https://www.dora.state.co.us/pls/efi/EFI_Search_UI.search) under proceeding number 18R-0492E.

​

sPower Development Company, LLC (sPower), by and through its undersigned counsel, Keyes &amp; Fox, LLP, hereby files these initial comments in support of the Commission’s proposed amendment to the Commission’s Rule 3902(c), 4 CCR 723-3-3902(c).

​

I. Introduction.

​

In Decision No. C18-0601, which initiated this proceeding, the Commission proposed to strike the second sentence of Rule 3902(c), which currently states, “The utility is obligated to purchase capacity or energy from a qualifying facility only if the qualifying facility is awarded a contract under the bid or auction or combination process.” As a matter of practice, the Commission has interpreted the “bid” or “auction” in this sentence to refer to an all-source solicitation held pursuant to a utility’s electric resource plan (ERP). In sPower’s experience, the Commission has enforced Rule 3902(c) according the rule’s plain language and declined to order a utility to purchase energy and capacity from a QF unless the QF first wins an ERP’s all-source solicitation, which generally occurs every four years for each of its jurisdictional utilities. If the Commission’s  proposed revision is adopted, Rule 3902(c) will read in its entirety as follows: “A utility shall use a bid or an auction or a combination procedure to establish its avoided costs for facilities with a design capacity of greater than 100 KW.”

​

II. The Commission Should Adopt Its Proposed Amendment to Rule 3902(c) in Order to Eliminate its Facial Non-Compliance with PURPA.

​

sPower supports the Commission’s proposed rulemaking but for different reasons from those stated in Decision No. C18-0601. The Commission stated that it proposes to strike the second sentence of Rule 3902(c) “because it conflicts with Commission practice and rules, including without limitation, Rule 3615(a), which exempts projects of not more than 30 MW from the standard provisions requiring competitive bidding in the ERP Rules.” In addition to any such internal conflicts the rule may have with other Commission rules or practices, sPower supports striking the second sentence of Rule 3902(c) because it conflicts with the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 (PURPA) and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s (FERC) regulations implementing PURPA. Specifically, PURPA requires the FERC to issue rules to encourage the development of small power production facilities (known in the FERC’s regulations as QFs) by requiring utilities to purchase electric energy from such facilities. The FERC’s implementing regulations state, “Each electric utility shall purchase … any energy and capacity which is made available from a qualifying facility.” The requirement that a utility “shall purchase” any energy and capacity that a QF makes available to it is commonly known as PURPA’s “must-buy obligation.” To ensure that ratepayers are not negatively impacted by utility purchases from QFs, PURPA requires that QF purchase prices must be based on the utility’s avoided cost, which is defined as the cost that the utility would otherwise incur to generate or purchase the electric energy that the QF provides. The Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals has confirmed that as long as a QF satisfies the statutory and regulatory eligibility criteria for QF status, a QF “can force a utility to buy the energy for its ‘avoided cost.’” The second sentence of Rule 3902(c) is inconsistent with the FERC’s regulations for the simple reason that, if the QF does not win the bidding process required by the rule, the QF cannot exercise this right to force the utility to buy its energy and capacity. The plain language of Rule 3902(c) prevents a utility from purchasing energy and capacity a QF makes available to it unless both (a) the utility holds an all-source solicitation (which occurs only every four years), and (b) the QF wins the all-source solicitation. Imposing these pre-conditions is in direct contravention of 18 CFR 292.303(a), which requires that a utility purchase any energy and capacity a QF makes available to it. By the same token, if a QF is able to win the all-source solicitation and is awarded a contract, it would be selling energy and capacity to the utility by virtue of having won the solicitation and not because of its unique rights under federal law as a QF. In short, Rule 3902(c)’s requirement that QFs participate in and win a bidding process is contrary to PURPA. The FERC has twice found that a competitive bidding requirement similar to that required by Rule 3902(c) was not consistent with PURPA or the FERC’s regulations implementing PURPA. In Hydrodynamics Inc., the FERC found that “requiring a QF to win a competitive solicitation as a condition to obtaining a long-term contract imposes an unreasonable obstacle to obtaining a legally enforceable obligation particularly where … such competitive solicitations are not regularly held.” Accordingly, the FERC held that the Montana rule at issue requiring QFs larger than 10 MW to win a competitive solicitation was “therefore inconsistent with PURPA and the \[FERC’s\] regulations implementing PURPA to the extent that it offers the competitive solicitation process as the only means by which a QF greater than 10 MW can obtain long-term avoided cost rates.” Like the Montana rule at issue in Hydrodynamics, Inc., Rule 3902(c) offers the all-source solicitation process that only occurs once every four years as the only opportunity for a QF to obtain an avoided cost contract with a utility. In Windham Solar, LLC, the FERC reaffirmed its Hydrodynamics findings with respect a similar rule of the Connecticut Public Utilities Regulatory Authority’s that required QFs to participate in a request for proposal process in order to obtain a LEO. After restating its holding in Hydrodynamics, Inc., the FERC stated, “Regardless of whether a QF has participated in a request for proposal, that QF has the right to obtain a legally enforceable obligation.” By striking the second sentence of Rule 3902(c), the Commission would likewise affirm that a QF has the right to obtain a LEO and an avoided cost contract with a utility without needing to participate and win an all-source solicitation. For all of these reasons, the Commission should strike the second sentence of Rule 3902(c) because it is facially contrary to PURPA.

​

III. The Commission Must Enforce LEOs in Order to Comply with PURPA.

​

Amending Rule 3902(c) as the Commission has proposed is only the first step for the Commission to bring itself into compliance with federal law. In order to comply with PURPA and the FERC’s regulations, the Commission must actively enforce the must-buy obligation by requiring its jurisdictional utilities to enter into long-term avoided cost contracts with QFs. sPower is not aware that the Commission has ever required a utility to purchase energy and capacity from a QF larger than 100 kW. Nevertheless, sPower will rely on Commission’s representation that “that the ERP process is not the only opportunity for QFs to receive a contract or legally enforceable obligation from a utility.” sPower understands this statement to mean that a QF (including QFs up to 80 MW) will be able to obtain a legally enforceable obligation (LEO) under the Commission’s existing rules when the second sentence of Rule 3902(c) has been stricken. Accordingly, sPower expects that the Commission will begin enforcing LEOs between its jurisdictional utilities and QFs as soon as this rulemaking proceeding is complete, consistent with its obligation under federal law to implement PURPA in a manner that is consistent with the FERC’s implementing regulations. If it does not, the Commission will remain out of compliance with PURPA despite eliminating Rule 3902(c)’s current facial non-compliance.

​

IV. Conclusion.

​

In conclusion, sPower supports the Commission’s proposal to amend Rule 3902(c) by striking the second sentence of the rule. sPower appreciates the opportunity to provide these comments and looks forward to continued participation in this proceeding and the Commission’s efforts to comply with PURPA and the FERC’s regulations implementing PURPA.

* According to data released by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CTFC) on Friday, shorts in Bitcoin futures are at a record low – dropping to 1,266 contracts from 1,945 contracts almost 3-months ago. 
* Fundstrat co-founder and lead strategist Tom Lee believes the increasing correlation between Bitcoin and emerging markets suggests we could see an “explosive“ price breakout.  Lee’s analysis focuses on the MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (ticker: EEM) and suggests a rally in EEM will support a rally in Bitcoin. 
* The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CTFC) won a court order that permits the regulator to ban a crypto trading firm accused of committing fraud. The firm under question, NY-based Cabbage Tech Corp, is accused of fraud and misappropriation in connection with purchases and trading of Bitcoin (BTC) and Litecoin (LTC). 
* Texas-based Defense Distributed, a startup focused on distributing open source, downloadable 3D weapons, is appealing to the Bitcoin community for help after a federal judge blocked the release of 10 blueprints. The startup has raised USD$109k of the target USD$400k it needs for its “defense fund”.

* Cryptocurrency researcher and well-known crypto investor Willy Woo believes the current price correction in Bitcoin (2018 YTD return) will not turn out to be like 2014. In comparison to 2014, where the price pressure on Bitcoin was related to the bankruptcy of the cryptocurrency exchange Mt. Gox, there has been growing institutional investor interest in cryptocurrecny in 2018...even with the current price weakness. Interesting fact, in 2014, trading on Mt. Gox represented 90% of global volume in Bitcoin. 
* The World Bank – Common Wealth Bank of Australia blockchain-backed bond has attracted USD$110mm in funds, which has exceeded initial expectations. The transaction expects to close tomorrow, Tuesday August 28th.

personalfinance,"Making decent money as a contract employee for a state government, my small company does not offer 401k. How to prepare for retirement?","I'm a 23M in the Midwest who just graduated college. In school I was an intern for my state government. This turned into a contracted position where I'm making $37.5/hour, at about 37-40hours a week. My average checks post-tax as $2000-$2200 biweekly. I'm not used to having money and I'm not great with it, but i want to take advantage of this while I can.

As a contractor, I go thru a vendor. My vendor is a small company who I chose because their goal is to grow and get out of the contracting game, and become self standing with their own projects. The other options were staffing firms. I know my bosses on a first name basis, we have 8 employees, room to grow, and an optimistic outlook for the company. However, they're small enough that they do not offer insurance, and currently do not offer or match 401ks.

I can stay on my mother's insurance until I'm 26, but I'd really like to use this time to invest in my future and retirement.

My approximate monthly expenses are:

1k on rent

100ish for electric bill

280/mo car payment (18k loan 66 months 0apr)

130 for car insurance

100 phone bill

300 federal student loans

And 100ish for private student loan


I have approx 35k in student loans

I financed my car with 3.5k down payment at 0apr for 66 months, and my loan is approx 18k

How can I best take advantage of this additional income? My student loans are in grace so I've been able to save about 1k monthly without budgeting, and aggressively paying off cc debt. but i know I'm hemmoraghing money somewhere. How can I save for retirement, and invest money wisely? I am basically financially illiterate and have no idea where to begin.",finance
personalfinance,My home has fallen 25%+ in value but I now have the cash to pay it off - Should I?,"Does ""being a terrible investment"" factor into strategies for paying off debt? I purchased my home in 2006 for $400k and it's fallen over $100k in value. My loan has $250k and 18 years left at 3.75%. While I don't hate living here, I do feel trapped; the HOA fees keep going up, supply in the area keeps increasing, and I have no faith it will recover in value. I do think it's near the bottom now, but who knows, especially at higher interest rates.

Thanks to a super lucky windfall this year, I'm now sitting on $400k cash. I know I can put that into the market and likely make more than 3.75%, but I don't believe doing that all at once is a recommended strategy (?). Plus, you know, we're deep into a bull market run (..or are we!).

Anyone have thoughts on paying off all or some of the mortgage? At 3.75% and stagnant value, I don't see how it makes sense. But a small part of me wishes it did because that'd be easier than finding somewhere else to put the cash (which I've already sat on for 7 months), and having no/reduced mortgage is enticing. Seems hard to justify though.

Maybe I'm missing something? Any insight would be super appreciated!",finance

personalfinance,Should I pay off my auto loan? (23 YO),"**Throwaway Account for personal reasons**

Greetings r/personalfinance!

I recently purchased a new to me vehicle in February of this year. The current interest rate is 3.41% and my monthly payments are $323. Because I still live at home rent free and only pay for insurance, fuel, and occasionally groceries, I can pay off the remaining balance on my loan. Due to the low cost of living (at the moment), I have been making 4x payments on the loan ($1400 a month) as this is my first experience in any real debt. Would it be in my best interest to pay off the remaining balance (16k) or continue making the 4x monthly payments until it is paid off? My net income is around $56,000 and my total cash in hand (Emergency fund and checking) is around $17,000. Any help would be greatly appreciated.",finance
personalfinance,Is this a predatory loan?,"I will admit upfront I took this loan, I intend to pay it back and fulfill all my obligations.  However, I am in a different place right now and feel I was taken advantage of.

Long story short; last year my wife of 25 years left me and I had never been alone in my life before.  I had to figure out how to do finances, figure out how to live alone, pay a lawyer, take care of kids, and about a million other things.  There came a time a few months later when I felt uncomfortable about the money I had so decided to take out a small loan.  

An ad through Credit Karma led me to One Main and I filled out an app for the loan for $2000.  One Main called, I explained the situation and they promptly offered me $2500.  Okay, I said and went in to get the loan.  Then I noticed the 35% interest rate and figured I could get it paid off before a couple of months so it wasn't that big a deal.

Now it's a year later and I am kind of pissed.  I feel they took advantage of me to get a higher amount and push a ridiculous interest rate.  I am behind on payments, but am getting it paid slowly.  But they keep calling me several times a day about getting it caught up.  I have explained that until the lawyer gets paid off it will be erratic, but the loan will get paid, even if it does cost me more in late fees and interest.  Right now the priority is the lawyer and the divorce.

So, what kind of options might I have with dealing with these people and how can I get them to stop calling me?

Thank!",finance
personalfinance,What should a college student do with $9K?,"I have been lucky enough to net $9K from an internship this summer.

I have read the prime directive and the flow chart but was still wondering what I should do with this extra cash I have.

Can anyone point me to a source (I've been having trouble - The closest I can find is [this from the IRS ](https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/plan-sponsor/401k-plan-overview), which says ""Generally, deferred wages (elective deferrals) are not subject to federal income tax withholding at the time of deferral"")

&amp;#x200B;

Having a Roth 401k, as far as I can tell from my plan's website, my (roth) contributions and my employer's matches are all in the same account. It's broken down into three buckets: employee's contributions, employer's match, gains/losses. I think for a while I just assumed the employer's dollars would be taxed the same, but now I'm not too sure. It seems to make way more logical sense that employer's matching dollars would be taxed similar to a traditional plan. Has anyone been in this situation or point me to a source that has some explicit details on this? If I ended up leaving this employer and rolling this into an IRA, would I have to manage my contributions vs the employer's separately?

personalfinance,Federal Debt and Charge Off Confusion,"Hello all, I’m hoping this sub can help provide some clarifications for me as well as recommendations on how best to proceed. On to the backstory.

I had gotten out of the military in 2011, and elected to move my own stuff to my home – with the Army paying me the relocation expenses (as opposed to paying movers). The Army (DFAS) pays me half the expected cost up front, and reimburses me the other half when I send them the verifying documents showing I’ve completed my trip.

Unfortunately, when I got home and turned into a civilian, I failed as young human to submit the documents to receive the other half of the reimbursement – and subsequently lost the documents when I moved.

Since then, I’ve not voluntarily paid anything into the debt, and was told that I owe X amount, and that interest will accrue, and they would send my debt to collections. I chose to ignore it and accepted that I would have it on my record for 7 years.

The other day when I pulled my Free credit report, it showed some weird stuff regarding my debt. It does not show the charge off date accurately and shows what seems to me inaccurate payments made  to a private collection agency (which I’ve never knowingly made), and payments offset of taxes (which I assume is legal since I’m assuming it’s a garnishment).

Here is a breakdown of the account from email correspondence with them:

ORIG DEBT AMTS                 1,248.37

INT-PEN-ADM CHGS       .    47.08 (interest, penalties and administrative fees charged)

COLLECTIONS                    -507.96 (payments made toward debt)

DEBT WRITE OFFS            -787.49 (amount due if paid off today)

Payments received from offset of taxes
$23.00  received on 02/27/2015
$379.00 received on 03/14/2014

Payments received from private collection agency( Feddebt)
        $51.09
        $40.05
        $14.82

There are no statute of limitation for all Federal debts.  The credit bureaus may show charged off but any income you receive that is regarded federal income such as social security, retire pay and possible VA benefits could be offset and applied toward debt.   Your account was first reported to credit bureau on 04/15/2012 and last date reported on 08/19/2018. As you stated According to federal law, the beginning date is on the first day after the initial 30 day of non-payment is correct.  I hope I have answered all of your inquiries.  If you have questions please contact our office at 866-912-6488.

At this point, I’ve requested a payment for deletion of Charge Off, but they’ve simply ignored it and said:

We have reviewed your below questions and determined that your account INLMSW0MC is no longer eligible to any official payment plan. Please make voluntary payments until the debt is paid off and see below the policy governing interest and additional charges or visit: https://www.dfas.mil/debtandclaims/outofservicedebt/information.html


Interest and Additional Charges:  If you are unable to pay the debt in full within 30 days from the date of this notification, any unpaid portion of the debt will be considered delinquent.  DFAS is authorized by law to add interest, penalties, and administrative costs to your debt if it is not paid within 30 days.  The rate of interest charged is at the U.S. Treasury Tax and Loan Rate and may commence on the date your debt becomes delinquent and may continue until the debt is paid in full.  Additional penalties may be imposed at a rate of up to 6 percent a year on any unpaid portion of your debt that is delinquent for more than 90 days, commencing on the date your debt is becomes delinquent and continuing until the debt is paid in full.

So as I understand it, no matter what, I’ll need to pay the remaining 787.49 – and the charge off is stuck on my account regardless until 4/15/2019?

Was I simply just ignorant in thinking that I could’ve just said “F*ck it, I’ll take the credit hit and call it even” – (since at the time, it was money owed to me anyways, and I’m the one who messed up didn’t complete the payment process)

What about the three transactions from Feddebt stating I paid them 3 times totaling $115.96? I’ve never paid the before.

I looked at buying a used accord (2016) but the dealer said even with a credit score over 800 the interest rate would be 6.99% which I thought was insane when I could get a new car anywhere from 0.99-2.49%

And my car has a lot of ongoing issues. The big issue is the exhaust. I don’t think $1000 would keep it running for years to come, but probably just hopefully a year.",finance

investing,Lean Hog Futures - A Look at Market Fundamentals and Supply &amp; Demand Drivers (x-post from /r/thewallstreet),"#Overview

**From Barchart** 

* [Link](https://www.barchart.com/futures/quotes/HE*1/profile) 

&gt; “Hogs are generally bred twice a year in a continuous cycle designed to provide a steady flow of production. The gestation period for hogs is 3-1/2 months and the average litter size is 9 pigs. The pigs are weaned at 3-4 weeks of age. The pigs are then fed to maximize weight gain. The feed consists primarily of grains such as corn, barley, milo, oats, and wheat. Protein is added from oilseed meals. Hogs typically gain 3.1 pounds per pound of feed. The time from birth to slaughter is typically 6 months. Hogs are ready for slaughter at about 254 pounds, producing a dressed carcass weight of around 190 pounds and an average 88.6 pounds of lean meat. The lean meat consists of 21% ham, 20% loin, 14% belly, 3% spareribs, 7% Boston butt roast and blade steaks, and 10% picnic, with the remaining 25% going into jowl, lean trim, fat, miscellaneous cuts, and trimmings. Futures on lean hogs are traded at the CME Group. The futures contract is settled in cash based on the CME Lean Hog Index price, meaning that no physical delivery of hogs occurs. The CME Lean Hog Index is based on the 2-day average net price of slaughtered hogs at the average lean percentage level.”

**From TheBalance**

* [Link](https://www.thebalance.com/lean-hogs-profile-809279)

&gt; “Most hog production occurs in the Midwest. The largest hog producing states are Iowa, North Carolina, Minnesota, and Illinois. The U.S. is the world's largest pork exporter. Normally, it takes six months to raise a pig from birth to slaughter. Hogs are generally ready for market/slaughter when they reach a weight near 250 pounds.

&gt; A market hog with a live weight of 250 pounds will typically yield 88.6 pounds of lean meat (Pork Facts 2001). This lean meat consists of an average of 21 percent ham, 20.3 percent loin, 13.9 percent belly, 3 percent spareribs, 7.3 percent Boston butt roast and blade steaks, and 10.3 percent picnic. The rest goes into jowl, lean trim, fat and miscellaneous cuts and trimmings (USDA-AMS).
Pork bellies, which used to trade on the CME, are mainly used for bacon and can be frozen and stored for up to a year prior to processing. The contract was discontinued due to a lack of liquidity. Tips on Trading Lean Hog Futures: Seasonality tends to lead hog prices higher between May and July the heart of grilling season in the United States.

&gt; The price of corn has a strong correlation with lean hog futures because hogs eat corn. If the price of corn rises substantially, farmers tend to take their hogs to market at lower weights (younger) to avoid high feed costs. At these times, lean hog futures prices tend to drop due to increased supplies.
One can estimate the future amount of hog production by monitoring the Hogs and Pigs Report. When the number of newborn pigs is lower than in previous quarters, it is likely that hog production will be lower in six months later when they are ready for market.”

**The Lean Hog (cash) Index or LHI**

As stated above, the Lean Hog futures contract is financially settled and uses the CME's 2 day weighted average cash index to determine the final price.  The details of the index can be found [here](http://www.cmegroup.com/rulebook/CME/II/150/152/152.pdf).  

Note that the cash index is related to the cash that is paid for *live hogs* and not for the finished pork product.

The data the index uses are released in report [""LM_HG201""](https://www.ams.usda.gov/mnreports/lm_hg201.txt) which details prior day production for US hogs.  This report is issued every weekday morning around 10am central and allows you to calculate the CME index before they publish it since they typically lag 2 days in their reporting.  [Calculation](https://imgur.com/a/MSEIULB). Note that the report isn’t released at any specific time as I’ve seen it range from 10:30am to 11:30am (and sometimes not until after the market closes on the days where the contract settles due to “packer submission issues”….)

[Cash Index since 2016](https://imgur.com/a/B7yVRIG)

For a quick overview, these cash prices are what packing plants (e.g. Tyson) are paying to Hog producers for their livestock. Another important data point is the cutout value which indicates what packers are able to sell their products for.  We can determine their margins based on the values they're paying for hogs and the values they can sell the end product for.  From here we can get a glimpse at future action depending on a few other variables most notably demand (consumer spending, international trade relationships, global demand for protein, seasonality etc.)

- [Cutout AM](https://www.ams.usda.gov/mnreports/lm_pk600.txt) released around 11am central

- [Cutout PM](https://www.ams.usda.gov/mnreports/lm_pk602.txt) released around 3pm central and these are the final daily prices.

- [Hog Daily Summary](https://www.ams.usda.gov/mnreports/lsddhps.pdf) released shortly after the PM report

- [Here’s a link that provides a bit more detail on the various reports &amp; pricing methodologies](https://www.nationalhogfarmer.com/marketpreview/undertstanding-usda-hot-price-reports-1214)

The important thing to note is that the future price and cash index will converge at the end of every contract's life.  This isn't always the case in physically delivered contracts but it is in the financially settled ones. It is worth noting that it won’t be an exact convergence but rather an educated estimate so there is some arbitrage opportunity here but the market is fairly efficient so it’s very hard to get an edge.

#October Contract

[Here is what the October contract looks like today](https://imgur.com/a/41h1JQW)

Currently there's a $2.85 positive spread between the futures price of $51.78 (8.24.18) and the latest CME index of $48.93 (8.23.18). The October contract began its descent on June 28th when the quarterly Hogs and Pigs report was released [(Link)]( http://usda.mannlib.cornell.edu/usda/current/HogsPigs/HogsPigs-06-28-2018.pdf). This report showed that the total hog inventory was up 3%, which was the highest June 1st inventory measured since it was first measured starting back in 1964. The breeding inventory was up 3% YoY, the marketing inventory was up 3% YoY, and the March-May 2018 pig crop was up 4% YoY.  The report showed that hog production from mid-July through November would be, on average, 3.7% higher YoY which was higher than the trade had been expecting. It also showed that the breeding herd increased by 3.5% YoY which is much higher than the trade’s estimate at +1.7% YoY. Long story short, this report showed that production in the second half of 2018 would be record large and that the growth of the herd was still strong and not expected to slow in the near term. 

What has happened since then is that packers have broken the cash (I’m referencing the LHI) down from a June 22nd peak of $86.20 to the latest index price of $48.93 on August 23rd ([Link to the August contract shows how much of a break in pricing this was]( https://imgur.com/a/THzfTpD) ). The break in the cash was intensified by producers pulling forward inventory to take advantage of higher cash pricing in Q3 than what they feared they would have to take in Q4 which could be seen with the implied pricing given by the December contract ( [Shown Here]( https://imgur.com/a/JKPAcOO) ).

The week of August 15th brought a significant rally in futures pricing due to a combination of a potential NAFTA breakthrough and initial ASF (African Swine Flu, which I’ll get into later) which was largely driven by short covering. These gains in the October contract have mostly been given back as NAFTA did not come along as quickly as hoped, cash pricing continued to decline and reality set back in. 

**[Current futures curve of the hog market]( https://imgur.com/a/f5XZRvA)**

#2019 and Potential Supply Disruptions 

As mentioned above, domestic pork production in the United States will remain at high levels until the herd begins to experience a contraction. Going off the assumption that any contraction will not be likely to occur until at least 2019, one can infer that prices will very likely remain at depressed levels for the near term. However, there are a couple factors that could begin to change up the S&amp;D picture for 2019.

**1)**	Trade resolutions that increase demand for exports

Earlier this year, Mexico put into a place a series of tariffs that were designed as a way of striking back against the United States for its steel &amp; aluminum tariffs. Since Mexico is the largest single international buyer of pork, there were specific tariffs placed upon pork (only the most popular cuts) and it’s very important to note that there was a 350K ton allowance before these duties are implemented. The result of these tariffs was enough to drive the cutout pricing lower which actually increased demand for pork outside of Mexico as shown on the chart below:

[Weekly pork export sales per Allendale](https://imgur.com/a/FHRyooR)

It’s difficult to determine how much of an effect a NAFTA resolution could actually have on cash prices and may end up being more psychological than anything. It could however drive buyers back to the market with the assumption being that they would want to start purchasing cheap product while they can.

**2)**	Diseases that shrink the supply

Earlier this month, African Swine Fever (ASF) was discovered in China for the first time and since then there have been a total of 4 outbreaks spread across a wide geographical distance.
 [This article from “Sciencemag” does a great job in describing the virus and some of the implications.]( http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/08/can-china-world-s-biggest-pork-producer-contain-fatal-pig-virus-scientists-fear-worst)

[USDA special report on African Swine Fever in China]( https://gain.fas.usda.gov/Recent%20GAIN%20Publications/Expansion%20of%20African%20Swine%20Fever%20Outbreak%20in%20China_Beijing_China%20-%20Peoples%20Republic%20of_8-17-2018.pdf)

[WSJ on ASF in China]( https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinas-swine-fever-outbreak-spreads-1535034211)

[Bloomberg – “ASF could impact US-China trade talks”]( https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-08-24/chinese-pig-disease-could-impact-trade-talks-analyst-says)

&gt; It isn’t possible to predict with any certainty how the disease will spread -— there could be sporadic outbreaks with an insignificant national effect. But the density of hogs and the scale at which they are raised in China creates a serious risk, Stuart said. A widespread outbreak could lead to mass culling of hogs, and since imports represent about 3 percent of China’s pork consumption, even a 10 percent cull would have significant impacts on import needs.

&gt; ""It’s not like they need the U.S.,"" Stuart says, noting that the European Union is a bigger exporter, supplying about 55 percent of the Chinese market, so the potential impact from the disease on trade talks wouldn’t be immediate. ""But when you look at potential, it could get to a scenario where they consider lifting the duties.""

The best case scenario for China is that the disease doesn’t spread beyond these current outbreaks and the losses remain relatively minimal. The worst case is the Chinese can’t contain the virus and it begins to spread in such a way that they are forced to cull massive numbers of hogs. Should this happen, its possible China will have to turn to foreign importers to replace the lost supply which could be the EU given their already sizable export program and China’s current trade issues with the US.
However, it’s probably worth mentioning that Romania just had a large outbreak of ASF ( [Reuters Link]( https://www.reuters.com/article/us-romania-swineflu-pigs/african-swine-fever-hits-romanias-biggest-pig-farm-idUSKCN1LA0LR?il=0) ) within their largest pig breeding farm that will result in the culling of 140K animals. It seems as though there were outbreaks on smaller farms in the region and those farmers ended up tossing the dead carcasses in the Danube River which this larger commercial farm uses for drinking water. 

By itself, the outbreak in Romania is probably not an issue worth concern but it’s worth keeping an eye on in case this spreads to somewhere like Germany which rivals the US in terms of export value (both export 15% of the global value). This would be the worst case scenario and probably unlikely due to the health &amp; animal welfare standards in Western Europe (example: Denmark is actually building a fence to keep wild boars out of its borders).
Overall, it’s worth keeping an eye on but it will be a non-issue if they contain it.

personalfinance,Parents f*ed me over,"So my wife and I are buying our first house and getting the ball rolling on the mortgage. We have 3% (~ 14k) saved plus closing costs ( I know we should wait for 20% but our student loans and current finances make that way to long of a road)

In the initial stages of the process all parties discover that my deceased grandmother’s house is in my name. My parents did this when she passed and I was in high school to help with the local taxes and they told me about it, but being a dumb teenager, I completely forgot about it.

Now the mortgage underwriters want 5% instead of 3 since this is no longer a first time home purchase. My wife is ready to rip my parents heads off but I feel like it was an honest mistake and everyone just forgot about this detail along the way.

Should I be more upset about this? The house was paid off long ago and my parents have been renting it to family friends for next to nothing for a while, enough to pay all the taxes with a little left over. 

I’m planning on taking out an equity loan to cover the missing cost (house is worth about 100k) but I wanted to throw this out there to get opinions if that is a bad idea or not.

personalfinance,Navigating using student loans toward credit debt,"Recently started graduate school full-time. I am not allowed to work during my first year (law school) and so my loans are supporting me for now.

I was stupid as a younger adult and ran credit cards up (balances amount to about 5.5k on traditional cards and 1k on an interest-free healthcare card) and now as a still-pretty-young adult am working to fix it. I also have a federal student loan ($2.7k) from my undergrad, but payment is deferred during graduate school. My loans are sufficient to cover the minimum payments needed for my credit card monthly payments. 

My issue: My mom gifted me the money to pay for a laptop. My law school offers a loan adjustment that reimburses for computer costs up to $2,000. It is simply an add-on to my GradPLUS loan, not a separate loan.

I'm wondering if, even though I do not technically need the computer loan as I'm budgeted fine, should I take the loan and use it to make extra payments toward my higher-interest credit cards? Will this have a positive effect on my credit score? Is it worth it? 

My intuition says that using the low-interest loan to pay off the much higher-interest cards is a good idea, but am not sure about if accruing the extra debt will negatively impact my score. I'm not sure if I have some misunderstanding of how the system works. I also feel like it is somehow not ethical?? I don't know why.

CryptoCurrency,"FYI Just in Case You Didn't Know, Ripple is NOT a cryptocurrency and it is VERY Centralized","I'm frustrated that there are so many scams in this space relying on people's inability to discern the truth for themselves. We've got people in this sub claiming **that ripple is more decentralized than BTC**. Either they're shills or they are grossly uninformed. This is my attempt to get the dialog started and to let you know that yes, Ripple is not a crypto like BTC/POW chains and yes, it is centralized to hell!

https://news.bitcoin.com/centralized-ripple-is-probably-a-security-token/

&gt;#How Centralized Must a Cryptocurrency Be Before It Becomes a Security?

&gt;**Apr 5, 2018**  (**EDIT** Yeah old FUD right?)

&gt;Ripple has long been criticized for its centralization. These concerns have revolved around the degree to which Ripple, or its partner exchanges – aka Ripple Gateways – have the power to freeze and reverse transactions. Ripple’s greatest centralization problem may owe less to the way its nodes operate, however, and more to the amount of coins held by the company. Given that Ripple owns the majority of all XRP, the argument goes, anyone buying the coin is essentially buying shares in the company.

&gt;Ripple may not qualify because Coinbase decrees it essential that **“the ownership stake retained by the team is a minority stake””**. This week, it emerged that Ripple had tried to buy its way onto Coinbase and GDAX, **only for its $1 million sweetener to be rebuffed by the U.S. exchanges.** There’s a certain irony in a centralized exchange not wanting to accept a coin **because it’s too centralized.**

&gt;Over the last couple of days, several commenters have crafted scathing critiques of ripple, averring that the cryptocurrency is swimming in security seas. **“XRP is a security. Ripple Co is the issuer.** Brad Garlinghouse, Chris Larsen, and other Ripple Co executives are subject to the anti-fraud laws under SEC jurisdiction,” opined Lawson Baker, adding “**A supposed decentralized cryptocurrency can be a security with enough centralization.**” Baker also claims to have assessed ripple using Coinbase’s own listing criteria, **and found that there’s a 50% chance of the token being categorized as a security.**

&gt;#Lawson Baker continues: “XRP is definitely not decentralized. 

&gt;#Ripple Co creates the common enterprise. 

&gt;#Ripple Co initially distributed all of XRP for money. 
&gt;**This is the “investment of money” element of Howey Test. Ripple Co and founders control more than ~60% of the XRP in existence.** Control is general **10% of voting power in traditional finance.** Ripple Co **even controls the inflation / dilution rate of XRP**”. He finishes: “Security analysis is a spectrum. **XRP is the blinding security white light.**’”

https://news.bitcoin.com/new-research-suggests-ripple-is-even-more-centralized-than-previously-thought/

&gt;Despite being associated with cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and ethereum, ripple’s status as a decentralized currency is a matter of dispute. Critics have taken aim at XRP for years, claiming that Ripple exerts an unprecedented degree of control over transactions, something the company has always denied. **A new report from Bitmex Research, whose cryptocurrency analysis carries great weight, suggests that ripple may be even more centralized than previously thought.**

&gt;In 2015, Ripple took advantage of the Ripple freeze feature instituted in August 2014. The Bitstamp gateway froze funds belonging to a family member of Jed McCaleb. Some consider this ironic: Ripple originally stated that the freeze feature was implemented to enable gateways to comply with orders from law enforcement **yet the first actual usage of the feature appears to have been an order to comply with an instruction from the Ripple company itself**, against one of the founders.

&gt;**This information was already in the public domain thanks to to court documents**, as was the news that **the first 32,000 block headers from the Ripple ledger are missing**, making it impossible **to fully audit the company all the way back to when 100 billion XRP were created.** 2013 is a long time ago in cryptocurrency history, and a lot has happened since then, both to Ripple and to the industry in general. Bitmex does a meticulous job of tracking the ups, downs and labyrinthine goings on at Ripple HQ – or Ripple Labs as the company was known at one stage in its history.",cryptocurrency

## Tens of billions of P2P funds enter cryptocurrency world with the hope of filling “capital holes” with speculation​

The P2P industry is currently experiencing the biggest shake-up in a long while, with a large number of platforms being removed or going out of business.

Following this shake-up, platforms, funds, practitioners, and investors have unexpectedly started migrating to the world of cryptocurrency.

Several quantitative investment teams on the market have expressed that they have received inquiries from P2P platforms. These platforms state that their funds number in the billions or even tens of billions, and ask whether or not it is possible to use these funds to speculate and double their value in around 3 months.

“The capital chain for a lot of these platforms are breaking down, so they want to use the cryptocurrency market to earn money and fill in the holes.” states Bing Qian, head of a quantitative investment team.

A dangerous game of desperation is currently being played.

​

01 A Dangerous Game

“I’ll give you $6 billion; you should use it to speculate on crypto’s secondary market.“ A month ago, Mr. Qian met a mysterious person in this manner.

They immediately wanted to give $6 billion to invest, but the most Mr. Qian had ever handled was $1 billion.

The thought of such massive amounts of money figuratively falling from the sky made Mr. Qian very excited.

​

He even started about the possibility of using $6 billion to initiate a “Soros attack” within the cryptocurrency market.

In the end, he made his plan: invest long in the futures market and raise the price of the coins, then short the futures market and pressure the price downward.

“$6 billion is enough to manipulate the price of Bitcoin.” Mr. Qian spend the night checking over and over again that this feat was indeed possible.

It was a classic play from the stock market playbook, but the biggest risk was whether or not another investor had even more funds to use and could enter into a game with him.

​

“If my opponent has more funds than me, the risk will be high, but if there is a large amount of orders, then it would be possible to increase the rate at which I’m making money.” states Mr. Qian. If his plan really succeeded, he though it would be spectacular and become a classic in the history of digital currency.

​

“Doubling $6 billion in half a year, I don’t think it’s hard.” After repeated calculations, Mr. Qian found that the possibility of ending in the red was low.

However, the mysterious person wasn’t ready to give Bing Qian that much time, giving him time limits such as only “three months” or “as soon as possible”.

​

Bing qian started to get suspicious and started questioning the source of the mysterious person’s funds, “I felt that they were very anxious, not like other big investors, who have a mentality of slowly but easily making money.”

After countless questions, the mysterious person finally admitted that they actually come from a P2P platform that ended up having billions of dollars worth of liabilities. “At most it can last another three months, after which it will implode if the liabilities and vulnerabilities at not addressed.”

​

In other words, they were prepared to use investors’ money to make a final “life or death” gamble.

“If the platform went under while I was handling the funds, then I might get implicated when the authorities step in and trace the whereabouts of the funds.” Mr. Qian tried to think of ways to mitigate the risk, but in the end every move would have been risky.

After hesitating for two weeks, he suddenly saw the platform appear on the news.

It had already imploded, and investors were collectively protecting their rights.

Mr. Qian was happy he didn’t accept the ticking time bomb, but then he realized, a shockingly large amount of P2P funds were entering the cryptocurrency market.

And brave teams had already accepted the funds.

“There are some worth millions and some worth billions; none of the sums are small.” Mr. Qian states. He has a peer that has already accepted a $500 million deal, and within 4 months has realized a 70% income.

The business has essentially given him financial freedom.

In the words of Mr. Qian, this is called “The deal of a lifetime”.

During such a violent shake-up of the P2P industry, a large number of platforms are trying to make money in this way. If they make money, then the platform continues operating; if they lose money, then they run away via bankruptcy.

According to the founders of several quantitative investment teams, the amount of P2P funds entering the cryptocurrency market is estimated to be in the tens of billions.

Mr. Qian reasons, “This could be the reason for the relatively large price swings in the market recently.

While a final stand might sound brave, it is actually just playing a very dangerous game.

Investors’ money being put into such a high-risk scenario, is P2P’s final gambit.

​

​

02 Steering Migration

Besides P2P platforms proactively moving money into the cryptocurrency market, a large amount of retail investors have also started to shift their battleground.

Most platforms that have gone under recently have been high-risk, high-interest rate platforms.

That is, users who are willing to use the platform tend to be less averse to risk.And this group of people naturally fits with speculators.

After these platforms collapse, investors start looking for new targets.

Cryptocurrency is currently marked as their next destination.

Ye He, an investor, recently earned millions of dollars through P2P lending and has been transferring it into cryptocurrency speculation.

“I allocate Bitcoin and Ethereum on a 7:3 scale” Mr. He states. Shortly after buying, Mr. He was pleasantly met with a surge in price.

He also states, “The speed and return is much higher than that of P2P”

According to P2Peye’s data, net outflow from the industry was valued at CNY￥11.27 billion.

​

Using East Silver Valley and MinDai TianXia as examples, from the time East Silver Valley came online until now, the net outflow of capital has been unmanageable, with a net outflow of $1.6 billion in March.

While MinDai TianXia does not have a net outflow, the net inflow between May and June has dropped off a cliff, severely decreasing.

In a survey done by data firms, 30% of investors said they would continue to invest in online lending, but only after regulation has been improved.

Another 20% said they no longer planned to invest in online lending, but instead switch to digital currencies.

Using this ratio, then in June there will be at least $2.2 billion in net inflows to the cryptocurrency market.

In addition, practitioners have been fleeing the online lending industry, leading to a massive transformation in demographics.

“Before, my friends were doing P2P, but now if they aren’t doing blockchain, then they are speculating coin prices.” an anonymous online lending businessman confesses; before you could see a lot online lending news within your circle of friends, but now when you look, it is mostly blockchain news.

“Since the beginning of the year, there have been constant calls from companies dealing with blockchain or cryptocurrency inviting me to interview.” an anonymous operational staff member of an online financial platform is quoted as saying.

​

The operations and market personnel in the online lending industry are highly sought after in the blockchain industry.

“The industries both have elements of wealth management, and have a lot of commonalities from the perspective of operations and market promotions, so we are poaching people from the online lending industry.” an anonymous HR personnel at a blockchain company states. They have already poached several senior executives.

The online lending industry is currently becoming the biggest reserve of human talent available to the blockchain industry.

“The recent wave of departures if very noticeable, with nearly 30% of online lending practitioners joining the cryptocurrency sector.“ says Lisa, a headhunter who specializes in online finance.

On the other hand, many P2P companies that have left the scene have also made great efforts to enter the digital currency field.

“A lot of P2P companies are created by real estate groups from Wenzhou or local rich owners. After they leave the P2P sector, they start to invest in or speculate on coin prices” says an anonymous P2P platform founder.

It is evident that many practitioners, platforms, and funds have started to collectively shift from P2P to cryptocurrency.

​

​

03 Where is the Road?

All money flows towards the highest possible yield.

There is currently a migration of money from P2P to cryptocurrency.

And the whole industry is starting to suffer from a shortage of assets.

A-Shares are trending downward, Hong Kong stocks are weak, and bank earnings are low, so many investors feel that their investment channels are very limited.

If the trade war between China and the US becomes more intense, then everyone’s risk aversion will undoubtedly get worse.

Last August, when the North Korean nuclear crisis escalated, South Korean conglomerates flooded into the cryptocurrency market.

At the time, the price of Ether rose 67% in two weeks, pushing it close to $300.

Back in June 2016, England formally decided to leave the European Union through a “Brexit referendum”.

Bitcoin rose 25% the same day, reaching a price of $714.

Some believe Bitcoin has a similar safe-haven quality to gold. The financial market uncertainty caused by Brexit has let people to choose Bitcoin.

​

While cryptocurrencies are slowly emerging as a new haven asset, it is not enough to prove that the transition from online lending is a wise choice.

“It may being jumping from the tiger’s den into the wolf’s den.” states Mr. Qian, “You need to pay tuition to get into this business.”

The unspoken rules and operations in this field are extremely complex. New, unfamiliar users metaphorically face a bloody battlefield.

And the P2P giants that have entered the field could become the next wave of victims.

“These people can’t play the coin market; they will be frisked down the moment they enter” states an anonymous person who helps P2P bosses enter the cryptocurrency market. In this sector, P2P bosses are still too naive.

The cryptocurrency market has not been friendly and welcoming towards the incoming funds, instead resisting it with everything they have.

​

Note:

Looking back at the online lending industry, it is not all doom and gloom.

An industry’s upward and downward trends are inevitable, as some leave, some will stay.

Some practitioners believe after this wave of closures, the remaining people will be the elite.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Advice on how to go about paying car debt.,"Hello everyone! 
I am seeking advice on which route to take for paying off my car loan. FYI I live in Queensland, Australia. My credit rating is below average due to some poor choices in my younger years. My goals are to become debt free and raise my credit rating to increase my chances of getting a home loan in the (hopefully) near future. 

Starting finance value was around $31,000.
I have about $17,500 AUD remaining. Interest rate is 11.9%. Loan term was 5 years, commenced in July 2017. 
Current repayments are $174.95 per week. 

I earn an average of $1550 per week, with total weekly expenses being $680. 

Current savings is about $2500.

I read recently that paying out a car loan early can be detrimental to your credit rating, as future lenders don’t see early payouts as ideal. Does anyone have any information about this? 

Part of me wants to just put every spare dollar into paying out the loan ASAP in order to stop paying interest and have an extra $175 back in my pocket each week. 
However, if that would lower my credit score even further I wonder if I should just make extra repayments each week in order to bring it down faster. 
If I pay an extra $150 a week, I worked out that should pay the loan out in about a year (roughly).

Any advice on what would be the best approach to achieving my goals? 

Thanks in advance!",finance

personalfinance,What ducks to align for a future big move as a current 18 y/o,"Hi there. I apologize for any formatting transgressions (and the impending litany), this is being authored on my mobile.

 I currently live in South Dakota, and I want to get out of this genuine cesspool of a locality. Many people who live here try to move away, but they always seem to come back due to financial (among other things) impediments. I do not desire this fate for myself, so I want to line up my financial assets to create a failsafe  because I know myself all too well. 

I've been planning this move for years now (to Seattle, or nearby) and there's a lot I need to get done before it happens - I expect to undergo the transition some three years down the road. 

First, my background. I dropped out of High School my senior year because of problems concerning depression and other shortcomings, none of which are relevant at this time. I will be getting my GED as soon as I have funds to initiate my exams for peace of mind; I do not foresee this ever being an issue. 

What is an issue, however, is my outright lack of funds in this moment. I am living with my parents, have no job, and nothing in my checking or savings account. I do have a high-interest account under my name that my father created for me - at an unknown time - on 3 year recurring contracts (I would have to search for my documentation to know exactly what type of account this is). As it stands, this account has 30+ months remaining before it will be able to be modified or withdrawn from - and has approximately $2,000 to $2,500 within it at an unknown APR yield and interest rate - thank the mighty heavens this account exists. 

Anyways, I intend to find work in the form of full-time as soon as I am able. With this, I hope to accrue a healthy balance in my savings account - my paychecks will be able to be saved almost in their entirety (with virtually non discretionary spending) since I live with my parents who, while they are not necessarily supportive, could care less what I do. This is all just a big headache with money and getting a degree &amp; I just want to be on my own exploring Washington state nature. It's really messing with my head and figuring all this financial stuff out will hopefully relieve some of my stress.

My inquiry is as follows:

1. What are my first steps at this moment?

2. What forms of financial security - or otherwise - will I need before I can begin to consider moving? (I will try to get a job in WA before I actually move, albeit I know it will be exceedingly difficult - this question concerns any other necessary financial assets).

(Augmented list)

3. What is an appropriate sum of funds I should retain in order to move? My calculations indicate somewhere in the range of 15-20 grand as a *minimum* for moving there.

I will likely have more to add to this at a later time - it is currently 3AM so I will probably answer your comments in the morn. Any counsel you wish to provide on your own volition is welcome.

Edit: I failed to mention I have about 2-3 grand in liquid assets.

As always, 

kindest regards,

and thanks in advance.",finance

personalfinance,Changing up my retirement plan,"I just want to make sure I'm not missing anything here. I'm 28, make 59k and my wife makes 32k in grad school. As the person who makes more, I'm the one who's putting money into retirement for both of us. Right now, I put away 9% of gross, plus a 4% match from my employer into my 401k.  We currently have about 21k in retirement. I know that should be more, but we're trying to simultaneously deal with our 57k in student loan debt, and prepare for a down payment on a house so that we can finally start having part of our housing costs build equity.


I had been putting all 9% of my money into a Roth account because someone told me I should do that once because I'm young. Now I'm realizing that our marginal federal tax rate is 25%, which will probably be higher than our average tax rate when we retire (and if not, that means we're doing pretty good in retirement and I'd rather have the money now). I also had looked at my fees from my 401k (after seeing that John Oliver episode) and it had been $35 a year, which wasn't that much, so I never considered creating an IRA.

Then I discovered this reddit and realized that there might be other fees.  I dug through my emails and realized that on page four of an annual disclosure, there's also an annual 0.7% fee.  That fee doesn't show up at all anywhere in the reporting about my actual 401k, and my employer says that the gains reported are actually the net gains after that fee.  Even with the small amount of money that I have in there now, that's already $150 a year.  My plan is to shift my contributions to a traditional 401k, drop them to the minimum I need for the employer match (5%), and put whatever the difference is in take home pay into a traditional IRA with Vanguard.  My questions are:

Is that 0.7% fee that I get charged annually the same thing as an expense ratio?

Is it legal for Ameritas not to put it on any of the reporting related to my 401k account (account history, fees, etc.)?

Is Vanguard a good way to go?

Does my plan make sense and am I missing anything else that I should be doing?",finance
personalfinance,Convincing parents to let me take students' loan (HU),"First time posting here, also an ESL, so excuse my lack of terminology.

For context, I am 21 and living with my parents in Hungary (Central-East Europe). After graduating from high school, I attended a 2-year vocational course, and now I've applied for University and got accepted.

Since I filed my application in the summer, I couldn't get any tuition grants, and therefore we will have to pay all fees.

I wouldn't want my parents having to make tough choices regarding finances, but we could barely afford to pay the tuition fees.

On the other hand, they are adamantly opposed to the idea of me getting students' loan, and I feel like it's a thing of pride for them.

personalfinance,"Weekly ""which car should I buy?"" thread","Hey friends,

Here's the situation: last week, I sold my newer-model Buick to get rid of the very high car payments for our income (combined $73k, payments were over $450). The very next day, our GMC Envoy's engine broke down on the side of the road with a diagnosis of $3,700 to lift the engine and replace the oil pan. The car has over 150k miles and is very beat up on the exterior; it also needs new tires and struts and shocks, so the total bill to get it up and running in tip-top shape is well over $5k.

So now we're getting right back to car loan land, but trying to do it right this time (we currently do not have the cash for a used car (was hoping to save while we had the Envoy and buy something for 6-7k in cash), FYI, because we just moved and got married in the same week, which was very expensive). Trying to decide if this is a good idea or not:

PenFed Auto Loan:
$10,000 Principal
3.74% interest
48 Month Term
Payments of $224.63

Considering buying one of the following:

2010 Toyota Prius, 111k miles, $9,000.

2013 Honda Civic Coupe, 60k miles, $12,000.

Both vehicles are fully loaded. Also considering a used Hyundai Sonata or a used Ford Fusion, but would prefer a hatch or coupe.

btc,Systemic risks and issues with traditional banks &amp; BCH vs BTC.,"Commercial banks (the kind of bank the average person uses) almost always hold fractional reserves. This means that they lend out far more currency than they actually have. For instance: an American commercial bank might only have 10 million dollars of actual physical notes (printed by the Federal Reserve, central bank) in their vault. However this commercial bank may have legally lent 60 million dollars to their customers (via purely digital transactions). Obviously they don't have 60 millions dollars, they only have a fraction of that amount in their reserves. Their customers then digitally spend the recently created, debt-based dollars at shops and other places and those dollars enter full circulation within the economy.

You have almost certainly received some of these fractional-reserve dollars if you are American. It's the same situation with euros, yen, British pounds and almost every other fiat currency.

There are a number of problems with this:

1. If lots of people tried to actually redeem their dollars from the bank (as physical notes), then the banks would either go bankrupt, would close up to stop people gaining access to their money or would have to be bailed out by the central bank or government. This has happened in the past. It's called a run on the bank. It is usually a disastrous and terrifying event for the people who falsely believed that their money was ""safe at the bank"".

2. Many people earn currency by providing value to others (selling goods or their services), but traditional, high-level bankers are a parasitic class of people who provide almost-no value to others and they survive by printing currency (which reduces the value of the currency of the people that actually earn it).

3. When commercial banks print currency, as stated above, they reduce the value of the existing currency in circulation. This is called inflation. It eats away at the earnings of the productive class and the spoils of this process go to the unproductive; banking class.

**So how does this related to BCH and BTC?**

Bitcoin (BCH) is special because unlike dollars and euros we are able to easily and quickly, digitally-trade real Bitcoins (or fractions of a real Bitcoin: bits), on chain. There will always be some exchanges or businesses doing fractional reserve banking (pretending they have more Bitcoins than they really do in order to profit), but because trading on chain is so fast and frictionless with Bitcoin, the amount of fractional reserve, fake-Bitcoins that can be created is **much** lower. So Bitcoin suffers **far** less from those 3 numbered points listed above. Everyone can safely hold and cheaply trade their real Bitcoins if they want to. This is an essential part of the design of Bitcoin

Bitcoin Core (BTC) is very similar to the old dollar banking model. With a constrained block chain, where trading on-chain is expensive and high friction, people are naturally incentivized to do off-chain trading of tokens that are not BTC coins but are only representative of them. This is the same as trading representative digital dollars instead of the real notes. As such Bitcoin Core (BTC) is very vulnerable to those 3 numbered points listed above (inflation, runs on the bank and feeding parasites). Just think back to the very high BTC fees of December 2017. Ask yourself how many people were probably holding many of their BTC coins at exchanges (banks) like Coinbase so that they could quickly and cheaply trade them if they needed to? The December fees are not intended to be a 1 time thing. The proponents of BTC see it as a natural and desired state of the BTC chain. Greg Maxwell famously [commented about popping champagne](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2017-December/015455.html) in celebration, during this period of high fees.  

What I have just explained is one of the many reasons I favour Satoshi's design for Bitcoin (BCH) over Greg Maxwell's replacement design (BTC) (where the blockchain is only used as a settlement system).

---
A final comment: for those that think that the Lightning Network will or could protect the BTC chain from those 3 issues I pointed out, you may want to look into something called the **Extended Lightning Network**. You can read about it here:

https://medium.com/fairlayer/xln-extended-lightning-network-80fa7acf80f3

The TL;DR is: The Extended Lightning Network is a project to solve the liquidity problems present in the Lightning Network (the author calls it the ""receivability and inward capacity problem""). The solution the author has come up with and implemented is a version of the Lightning Network which adds ""extended credit"" (or ""uninsured money""). In other words: the solution is... **creating and trading fake BTC**.

Let us not let this cycle of fiat currency, parasites, inflation &amp; debt continue.

personalfinance,"[CA - Bay Area] Mid 20s, $72k windfall, don't want to put it towards student loans","Hi all,

Just looking for some advice on a smallish windfall I've run into (small by the terms of stuff I read on here). Combined with a signing bonus and an insurance settlement check, I have about $72k in the bank currently.

Sorry for the very, very long post. I figured more information/background is better than less. Posting on mobile, will try my best with appropriate formatting.

&amp;nbsp;


**TL;DR: $72k windfall, ~$30k left over after paying off CC debts/setting up emergency fund. Don't want to put it to student loans. Am I crazy? If not, what should I do with it to get higher than 4% returns?**

&amp;nbsp;


Before we begin, I understand I have high credit card debt. It was sort of planned, as I knew the windfall was coming, and there were a lot of expenses (wedding, medical, moving) that I put on 0% cards with the intent of paying them off with the windfall. 

&amp;nbsp;


**Basic background information:**

* Mid 20s, married, no kids, 6 month old dog, SO in graduate school not working, recently finished undergrad myself

* Bay Area CA, Engineer. Extremely stable company

* ~$100k/year gross, ~$5.4k/month take home after taxes, benefits, and 6% match into 401k (max match, they also chip in a free 3.5%). No IRA 

* Roughly $22k across credit cards. About $10k is at 0% for a few more months, but the rest is in the teens.

* Combined $105k student loans (SL) between the both of us, split almost even between ~4% federal, 6% private, all fixed rates

* Monthly expenses right around ~$5k

* SO grad school ~$10k/year, first year covered by grants/aid. Probably won't be that way for the rest of her time.

* No car payments, though my SO wants a new car badly lol


&amp;nbsp;


**Monthly expense breakdown:**

* $2600 rent/water/sewage/utilities/internet/electricity (Way too much for a two bedroom apartment, but non-negotiable for a roommate situation).

* $1200 student debt minimums

* $400 food

* $300 commuting (train pass + gas)

* $250 phone bill, auto insurance, renters insurance

* $200 discretionary/date nights

* $50 dog

* Planning on putting remaining monthly income towards paying for future SO grad school.


&amp;nbsp;


**The plan:**

* $22k towards CC debt

* $10k emergency fund

* $5k to parents for fronting physical therapy

* $5k short-term savings/rainy day/buffer for monthly expenses

* $30k ... thats the question


&amp;nbsp;


**The future:**

* SO is thinking of picking up part time work to fill the gap in yearly tuition. Wouldn't be much, just enough to cover costs.

* SO graduating grad school in 2.5 years, expected yearly income on the low end at $60-70k. 


&amp;nbsp;


**The problem:**
I understand the most taditional /r/personalfinance advice is going to be putting that towards SL. I really don't want to do that. This is another story, but that insurance money cost me a lot of my long-term mobility (car accident).

Its tough mentally to just throw anything I'll ever get as ""recempense"" for what I went through towards paying ""only"" 30% of a massive student debt. Our current plan is for me to keep making the minimums, then once my SO starts work, put the bulk of that income towards SL, at least $30k/year. Totally debt free in six years from now.

Mental health aside, I like the idea of keeping that as seed money for a down payment. I know $30k doesn't scratch the surface for a down payment in the Bay Area, but it's still better than nothing.


&amp;nbsp;


**The question:**
Short of putting it towards SL, what should I do with the left over $30k? I know /r/churning is a little controversial here, but I've been thinking about churning checking/savings accounts between me and my SO.

Using the $30k as seed, I think we could easily clear $2k/year between the two of us, if not closer to $3k. At 35% tax rate, that still puts APY at least 4.3%, which I don't think is too bad for practically no risk and very high liquidity. 

Another option is to try and invest it. I just opened a Charles Schwab checking/brokerage account, don't know if the expected returns from the brokerage account, or something like Vanguard, would exceed 4.3%. I'd want to stay pretty conservative and fairly liquid. For reasons stated above, losing this seed money would be pretty devestating mentally.

My current plan is to either park the emergency fund, or if I go the churning route, roll it into the seed money to increase the maximum number of accounts we can meet qualifications for per year.

Am I missing something obvious? If the verdict is I am absolutely batshit and should just put it toward SL, I'll consider that. I've run some preliminary numbers on what I'd be saving in the long term, and I don't find the numbers compelling enough to overcome my mental blocks. Let me know if I've left out any useful information.

personalfinance,Loan Priority Payment Question,"I am receiving my yearly bonus in the upcoming month and I am looking to utilize a good amount to pay off loans.

Loan 1 - $992 @ 6.8% 

Loan 2 - $2650 @ %4.5

Loan 3 - $293 @ 5.6%

I know to typically pay off the higher interest rate balances first, and therefore my obvious first loan will be paid off first with the respective allocation from my bonus. However, is it smarter to pay off Loan 3 off second, or because it is a smaller balance to pay off as much on Loan 2 as possible?

personalfinance,Wells Fargo Sending Interest Rate Reduction Notices for Closed Accounts,"Wells Fargo just mailed me a notice, letting me know I may be able to reduce the interest rate on my student loans. Very nice of them to be so forthcoming. However... I paid my student loan with Wells Fargo in full back in 2014. To make sure I didn't screw something up, I checked my credit report, and it shows my Wells Fargo student loan as closed in 2014 as expect. In addition when I try to access my account online with the account number provided in the notice, I am told it doesn't exist (which makes sense cause it was closed four years ago).   


My question is, why is Wells Fargo mailing me interest rate reductions for an account that is closed? This is making me nervous that I may have been caught up in scam Wells Fargo was running, opening multiple accounts for people without their permission. To be clear, I have no other accounts or business with Wells Fargo (that I know of). My credit report does not show any active accounts with Wells Fargo either.

personalfinance,I flunked out of college and im already in the hole. Should I try to finish it out?,"My education has been a nightmare. I waited until sophomore year to switch my major to what I wanted to get my degree in (went from chemistry to CS) and this was at the one of the top university in my region. 

Then i met a girl and she broke my heart sending me into a spiriling depression. I failed my 2nd semester junior year and got put on academic probation. Then i was still so mentally fucked up that I failed again my 1st semester senior year and finally got the boot at the start of my 2nd semester senior year.

So now I am 60K (30 federal, 30 private) in the hole and no degree. I want to finish eventually but who would take me in with such a horrible academic track record?

 I live at home for now and pay 750 total a month for my loans, which is like 37% of my monthly income. I don't know if I can afford to go back and get more debt but I really need to get a degree cause I make decent money at the job im at now, but there is no path upwards and forwards.",finance
personalfinance,"Any recommendations for down payment assistance that won't increase home loan interest rates? (Pima County, AZ)","Buying a condo for $128,000 (conventional loan) with 3% concessions from the seller. Doing the inspection this Sunday, so may be able to mitigate a lower price or get credit for needed repairs or updates.

Would need another 3% ($3,840) for down payment to lock in lowest interest rate possible. (4.5%-4.75% with the Fannie Mae HomeReady conventional loan, which will also reduce PMI rates.)

If I were to use the normal Down Payment Assistance Programs instead, lowest rate I could get is 5.375% interest with normal PMI rates for a 3% down payment. (The 4 and 5 percent DPs would be 5.75% and 6.25% respectively for the interest rate for the 30 year loan. Yeah, no thanks.)
Essentially the DPA would outlive it's usefulness in about two years due to the increased interest rate.

So I wanted to see if there were any other resources people here know of or have been able to use to assist (even partly) in the down payment without increasing interest rates.

Trying to vet some options before resorting to asking family members for a ""gift"" to cover the rest of the DP that we can't.


Background:
The housing market is going up like crazy and basically anything under $300,000 is snatched up off the market in under 5 days. 
Home value and interest rates for home loans are expected to only increase the next few years at least, and my fiancée was just able to triple her income within the month of August (Net total of $4,000-$4,500/month with the both of us) so we decided to jump on buying a place to compete with the rising rental market, even though we haven't had a lot of time to save up with her new job.

personalfinance,Taking out a loan to pay debts,"I read somewhere (on a bank website, so I'm hesitant) if I'm in debt (and both myself and husband are in more ways than one, car, credit cards) I should take out a loan (if it's possible) to pay off the multiple debts so I just have one debt from one source. I've seen that the interest on a loan could be from 4.99% and up while my other debt sources have an interest rate much higher (I have one that is 14% and another that is 24%). 

Is this a scam? Good idea? Thanks for any advice in advance!",finance
personalfinance,"Have $50,000 HELOC from a divorce and $65,000 in Whole Life policy ... should I cash out and pay off the HELOC?","I got divorced a few years ago. As part of our agreement, in order to keep the house, I also took on all of the debt attached to the house, which mostly consists of a $50,000 draw on a $100,000 line of credit. I've watched the payment start to go up over the last few months and it got me more concerned about the money I'm wasting on the interest on the HELOC. The primary mortgage is 3.75% on a 15 year ... I'm not interested in touching that or a refi. 

So ... I thought perhaps I would cash out enough from my Whole Life Insurance policy to pay off the HELOC and just get it off my back. Borrowing against the Life Insurance is 8% so that doesn't make sense when the HELOC is at just under 5% right now, but I guess I could surrender the policy for the cash and use it to pay off the HELOC. 

Does anyone have an opinion on if that is the best approach? I guess I'm more concerned about what the tax implications would be in cashing out the policy. My other thought is just leave it as it is and try to put much more money toward the HELOC debt every month but that's just been more difficult to do than I thought it would be. Are ther any alternatives to get the HELOC off of this floating interest rate?

personalfinance,"Out almost $2,000 on a car I didn't want and gave back.","So about two and a half years ago my dad found a really good deal for $500 down and $800 repairs on a first generation Honda Insight. 
He decided that it was about time I owned my own car and bought it for me. I was only sixteen at the time and decided to at least give it a shot. 
It was a good car and, other than the repairs, there was nothing wrong with it but I just wasn't really ready to own a car. 
Early this year I had made up my mind and let him keep it when kept his name on the registration, after I payed for insurance for over a year. He finally just now got it under his own insurance the month before last and I had still been paying on it. 
I don't really care if I get the insurance money back but I feel like I should at least ask for the repair money back. My boss said I should at least try to work something out but I'm kinda nervous. My dad and I aren't really on bad terms but I haven't talked to him much other than car related stuff in almost a year.

Feel free to ask for more info in the comments and I'll respond when I have time.

~Edit: 
The car is currently in my dad's name but my grandfather is using it. I don't have access to the car unless I were to go over and ask for it. I really don't want it though and I have no real interest in selling it to someone else.
I think the money, that I paid in repairs, would be better off in a savings account where I can let it grow interest.
Last I checked I have a 2% interest rate on my savings account that my bank pays me for keeping money there. It may have gone down to .2% but I would have to look.
My dad is pretty well off on his own so $900 would not be hard for him and I'd be willing to wait for tax rebates.",finance

I am currently employed at a technology company servicing printers and managing copy rooms for $14.50/hr and I am also in the Army National Guard. I just finished my annual training and was assigned to the trail portion at my home station (not in my city) that was basically a clean up assignment and I have some acquaintances that work full-time for the Guard in various ways. One of these acquaintances has connections to someone who works in my city and needs someone to fill a position while the regular employee is on a deployment. I was recommended by the acquaintance and sent a resume and they have scheduled a meeting with me tomorrow to discuss the job and allow me to ask questions.

The deployment is 9 months long, which will be how long I would be taking the position for. For those (un)familiar with how the guard works, there are Active Guard Reserve positions (AGR), ADOS (temporary) and Tech positions that are like government contracted civilians. Obviously, there are your regular drilling soldiers as well. This position is what is called a GS07 and it could be a great foot in the door to a full-time position with the government (Federal, State or with the Army National Guard). 

If offered the position, I'd be making a lot more money than I currently do but only for a short time, and possibly have an opportunity to open a door for myself down the road if I do a good job there. 

Do I take the job? Or stay with the company I am working for currently? I've only been employed there for a couple of weeks and I don't like the idea of burning a bridge when I don't have to, but I feel like this sort of opportunity won't come around again for a long time, if at all.

They are both private loans and we have called both companies to see if they would be able to give us a lower monthly payment over a longer term but neither of them are willing to do so, because it is considered a fixed term loan. Considering all of her monthly expenses, when we need to move into a new apartment in a few months she will literally have $0 at the end of every month after paying rent, loans, utilities, car insurance, Etc. 


Does anyone have any advice or any suggestions on what to do about the situation? It will be nearly impossible for us to move into an Apartment (which we need to do before next summer), and I don't want her to need to default on her loan and just stop paying it, though I don't know if those consequences would be worse than not being able to pay rent and keep ourselves afloat. 


TL;DR: Girlfriend won't be able to afford her private student loans soon. What are the realistic penalties for defaulting on a loan of around $24k? 

Edit: Defaulting is not a good option. Will inform her.

Is there a way to find some bank that would buy the loans to repay at a longer term? 

Would it be possible to consolidate the loans to one loan with the lower interest rate?


There are two loans. 


Loan A has $23,000 left on it, a payment of $188 a month, and an interest rate of 5.78% (variable).

personalfinance,Eliminate (most of) Emergency Fund to Pay Debt?,"My husband and I have about $55k in student loan debt (\~half in federal conslidated loan @ 2.6% interest and half in private refinanced loan @4.25% interest).  We have no other debts (and only one credit card that we pay off completely every month just to get the rewards). 

I was recently motivated by Dave Ramsey's podcast/program to use $15k we had been saving up to buy a first home to get that down from $70k this past week (to pay off three smaller loans that had 5%, 5.16%, and 5.9% interest rates). It feels goooooood.

I know Dave Ramsey's program would have me drain all but $1k in my Emergency Fund (we have just under $15k in there, which could cover 3-4 months of expenses, larger emergencies, or multiple emergencies at once) as well to pay off more debt, which would get me down to $40k in debt immediately. 

The momentum of paying off debt so quickly is like a ""high"" but the lowering of our emergency fund makes me feel really anxious.

personalfinance,"(US) Okay ... buying a new car is never an ""investment"", but, after gas savings, federal, state, and local rebates ... it's kind of silly not to buy an electric car if I can afford it, right?","Here's the gist: I currently drive a 2011 Mazda3, (hatchback, grand touring trim level, purchased new, paid off awhile back) and just hit 100,000 miles on it, which means that my extended powertrain warranty is now expired. I've taken fairly good care of it, and it still runs great. I need new tires in the immediate future, but it's otherwise in pretty good shape. 

That said, I commute about 60 miles every weekday, and so am paying about $100-120/mo in gas. 

Out of curiosity, I started looking at the 2018 Nissan Leaf. Feature-wise, I like it, and while I don't *love* the look, it's waaaay better than the previous models. 

I've got an offer from a local dealership for a Leaf for $27,670 (for the mid-level trim package. MSRP is $34,000). That price includes 72-month 0% financing and $2,000 cash back from Nissan. 

I should also be eligible for the full $7,500 federal tax credit, $2,500 state rebate (CA), and my local electricity company is offering a $599 rebate on EV purchases.

It looks like my Mazda is worth about $6,000 trade-in, but I don't have a trade-in quote from the dealership yet. On Craigslist, they're going for $7,000ish, it looks like (listing for that much, at least). 

Math-wise, say I get $5,000 trade-in. That's about $200/mo (including taxes and registration). Minus my monthly gas bill, plus maybe $30/mo for added electricity (if I can't get into the free chargers at work), it sure feels like I'm getting a brand new car for about $110/mo. 

What am I missing? Maintenance on EVs seems to be low, except for needing to replace the batteries eventually (Nissan recommends after 100,000 miles, but it's dependent on how they're holding their max charge), which *is* a big cost. 

Is there a catch I'm not seeing? It seems like even if I want to sell it in a few years, I'll come out on the better end of things. Though, a lot of the value of EVs is likely due to the credits/rebates, which wouldn't apply to used cars, so I suspect they don't hold value well.

Thoughts? Warnings?

Thanks!

personalfinance,Can we afford a $300k house on our budget?,"Looking for some cold hard insight from the pf hive mind to make sure we're not being reckless. 

Here's our situation: couple, both 31, with me making $60k, spouse currently between jobs so we're not factoring in her income at all (if - hopefully when - new job appears, that will be bonus money, but we want this budget to work on just my income). I am guaranteed at least a 10% raise over the next six years (union contract with employer sets this in stone). Most of that extra money will go into me progressively increasing my 401k contributions (at the moment I put aside 5% to ensure I unlock the maximum employer match). 

We have no debt. Monthly take-home pay after taxes, retirement deductions, insurance premiums etc. is about $3600. Once all expenses are accounted for we are left with $500-$1000 in savings each month.

Our current rent is $1350 for a 1br apartment, which is low/average for the area (safe, near work so low commute - our one car gets driven ~10 miles per week, mostly to the grocery store; I walk to work, saves on gas and wear and tear). We want to buy a house in the same area because 1) we really love it, 2) it's a great school district if we start a family in the next few years, and 3) houses aren't substantially cheaper in other parts of this metro, except in very unsafe/undesirable areas.

Through a combination of many years of saving and some recent inheritance money, we have about $120k available for down payment, closing costs, and up-front housing expenses (plus $50k in emergency savings that we won't touch). 

House prices here are in the low $200ks for old and often disrepaired homes around 1k-1.5k square feet. The advantage of buying such a home is that monthly costs (including taxes and home insurance) would be equal or lower than our current rent with a ~$100k down payment - a house between $200k and $250k would have a monthly payment between $1000 and $1350 on current 30-year interest rates (4.5-5%).

*IF* we can stretch to the $275k-$300k range, much nicer options become available: newer homes with well-maintained and often upgraded interiors, square footage closer to 2000. However, even with $100k down, that would push our mortgage payment up to the $1400-$1700 range - a substantial increase on our current housing costs, without even factoring in higher utility bills and home maintenance compared to a rented apartment.

So - with apologies for the long backstory - my question is if you think it would be unwise to go for the higher priced homes (up to $300k), and whether the cons of having lower financial wiggle room would outweigh the pros of a much nicer home. Or do you think we should pause our home ownership plans for now, and save up an even larger down payment so that we could afford the higher-priced homes with a monthly payment comparable to our current rent?",finance

I have made rank quickly and been fairly responsible with money.... I thought this until I found a few financial blogs and this Reddit. Reality check, big time.

Here's my current situation.

6500 in savings, 4000 in physical silver, 10k in TSP.

I own 3 vehicles. A project car that's paid for and 98% done, my daily and wife's/family car. I owe about 7k on each. About 8k in equity in one and 13k in the other. This is our only debt.

Single income, small raise next month and another small raise this time next year. We currently put 400 a month into our Roth TSP. I stopped our TSP this month and opened an account with Charles Schwab.

My plan is to start a Roth IRA so I can withdraw contributions if I were to retire early or need the money post military. I will bump up contributions to max the IRA each year and put the excess money towards paying off our vehicles.

I will be getting about 7k in bonus money and plan to pay off my car. This will free up another $130 per month. My tax return will be about 6-7k as well... Should I pay off the other car as well? That would free up ~160 a month.

Both interest rates are below 3%

I have debated on using all money in excess of my max contribution and throwing it into savings in expectation of a market reset so I can buy into an index fund ""on sale"" but I know how this group feels about timing the market.

Next month I will have 600-700 a month I can easily save, a year from now 800-900 is doable. We are analyzing our budget now to find room to cut back (we know there is definitely room for improvement)

personalfinance,What to do about my godawful 2007 Jeep Compass and/or commute?,"Hi all, first time posting here!

Fair warning that this is kind of long.

So when I was 19 I bought a 2007 Jeep Compass. I got screwed when it came to the interest rate. It's \~22% so all-in-all I'm paying 14k for a vehicle that was originally worth 8k. I still owe $4300 if I pay it off all in one go as of this month.

The monthly payment is $250.  I currently make around $1000 a month and my only other expenses are my phone and previous student loans, which are $45 and $50 per month respectively. I also pay gas every other week which is usually $38, and sometimes food.

The problem is that expensive issues won't stop popping up. I'm taking it to a mechanic soon to get a diagnostic done, but so far I've spent a little over 2k this past year alone on maintenance and it does not look like that trend is going to stop. I know for a fact the struts and tires are the next thing that need done, and lately it has had trouble starting despite having a new battery and alternator. I get that older cars need a lot of work, but I'm not sure if it's financially feasible anymore. :/  My concern is that it will break down completely (e.g. need the transmission rebuilt or some other expensive repair) and I will be stuck making payments on a useless car for another 2 years.

As far as public transportation goes, I get a free bus pass from school. It's only 30 mins to school but over an hour to work...I am pretty concerned with having a 2 hour commute on days I work, mostly because I'm afraid it will take away time from school.

Also, we are moving to a city with much better public transportation in a year because I am transferring schools. It would not take half as long to get places with public transport, and I am really tempted to sell the car because of that and the fact that I don't know when I will have a job there. I may have to live off of savings for awhile and a car affects that.

We have discussed this and have come up with some options:

* Pay for any repairs/maintenance need done and just suck it up until the car's paid off.
* Sell it, and put the car payment money into savings every month and just take the bus for a year.
* Sell it, and buy a better used car.
* Sell it, and move closer to work/school.
* Get a closer job.

What would you personally do?

EDIT: I forgot to add, another option we came up with is that I sell it and then get an ebike, so that way I still have some form of fast(ish?) transportation. I really don't know how feasible that is!",finance

business,New Google Pay app to offer Indians quick loans,"On Tuesday, Google announced that it would be partnering with a bunch of Indian banks to bring instant quick loans to the masses as part of its Next Billion Users initiative. The move saw the Google Tez app being rebranded to Google pay, and soon users will be able to avail loans from various banks via the app. 

The announcement came at Google India's annual event in New Delhi.

Google announced that it had partnered with several private banks - namely, HDFC Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, ICICI Bank, and Federal Bank - and that quick loans with minimal paperwork would be facilitated through these banks.

Additionally, Google said it was working to bring more banks on to its new Google Pay platform.

 

Google had launched the India exclusive Google Tez app in September 2017, and had integrated it with India's Unified Payments Interface (UPI) in a bid to tap into the Indian digital transactions market.

However, now, Google Pay will not just be restricted to India, but will also be available in other countries as part of Google's push to unify all its payments offerings globally.",finance
personalfinance,"Going to start paying on student loans soon. I read that after 30 years if your loans are not paid off, they are forgiven, but you pay tax on the amount forgiven. Can someone explain how that works?","Trying to find a good number that will match my starting salary to make payments on my loans. I am at approx $45,000 in loans with interest included. I recently read that if your loans are not paid off within 30 years they're forgiven but you pay tax on the forgiven portion. The main example was a woman who got her bachelors and masters, spent 6 total years in school and graduated with $70,000 in loans, paid just about $50,000 back so far (on average $410/month) and still owes $65,000 due to interest. This scared me. 

I'm not very good with numbers nor am I caught up on tax rates and such. If that is the case, would it make more sense to just make the minimum payment every month and then pay tax on the amount forgiven in 30 years?

personalfinance,Where to open a new checking account? (and maybe savings),"I just got married and my wife and *finally* have all the paperwork out of the way to be able to merge our finances. Currently we both bank with PNC on student accounts that have our parents' names on them too. So, since we can pick between the thousands of available banks out there, I figured I'd see what you all thought.


We're currently living in New England while I finish my degree, but will *probably* move to the Midwest next summer. We currently have about $5000 in our accounts. I'm not opposed to online only checking, but part of me still feels like it's useful to have a physical branch that I can go to and be guaranteed to talk to a person face to face. Finally, we're looking for something that's free or we can easily have the fee waved.


Another thing, is it worth it to have a separate savings account these days? I've seen high yield checking accounts with better interest rates than my current savings. Is there any other benefit to splitting up the total in our account if the checking account is also earning interest? Or is it better to have savings because the interest earning checking accounts aren't recommended?


Edit: we also both expect to be enrolled in full time graduate programs for the next few years if that student status makes any difference.",finance
personalfinance,Renting Until Retirement?,"Hi all,

My wife and I are planning our future and I just wanted to double-check that our idea is sound.

Due to the cost of living in our area (Fairfax County, VA), we are unable to purchase the kind of home that we would like on a 15-year mortgage payment that we could easily afford.  We **could** manage something less ideal, especially on a 30-year mortgage, however that not the direction that we want to go.

We do want to own a home eventually however, so the current plan is rent until retirement and then purchase a home using our retirement savings.

Assuming we rent for no more than $1,900 per month, we should be able to comfortably contribute $712 every two weeks (the $18,500 annual maximum) toward my Thrift Savings Plan (Roth).  Assuming an average 7% rate of return, this should end up growing to at least $4 million at age 65, at which time we could assume a 15-year mortgage or withdraw about $750,000 to purchase a home in cash.

With $3 million leftover and no debt plus a federal pension (and possibly social security), we should have more than enough to live comfortably.

Is this a good idea, or stupid?  Thoughts?

Thank you for your help.",finance
personalfinance,Should I wait 4 years to qualify for VA home loan?,"Hey guys, have a question about buying a home.  Here's the relevant points:

1. In the national guard, 2 years into my 6 year contract.
2. Apparently for guardsmen you can qualify for a VA loan after 6 years, OR if you serve 180 of active duty service at some point.
3. When I first joined the national guard, right away my basic training + AIT training was 7 uninterrupted months on active duty pay (more than 180 days).
4. Income: Wife and I have combined income of almost $8k per month net.  Average about $10k on hand. 
5. Expenses: $1035 rent, one car payment $300, no kids, no debts besides student loans, the rest is just food/utilities/phones/etc., and we are not compulsive buyers.  Credit card paid in full every month, runs between $1k-$2k.
6. Student loans: $250k between us, both with advanced degrees, all federal, we are on ""income based"" which is much lower than we can afford, so we are making double / triple payments of about $3k-4k usually, throwing fistfuls of money directly at the highest interest loans (8.4% is the highest one), as we have nothing else we really need to pay for.  National guard pays $50,000 (before taxes) of it every time I sign 6 year contract, a portion disbursed every year I complete.  I plan to keep doing that until retiring after 20 years with full benefits.
7. We would be first time home owners, in a primarily rural midwest state but we live in one of the main cities that I don't believe qualifies for one of those rural home loans, unless we wanted to commute from farther out.  We hope to get a house where the mortgage + taxes etc. would be roughly equal to what we are currently paying for rent (so a $200k ish home, if feasible) 
8. Side note: My guard unit is entering its ""ready year"" in 2019, so if I get deployed (some are guessing a 25% possibility), it will be in 2020 for 1 year.

Question 1:  Given points 1-3, does anyone know if those 180+ days were ""active duty"" for the purposes of getting a VA loan?

Question 2:  If not, then should I wait another 4 years to qualify for a VA loan, or should we go ahead and try for a regular  home loan, or a rural home loan?  I have no idea how the housing market works, if THIS is a particularly good time to buy or if it will be better / worse in 4 years?  We want the best deal long term we can get, but we also are grumbling at the prospect of 4 years worth payments that could have been on a mortgage.

personalfinance,Is this a scam or legitimate medical debt? How do I find out for sure?,"I went to the emergency room recently. I received a bill soon after, my insurance had covered around 75%. A few days later, I received a different bill from another company asking me to pay for an emergency physicians assistant that they say was involved in treating me. 

Here's what's weird about it: 

The name is very suspicious. It's the name of the neighborhood where I was treated and ""Emergency Physicians,"" (so it's like I was treated in Brooklyn but the company's name is Williamsburg Emergency Physicians,) and their address is in another state entirely. 

I remember the names of the two people who treated me because they were unusual, and the name of the physician on the bill is neither of those. There was another woman in the room briefly, though, so this could be her. 

The bill specifically states not to call the hospital I was treated at if I have any questions, and lists an 800 number to call this company directly. 

They did not attempt to bill my insurance at all. 

Starting around the same time, I've been getting weird phone calls from spoofed numbers where they're clearly trying to get me to say ""yes"" to things. Like asking for someone who's not me, then saying ""do you want me to take you off this list, answer yes or no.""

personalfinance,Removing Debt Collection From Credit Report,"As a quick background, in March this year, I ordered a product online from China, and paid in full including shipping. I received the item by FedEx with no issues. After a few weeks, I moved away for a summer job at the start of May. All the bills I have are set-up to charge to my credit card or auto pay through online banking, and I was not expecting any bills to come in the mail.

I just returned home, and apparently after I had left, I was sent a bill from FedEx for $17.00. I guess the supplier did not pay enough to cover duty fees or something along those lines, even though I was under the impression the item was covered as it was delivered and I was not required to pay any more money to receive it. Anyway, because I was unaware of this bill (wasn't sent an email or called on my phone), I had missed the payment window. In my mail I also had a letter from NCO Financial - A collection agency, demanding payment for the $17.00. I was given a 10 day warning from them on July 23rd. I have also not been called or email from them.

Now at this point I am not sure what to do. I don't care about the $17.00, but I do not want this to be a permanent stain on my credit report. Before this, I had never missed a payment for anything, and it seems quite unfair that this could carry with me, seeing as I as completely unaware I was even responsible for making this payment. Should I just pay NCO online, or is there someone I should contact about this to try to explain the situation in hopes of having it removed from my report. I live in Ontario, Canada, if that matters. Thanks for any help - I am pretty ignorant about this sort of thing.

personalfinance,Pay off debt or save for real estate investing?,"I want to start investing in real estate in the next 1-3 years, basically whenever I have the money saved up and when I feel I have the knowledge to do so successfully. I’ve just started studying but I feel like the most important aspect at the moment is having a financial plan to get me there. I guess I should that I plan to do rentals or flips, whichever seems like the best option at the time, after I’ve learned enough to make that decision. 

I am 20 years old making 45-50k. My credit score is about 665. My current debt consists of a car loan of $6,100 at 9% for 6 years, which I just refinanced from 24%, I pay $136 a month. I was in a tough spot when I got the car and didn’t have much of a choice but to accept what I could, hence the previous high interest. My mortgage is $76,000 at 5.25% for 30 years, I pay $670 a month.And student loans totaling about $2500, don’t know the interest rate as it’s so low I haven’t considered it, I pay $50 a month. I’ve just paid off my Snap-On credit account which I was paying $200 a month on, double the minimum. And my Kay jewelers credit card that I got a few years ago to “build credit” in hind site I just wanted a nice watch lol, was paid off about 6 months ago. I was snowballing my debt to get it paid off as fast as possible because I though that was in my best interest. This gives me an extra $240 from snap on and kay. And $150 if I include the difference from my car payment before the refi. So I would be paying a total of roughly 520 a month on my car, and when that’s paid off, in a year and a half or so, I would go onto my student loans, then mortgage.

Now here’s why I’m considering saving it all. If I’m not paying extra on my debt I can save roughly $1500 a month. The extra money could expedite when I can start investing. Also, I think, but I’m not sure, that it could improve my credit score, increasing my chances of getting another mortgage in the near future.  Currently affecting my credit score negatively are the lack of age, total number of accounts, and number of hard inquiries. If I let my car and student loans ride out, it will increase the average age of my accounts. As for the number of accounts, my mortgage hasn’t hit my credit report yet as I make my first payment on the 1st of Sept. I plan to get a credit card and just use it for gas, my daily commute is about 60 miles so it will be used plenty lol. Im not sure where else I would add an account as I have no intentions of getting a merchant credit card or anything like that, however if it would help I’m not opposed. As for the hard inquiries, I have 17, about 10 of which came from trying to get approved for a car loan. I didn’t know what damage I was doing at the time. 
If I left out any relevant information, please ask. I appreciate any and all replies, thank you!

investing,Canada's Looming Debt Crisis,"Canada will face many headwinds over the coming years. Debt, immigration, pension funding, and deficits are all areas that economists can see the cracks. Here we will investigate the Debt issue more closely.

Debt:

Economists say that ‘Canada is 10 years behind the USA.’ Unfortunately, it seems that they are right again. The 2008 financial crisis was a result of overspending by the US consumer. 10 years later Canada isn’t in the same position, we’re in a worse position than the US was.

Canada’s consumer debt is skyrocketing and does not show any signs of slowing down. Debt to disposable income is unbelievably high coming in at 170% in Dec 2017 and with rising interest rates will likely be higher in Dec 2018.

To make matters worse housing prices have been rising over the same period. The new housing pricing index topped 103.20 in June 2018. The average home price has risen 45.01% over the last 5 years in Canada. Have the homes become 45% better? Of course not, but Canadians are still buying them.

How about the government, they aren’t getting involved in this debt picture right? Unfortunately, they are. Government debt to GDP levels are nearing 20-year highs. To make matters worse the Canadian government is aiming to balance the budget by 2019/2020. The odds of this balanced budget are extremely low however given the Liberal’s past 3 years.

Now add in the Central Bank of Canada. Their balance sheet is exponential. Whenever there is even a whiff of a recession the BOC swoops in to ‘save the day’ and purchase more equities. To make everyone happy the BOC lowers interest rates to the lowest rates seen to the Canadian consumer in history. Why wouldn’t you borrow? Money is cheap, everyone else is doing it, even the government is getting in on the spending action.

So where is the problem? It lies in inflation. Inflation is back in the Canadian market and it looks like it is here to stay. If inflation reaches a 3 handle in 2018 and possibly a 4 in 2019 as some economists have predicted the BOC will have to react. The BOC has indicated they will be raising rates and shrinking their balance sheet in the 2018 and 2018.

The picture we have painted is the perfect storm:

1. Highly levered consumer
2. High government spending still running deficits
3. Rising inflation
4. Rising interest rates
5. BOC decreasing spending and beginning to sell off assets

There is one wild card in all of this. If Canada runs into a recession or a financial crisis, the BOC could do the same as it did in 2008: Print money and buy equities. If this were to happen it could cause a quick fix, but the Loonie would feel the pain shortly after.

What’s the play? If you’re looking to make some money on this, consider a short CAD Bank, long US Bank strategy. The dividends you pay on your short position would be mitigated by your long position. The Canadian banks are trading at a 1.8 price to book ratio in comparison to a 1.41 P/B for US banks.

The Canadian banks have had a great run over the past 10 years, but their customers are stretched financially. Loan demand will begin to slow, and defaults will rise as interest rates rise. The result is a stronger US bank in comparison.

personalfinance,Parents decided to buy a house immediately which resulted to my girlfriend being stuck in financial duty. Need financial advice,"Throwaway because people know me.

For context, I and my girlfriend are in our 20s. I'm a full-time graduate student under a scholarship that keeps me fed, I give tutorials here and there for extra income, and I still live with my parents for the time being. My mother is retired while my father is self-employed. My girlfriend is a full-time employee teaching high schoolers. The allowance that I receive from my scholarship is around $500 a month where I give $300 to my parents: $100 for the ""rent"" they charge me with and $200 for required savings. My girlfriend earns around $500 per month as well. I also have a brother who is now living with his girlfriend. He also gives $100 to my parents every month because reasons.

Now, we rent a house around a nice neighbourhood. The problem is that when the rain pours hard, it always leaks. Badly. We've been here for almost three years but the condition does not get any better. The landlady does everything that she can to fix our roofs but it seems like the people that she hires are the ones that fuck up the place. My mother cannot take this anymore so she insisted that we go visit this site where we can scout for houses. It turns out that she has been browsing pages of developers selling houses on Facebook and someone messaged her about it which was why she came up with the idea.

Fast forward to the point where we were being enticed by the agents to buy a house and sign some contracts. The scheme is this: we will either pay monthly or in full the down payment, then we apply for a housing loan to the government, then we can move in once the government has approved our application. The problem is that the buyer should be someone that is a regular employee who earns around $500 a month. No one in our family has that criteria, not even my brother. That is the reason why my girlfriend got into the mix.

That night, I met with my girlfriend and she went home with us. We signed some papers since we explained to her that she would be named as the buyer of the house even though my family and I will be the ones to pay monthly. She agreed. The next day, my mother went to the agent to submit the signed papers, the requirements, and the reservation fee of $200. Because of that, it seems that everything is set.

Days after, one of our realizations sink in. My girlfriend was actually planning to quit her job sometime soon so that she can also study full-time to earn her graduate degree under the same scholarship that I am enjoying. The reason why she needs to quit is because the scholarship is only for applicants that are unemployed. But since she was named as the buyer of the house, this means that she can't quit her job for the next two to three years.

We then had a recent conversation about this. I was insisting her that we can call off buying the house (but the $200 reservation fee will not be refunded) so that she can continue what she wanted to do but she kept saying that it's for the best that we are starting to buy a house this early because house prices are steadily going up as days go by, even though I can clearly see that she does not really want to be in this predicament.

Should I convince my parents to call off the deal while also convincing them that $200 can easily be earned or should I listen to my girlfriend's long term insights about real estate? I know many factors are at play at this and I can only write so much in a post. If you have more questions before giving me advice, I would gladly tell them save for some that might be too personal.",finance

personalfinance,How mush of an impact does paying off a car have on credit?,"I bought my car back in Sept 2014. It cost 20k and I am paying at 19% interest over 72 month period. Had 0 to put for down. Santander was the only agency that would approve me for a loan since I had horrible credit. Score was like a 580 at the time. So that's 440 a month over 72 months is roughly 32k for the car. I couldn't put my wife on the loan because she wasn't working at the time. The maturity date is August 2020. I know that's a ridiculous interest rate but my car suddenly broke down, I had no way of getting to college and work, and I had a baby which I needed reliable transportation for. So I bit the bullet since I could afford the monthly payments. Anyway, I will be done paying it off this December. Roughly 20 months early and the total of my payments will be about 24000. Today, my score is 650.  So I have a few questions:

1: Any guesstimate of what my potential score range will be when I pay it off in December?

2: How long does it take for my score to actually change once I've made the final payment?

3: How will this affect my potential interest rate for a future vehicle purchase? We are looking to buy a nice SUV since we have 2 kids now and my wife's credit score is 710. Plus, we plan on putting at least 5,000 down for the next vehicle.

business,PSA: FedEx likes to try an scam businesses. Do NOT use them for business delivery.,"and*

My father runs a small contracting business (small, as in he is his only employee) and uses FedEx business delivery to receive shipments. These are generally bathtubs, tub liners, showers, and accessories as he mostly does bathroom demo/remodeling. He used other delivery companies in the past, but none of them were as consistent with delivery dates as FedEx. This in no way represents how they treat there customers though. 
FedEx was pressing my mother and father to use credit for paying for shipping, so that the costs could be directly charged to their account (possibly without my dad noticing). My dad, however, has refused this multiple times and has made it clear he wants to stick with paying by check. He contacts the FedEx office before the shipment arrives, so that he can write out the check ahead of time, and give it to the driver when they’re done unloading the truck. 
Today, my father got in contact with the same woman who always handles his phone calls about shipment costs. She told him that it would be $260. My mother was in the room as well, and she confirmed to me that they said $260. My father wrote out the check ahead of time like he always does, and unloaded the shipment. Then the driver gave him the bill. $360. $100 extra than what the quote was. My dad refused to give the extra $100, handed them the $260 check, packed his shipment up in our garage, and left for work. The driver stayed in our driveway for about 10 minutes before finally leaving. This is not the first occurrence of a situation like this, not even close, but it is the most recent. They have done this multiple times to my father, and it feels like they are trying to scam him. Had they agreed to paying with credit, they’d be getting hit with extra charges all the time, with nothing to do about it. 
Their “consistency” has also changed. They were always on time with deliveries, but that hasn’t happened for the past few months. 
I have already discussed with my mother that they should record any future phone calls, and that the next time they do this, it’s time to take legal action against the company (which they agreed, so if anyone from FedEx sees this, it’s time to get your shit in order). 
So, a PSA: don’t use FedEx for your business deliveries unless you absolutely have to. And if you are using them and you’re paying for your deliveries with credit, start calling in for shipping quotes the day before, and make sure they are actually charging you the amount they say they are. This is unacceptable and extremely sketchy business practice.",finance
personalfinance,Mortgage question: Negative points or Positive points?,"Hey All, 

My wife and I are in the process of purchasing our first house (appraisal was just done) and we are finalizing our loan with our local credit union. This is our first house, so its not in an ideal location, we only plan to live here for 3-8 years, until we can build up enough equity to move closer to work. But who knows what the future holds. 

The loan officer has two options for us that fall within the Jumbo 30 year fixed category. 

1. 4.5% interest, 0.375 points @ $1689.38 cost to us, P&amp;I  $2,282.62
2. 4.625% interest, -0.5 points @ ($2252.50) payment to us, P&amp;I  $2,316.20 

Both loans have identical closing costs, other than the points fee/discount, and both are 30 year fixed mortgages. The difference in my monthly payment between the two loans is $33.58

The mortgage adviser is trying to convince us that the negative points (higher interest rate) is worth it, because we get $2252.50 toward our closing cost and it only costs us $33.58 a month. She says that to pay the difference in closing costs between the two mortgages $3941.38 ($1689.38 + $2252.50) would take 9.8 years for the bank to make its money back. 

I want zero points, but since these are my two options my gut feeling is to pay the points and get the lower interest rate. But the mortgage adviser does make a good point , we likely won't be here for over 9 years, and having almost no closing costs (due to seller kickback and the points discount) is awfully appealing.

Any advice?

personalfinance,Going to school (undergraduate and graduate) and surviving on loans (US),"I am a third year undergraduate student at my state's university and am going to be applying for pharmacy school.

I had to stop my schooling last fall for health reasons (severe depression and fulminant ulcerative colitis; I only say this as maybe it gives me a little leverage) unfortunately my GPA isnt the best due to my health concerns, but I have a renewed sense of excitement and dedication to my education and would like to fix that.

Now, my question is: is there any way that I can use loans for the remainder of undergraduate school and/or graduate school so that I may continue to pay rent and get groceries while dedicating my time to school? I dont think that with my remaining health issues I can successfully go to school and do work simultaneously without it GREATLY negatively impacting my chances for graduate school and simply getting an undergraduate degree.

I’m a 25 year old college grad currently at a loss for how to proceed. 

There are many online budget tools available, but I’d like to be able to talk to a real human who can help me set realistic standards and provide some guidance. 

Is there a place for this? Summary of some of my debt issues below: 

I have about $14,000 in credit card debt looming over me, from two Chase cards that are nearly maxed out. I have $20K in student loans at very low interest rates, but my recent promotion jacked up my monthly payment over $350 dollars, and I missed a payment. I also have a small personal loan through Upstart taken to cover moving costs after a break up left me out of an apartment, and a family health emergency had be traveling more than expected. That loan is about $5K with a low interest rate as well. 

I have a large amount in my 401K already with a good employee match program at work. I think I can manage the student loan and personal loan with no issue, and would have no budgeting problems on my salary if I didn’t have massive credit card payments to cover (as in, reducing my credit card debt could put me in a place where I wouldn’t have to lean on them).

personalfinance,"24 yr old taking out first student loan, need advice","Hello!
I'm 24 and starting a Master's in education in September to become a teacher. I have my BS in Biochemistry and MS in biology already. I don't have any student loans from BS or MS(biology) because my dad paid for my education. The program I'm enrolled in is 17 courses, each $1,935 USD for a total of $32,895 USD. I filled out my first FAFSA and have discussed with financial aid personnel at the university. I will receive two disbursements of $20,500 USD that will obviously more than cover the cost of the program. I am waiting to see how much I qualify for in subsidized loans, with the rest being unsubsidized I believe. I received an email saying I was eligible for the TEACH grant and that I needed to fill out a counseling form for it, so I did that. One requirement states that I would have to work 4 years at a low income school, otherwise the grant would convert to a direct federal loan. On the other hand, the teacher loan forgiveness (TLF) program states that I would have to work 5 years at a low income school and could be forgiven around $17,500 since I would be teaching a ""high need"" subject. My question is, if I apply and accept the TEACH grant now would that make me ineligible for Teacher Loan Forgiveness later? Is it possible to do both? At what point would I apply for teacher loan forgiveness? Is that something I would apply for after completing the MS of education program? I'm not sure if I would work at a low income school as I don't know if there are any located reasonably close to me. I'm going to look more into that. If I do end up working for a low income school I might as well do it for 5 years instead of 4 so I can get a larger portion of my loan forgiven, right?

Also, what is your advice as far as repaying the loan? I want to do whatever will be most cost effective. I am only working part time right now but feel like I could comfortable put $1000 USD, maybe more every month towards my loans while in the program. Would this be wise? It could go towards the accrued interest, correct? Thank you for taking the time to read and respond. I appreciate all your input as I am completely naive to this process and fear being stuck with any unnecessary debt. Oh, I also don't have any other debt, I don't even have a credit card. I feel a little bit of anxiety to pay as much off as soon as I can. Would it be better to wait until after I complete the program to worry about paying it off?

personalfinance,Crippling debt and unable to refinance...,"I recently obtained my bachelor’s degree and employed full time but I am concerned about making my loan payments as well as covering the rest of my living expenses. Here is a breakdown of my situation:

Monthly expenses:
$510/mo for student loans ($200 low interest stafford loan and $310 high interest private loan). 
$65/mo auto insurance
$69/mo cell phone
$150/mo gas (commute to work and get ~35mpg)
$150/mo food
~$100/mo miscellaneous 

Income: 
Paid every other week ~$980 after deductions (medical/dental/vision, 401k @ 5%, taxes). Getting a raise soon where my income will change to about $1,150 after deductions. Each month I get between $120-300 in bonuses and can usually pick up overtime if I want to. 

Savings: 
$8,200 (got an insurance check for pain/suffering from a recent wreck) and I refuse to touch it unless I absolutely have to or should of it’s the right choice. 
$3,100 that I saved to covering moving expenses for when I find an apartment.
Checking account fluctuates but usually have $500 to cover my bills on autopay when they take out and different times of the month.

Problem:
I currently live with my parents and want to move out, but even after my raise I will be left with $1,420 for rent, utilities, internet, etc... and right now with my current income I’d only have $900 to pay my bills with and the raise won’t happen until March next year. 

Bottom line, I feel like I need to refinance my loans and get a lower interest rate but nobody will even consider me. My sister died my senior year and when I got depressed and dropped some classes and went to part-time my university automatically paid the tuition with a “Perkins loan” that I had no idea even existed until I checked my credit one day and noticed a 180 delinquency and 4 missed payments. My credit dropped from 780 to 540 (is now 630) but I’m considered high risk and have no idea when I can expect to qualify. This happened 8 months ago, I know the late payment will remain for 7 years but I don’t know what to expect with getting a higher score again. 

My car will probably need to be replaced but I’m in a financial situation where I’d be lucky if I can save enough to by one by then and am afraid even if I could get a high interest loan from a shady dealer due to my score/late payment that the payment would be too high for me to afford in addition to my loans... 

I guess what I am asking is... when will my credit score start to increase from when it initially dropped in January this year? Should I pay off some of the high interest private loans so I stop wasting money on interest and try to establish a savings again with what I’ll save? I’m so lost here...",finance

When I applied to college, I made the mistake of forgetting to send in my noncustodial CSS form to my college (I have divorced parents, the one I do not live with having passed away). The college said I was no longer eligible for any sort of scholarships outside of federal aid. I had the choice of going to this expensive but very good school or my much cheaper state school. I was going to choose the latter but my family convinced me to go to the expensive school, where I would be paying 75k a year because my job prospects would be much better- I understand however that this was 100% my decision, albeit a naive one.

personalfinance,"A rant about rates, from a mortgage professional. Tldr included.","I would like to start this post with the preface that it is in a certain light, a vent post. Just so you are aware, though I will try to make it as informative as possible. 

I work for a very large mortgage lender here in the US.
My particular position isn't that of a loan originator, though I have much of the same training and qualifications to be a loan originator. 
As such there may be others who can shed more light on this topic, and I encourage that. 

Everyday in my work I encounter at least three customers who would like to know what our interest rate is. 
They come in and ask something as simple as:
""What's your interest rate?"" or ""What's your rate for a 30 year fixed?"" 

Now, these may sound like good questions, but here's the thing. 
Every single mortgage is unique. Every single person is going to get a rate based on the situation that they find themselves in. 

When you are looking at rates on a mortgage lender's website they are called advertised rates. These advertised rates are going to be based on a variety of assumptions, such as:
A home value of $XXX, XXX
A down payment (or equity percentage in a refinance) of X%
A credit score of XXX
And other assumptions such as home location and presence of an escrow account. 

Many lenders will include discount points in their advertised rates to make them look nicer. (if you are unfamiliar with what discount points are, just think of it as a way to buy a lower interest rate at the closing time.) 
(Also if you are looking to get a mortgage and are unfamiliar with what discount points are, familiarize yourself with them) 

All of these factors go into a mortgage rate, and as such your own rate will most likely be quite different than the one advertised.

AGAIN: your own rate will most likely be quite different than the one advertised.

Sure, there is plenty of small script at the bottom of the rates page detailing this out, but no one seems to be able to read that. 

So when you are considering obtaining a mortgage and would like to know what the rates are, contact the mortgage company and ask for ""a competitive rate quote."" 

They most likely will need to speak with you on the phone, and that's fine, it's generally a fairly short phone call, where the agent will ask you about the home price you are considering and where the home is located, what you are planning for down payment, and a few questions about your credit profile. 

When receiving your rate quote, be sure to ask if is including discount points. If it is, ask what it would be without discount points, just so you can get an objective look at the situation. 

That's it! That's all there is to it.

Any other mortgage professionals who would like to throw in your two cents please feel free. 

And if you're considering obtaining a mortgage, don't come to me and ask what my company's rate is. There isn't one, there's just the one that we give you. 

Peace out Reddit!


TLDR
Mortgage rates are based on your situation. If you're shopping rates, call the mortgage company and ask for a competitive rate quote.",finance

personalfinance,In Law School &amp; Panicking,"Hi, everyone! I thought this would fit better here than in r/studentloans given that grad school works a bit differently. 

So this week, I received my loan disbursement refund for law school. However, my school failed to inform me until yesterday that my scholarship decreases the amount of federal loans I am eligible for. My loans are as follows for the academic year (yes, the year, not the semester. My semester loans would be these numbers halved): $20,282 in Federal Direct Unsubsidized and $19,930 in Federal Direct Grad PLUS. 

After my scholarship was applied and tuition was paid, I received $5863 to use for living expenses this semester, which comes to $1172 each month. And that's the massive, glaring issue. My bills (rent $750, phone $142, car and renter's insurance $219) total $1111, leaving just $61 for gas, groceries, books, incidentals, etc. I live with two roommates and I've tried to get my phone bill down with no success. My car is paid off and I'm in a rural area, so I need to keep that. 

That obviously is not going to work. So, what do I do? My program prohibits me from working, and there is no way I would have the time. I worked full-time through undergrad with no problem, but the law school curriculum is killing me. I feel that I need to have around $2000 per month to live comfortably and not be under constant stress, which would mean borrowing over $30,000 total in private loans to make that happen. 

Should I take out additional private loans to cover my living expenses, and what should I look for in a private loan servicer? I have $5000 in savings that I would like not to touch if at all possible. I have outstanding credit and no undergraduate loans or existing debt whatsoever. I have 3 cards with no balance and a combined credit limit of $14,500. I am also just worried about my debt in general. If I somehow avoided taking out more loans (and I don't see how that's possible) I would owe $108,062. My tuition will drop to the in-state rate next year, so this year is the most expensive.

All my investments are a 100% equity with most of it in broad market passive indexes. My 401k is with vanguard. Everything else is with Schwab where I use their low cost no commission funds. I'm in my early 30s. I'm the earner, married with a child on the way for situational context.

I have ~40% of my capital at this point in cash earning virtually nothing in my bank savings account. This is way past an emergency fund that will last me over a year easy.. maybe even 2 with no additional income.

I didn't invest that cash at first because I thought I might use a portion of it for a down payment on some real estate. But after a lot of reading/thinking I don't think I'm going to be buying any property in the near future (1-2 yrs or more ). Also, having the cash uninvested helped me psychology  to keep investing a good portion of my paycheck in the market because I knew if I lost a significant portion in a crash I won't be in the poor house.

Increasingly I feel silly holding this much cash earning nothing and worry about inflation. So I'm thinking of putting a portion of it in a high yield savings account like Ally (1.8%) or purepoint (1.9%). This would be ~11% of my total capital and ~30% of my cash. This would be my emergency fund.

The question is - what do I do with the remaining 70% of cash (~27 % of my total capital) ?

3 Considerations for this money are:
I don't want to invest into the equity markets today.

I want it to be fairly liquid so that I could invest into equity markets when we are in a bear market.

I may change my mind about buying some property in a year or 2. But I don't want to continue holding cash because there is just as much chance that I will not.

Should I keep this cash in the high yield savings account with my emergency fund?

Should I buy short term CDs( &lt;=1 year) instead? Which duration would you recommend and which would be the best place to buy them? I feel short term cds don't offer a significant benefit over the high yield savings while sacrificing liquidity (1.8 vs ~2%)

Should I put it in bond funds? If so which duration? and which fund? Again I'm with schwab. 

Why would you recommend one of these options over the other? Are there other options? 

With regard to bond funds I feel that they have the risk that interest rates might move up dropping the price of the capital at least the ones that hold longer durations would be more sensitive. With the shorter duration funds I feel the return is essentially holding cash and maybe in some ways worse s I could have my cash yield ~1.9%. Is the argument for bunds that in a stock market crash / recession the funds might actually go up in value and thereby offsetting some of the loss in equities? Would this offset be significant enough?

At the moment I'm leaning towards putting all the cash in the high yield savings. I know this is better than what it's doing now but I don't know if it's the wisest move.

Thanks for your help guys.",finance
financialindependence,"So, you want to be a landlord??","I'm an active member of this sub, but grabbed a new account to post this, as there's a few too many personal details. This was originally written for r/airforce, so it's from a military perspective, but I figured you guys would might like to read it, too. PCS/PCSing = permanent change of station, or when we move from one base to another. BAH = basic allowance for housing. 

TL;DR: Rental real estate is a pain, but can be very lucrative if done right. Here's a whole bunch of things you might need to consider.

EDIT: Alrighty, I'm wrong about depreciation. Depreciation is still a thing, still affects your personal income taxes, but I'm heading right back to google to correct my own information. Guys, I wrote this whole thing off the top of my head based on what I have personally learned, and I sincerely apologize, I don't mean to be handing out bad advice. Looks like I personally need to learn a whole bunch more about how depreciation recapture works. 

EDIT 2: The VA and FHA loans *can* be good options. However, YOU need to shop all of your options. Do not just assume that the VA is the best way to go. If it is the best option for you, go for it. If not, go with other financing. 

Edit 3: I'm pretty risk averse when it comes to over-leveraging. I'm never going to suggest that someone buy a house with nothing down, especially not while in the military and subject to a short notice relocation. If you do your own research and choose to buy with nothing down, that's on you. I'm still not comfortable with it. 

Alright... wall of text coming in. Take what you can and leave what's not useful. Everything written here is what I've personally learned. I'm not a realtor or a professional property manager, but have been a landlord for 6+ years and have learned a lot. Most of those lessons learned had huge price tags on them, too. I purchased my first home in 2011, our second in 2014, and our third just last year. The first two are rented out. Not everything will apply to you, but here's what I've learned along the way. Topics are written in the order that I thought of them, my apologies if it's not 100% cohesive. As of right now, I have awesome tenants in both properties, but that hasn't always been the case. My approach to real estate is to 1, protect my own investment and 2, to provide a good home to my tenants. I've made some more generous financial decisions to both of those extents, and while those decisions cut into my profits a bit, I have no regrets. 

**Purchasing your first home**

**Should I rent or purchase?**

Don't over buy on your first purchase.

I say again, don't over buy.

If the market is white hot, it's going to cool off. And you don't want to be holding the chips when that happens. You really don't have the time to sit on the house and let it recover, unless you've got money somewhere you're not talking about. 2008 took about 10 years to fully recover from and to gain back the lost appreciation (most markets, at least) and you don't have 10 years. ​ If you do a zero down VA loan and roll the closing costs into the loan, it takes, on average, the first 18 months just to pay off the closing costs. Takes about 3 more years to get down to a break-even point with seller's closing costs included, and about 5 years before you'll make money. Yes, it seems like a lot of BAH to be ""throwing away"", but look at the actual makeup of a newly amortized mortgage - most of your payment is going towards things other than principle.

If you bring a down payment to the table, you've mitigated that part of your risk, but you're still exposed to lose money at the sale of the house. You've still got your purchase closing costs, which, on a $190k house are probably between $6000 and $9000, depending on your financing. Most of that is money that just evaporates.

If you can rent for LESS than the interest/insurance/taxes part of the payment and just dump the principal part into savings/mutual funds/TSP/IRA, you'll come out ahead. Granted, that normally means renting a smaller apartment instead of living in a nice house, but it's the sacrifice we make to be financially responsible.

Money in real estate is made 3 ways:

1, getting a good deal on the purchase.

2, holding the property for forever and getting the appreciation.

3, renting it out and making a profit off of someone else.

Normally, you want a good mix of all 3. The first takes PATIENCE when you're looking to purchase, and from what you've told me, a good deal just isn't available to purchase in Vegas right now. Strike one. Are you going to live in it long enough to ride out the bubble you see and make money when you sell? Meh, maybe not. Strike two. Do you want to landlord? If you've thought about it, scroll up and re-read again. If you're still on board, then its a consideration ​

Renting is buying patience. Seems like in your area, patience is what you need. There's always a house to buy in the future.

Rents do rise and fall, but they don't rise and fall nearly as fast as real estate does in a white-hot market. Hence the 1% per month rental price as an approximation. If there's a $200,000 house that's renting for $1500 a month, and the house next door sells for $220,000, the first house likely went up 10% in value. However, your landlord isn't going to jack your rent 10% in the middle of the lease just because Zillow thinks his house is now worth what the one next door sold for. If you rent, you're protected from the competitive spikes in purchasing, and are more exposed to the long-term appreciation of pricing. Your landlord's costs of ownership are fixed (unless he's on an interest only loan, and then he's stupid), so he can offer you rent at a fixed or gradually increasing rate. He's not trying to compete with other buyers to purchase a first home like you are. 

**VA Loan**

The VA loan... not my favorite topic. First off, you're almost always better off going with conventional financing if you've got a down payment, and no one should ever purchase a home if they don't have one. The VA loan brags about not having PMI, but the funding fee is essentially pre-paid PMI. On a conventional loan, you can request that PMI be removed once you hit 78% LTV, but there's no option to un-do the prepayment of the funding fee. 

The first time the VA loan is used, the funding fee is 2.15% of the loan. After that, it's 3.3% of the loan unless the borrower brings 5% down. (https://www.veteransunited.com/education/library/va-funding-fee/)

The max amount of loan that the VA will insure is $453,000. You can have more than one VA loan at a time, but the two can NOT total more than that amount. With the median home price today, you're likely going to be going with conventional financing on the next house, anyway. The other option is to refinance the soon to be rental with conventional financing and re-use the VA entitlement on the new purchase, but again, I tend to shy away from VA loans all together. 

When I purchased my last home, my loan officer just assumed that I'd go with VA financing. I asked her to pull a quote for conventional and give me the break-even point. She didn't want to, but I made her do it anyway. She was shocked that, wow, I was right about my financing options. Not to brag, but she's used to checking boxes on paperwork, while I'm used to scrimping to make that precious SSgt pay last as far as possible.

**I'm buying near a military base, it's a good market, right?**

Ah, but buying close to base is BAD for appreciation. Because of the high turnover of military personal, there's always someone trying to sell their house. Always a lot of people, actually. This leads to high inventory and low demand. When there's high inventory, people start dropping prices to sell faster. You've seen the opposite right now in Vegas - low inventory and high demand cause a price spike. Same math, different side of the equation. 

With values depressed because of high inventory, sellers in a heavily military area will likely sell for their break-even point. If sales prices don't go up, neither does value. Neither does rents, and so BAH remains flat. BAH remains flat, and the next guy can't afford to buy your house for any more than you bought it for. It's a vicious cycle and it's common near bases. In this equation, the only people making any money are the real estate agents who have an unlimited supply of customers. 

The plus side is that you can usually get a lot of house for the money near a base. The only real way to break that cycle is to have an outside economic influence bleeding off the extra inventory. This happens when a small(ish) base is located in an area with other good paying jobs. If the only places to work in a 20 minute radius are the base and retail, tread carefully. 

**Working with a realtor**

Realtors are real estate professionals, and I always recommend a first time buyer work with a good agent. However, keep in mind that the realtor has a vested interest in you purchasing just as much home as you can. Same thing with the bank, they WANT you to borrow as much as they can reasonably let you have. Most people will make a decision about choosing a realtor based on personality and how well they ""jive"" with the person, but that's the wrong answer. You want someone who no-kidding knows the local market and who can educate you. 

It's like working with a military recruiter. It's their JOB to put you in the military and that's the direction they're going to steer you. And of course the recruiter is gonna tell you all the awesome things about the military - they've reenlisted and stuck around a while. Doesn't mean it's for every applicant, and it's still the applicant's job to do their own research. Same thing with the realtor. 

Anyone can show you homes and point out how awesome a kitchen is. Anyone can give you a listing from the MLS. That's not what you want. You need someone who can no kidding educate you and be your advocate. 

Now you're faced with the decision to sell or rent after your PCS. Here's some thoughts:

**Selling expenses**

Look at your HUD/Closing statement from when you purchased the house, but look at the seller's side of the page. Assuming you sell the house for a similar amount as you purchased (within 10% or so), you can assume that selling closing costs will also be within about 10% of those listed on the closing statement. Normally, you can assume that 10-15% of the value of the sale will be eaten up in closing costs and realtor fees. This could vary based on the terms of your sales contract, but most buyers push the seller to pay as much as possible. So, if your home is worth $200,000, you can expect to take home $170,000 - $180,000 after closing costs. If you owe more than that, then YOU will have to write a check to the bank for the difference at closing. It you owed $185,000 on the $200,000 home, and your net was $180,000, then you pay the bank the extra $5000 to close. Decide if it's worth it to ""feed"" the home (more details later) month to month as a rental or if it's better to take the lump sum hit now. If you rolled your purchase closing costs into the loan, did a zero-down VA, or have not owned the home very long, look at the numbers closely. The home may have appreciated enough to cover everything, it may not have.

**Fair rental value**

Industry standard is 1% of the property's value each month as rent. This should (should) give you a pre-expense rate of return of 12% on your money before appreciation. However, that estimate is not accurate in every market. Work with your realtor or property manager to figure out a good price point to start at. I started a little bit high, then negotiated down to my bottom line. Price too high and you won't attract a tenant. Price too low and you'll attract the wrong kind of tenant. Factor in your own expenses, but if your expenses are high, you may have to ""feed"" the property (more on that later). Find out what houses near you are currently renting for, and get a good guestimate for what you could get for your home. Factor in any perks - like if the washer/dryer are included, if there's a pool, if you allow pets, etc. 

1% monthly works, sorta. In a high-rental but low-ownership neighborhood, rents may be more like 1.5% of the sale-able value. In a high value neighborhood, you're likely not going to get quite 1% as anyone who can afford $5000 a month rent on a half million dollar home will just buy the thing themselves.

**Rental expenses**

Here's what you need to factor in when estimating your monthly expenses:
 Mortgage payment
 Property tax increase (more below)
 Landlord's insurance (more below)
 Vacancies
 Turnover cost
 Repairs
 HOA fees
 Extras like lawn care or pool maintenance 

**Vacancies**

Industry standard is 8-10% time vacant, or about one month a year. Factor this into the price of your rent to maintain year-round profitability. You may have a year with 20% vacancy, and then your next tenant stays for 4 years. No telling what will happen. 1 vacant month each year is a generic estimate. 

**Turnover cost**

Regardless of how awesome your tenants are, there's going to be standard wear and tear on your property. Each turnover will require a deep clean New carpet and new paint will be required every 3-5 years, more often with kids/pets/smokers. If you're not physically able to do this work, you'll be paying out-of-pocket for a contractor to do this work, and it adds up fast (mine was $40 an hour). The longer this work takes, the longer your property is empty, and it's hard to show a house that's not in good condition. Some of the more egregious turnover problems can be taken out of the security deposit, but that could also be contested by the departing tenant. 

**Utilities during turnover**

The property owner is responsible for turning on the utilities while the home is vacant. It's very difficult to do turnover repairs without water or electricity, and almost impossible to show a home without electricity. Usually a phone call to the local utility company to re-open the utilities in your name is all it takes, but the utility company may require you leave a deposit with them. This is something your property manager can take care of for you if you're no longer in the local area. Factor this into your cost of turnover. 

**Repairs**

Industry standard is about 10% of the rent set aside for repairs - this number combines turnover repairs AND the day-to-day issues. This could vary widely, based on the condition of the home, price of the rent, standard of tenant, etc. The more expensive rent price attracts a more financially responsible tenant, who will either take better care of the home or be pickier about you repairing every little thing. Finding a responsible tenant who treats the property well and who does the little things themselves (I had a tenant who thought I owed him lightbulbs) will go a long way. 

**Listing fees**

The typical realtor who's listing your property for rent will take half the first month's rent as the listing fee. Half of that remains with the listing agent, and half goes to the tenant's agent. Factor this into your price of rent. Half the first month's rent, paid once a year (estimate, with 1-year leases turning over once a year), is about 4% of the annual rent cost. This is normally in addition to monthly management fees. 

**Management fees**

Usually 10% of the monthly rent in addition to the listing fees. Make sure you're getting your money's worth with this. If you've got a good tenant and can manage repair issues long-distance, you may only need to pay for listing fees. However, that leaves your property without an eyes-on look from someone other than a tenant, and that's not wise. Either way, find a good handyman in the area and keep them on speed dial. 

**HOAs**

Read your HOA docs and find out exactly what you need to do to rent the property. Your HOA may require board approval of your tenant. Get that process started early. If there's strict lawn care or other appearance standards, it may be beneficial to hire a lawn care company and just include it in the price of the rent. Be sure to list HOA standards in your rental contract and leave the tenant responsible for adhering to them. HOA fees are normally included in the rent so that you guarantee that they're paid. 

In a condo situation, FHA financing regulations require a certain percentage of the complex to be owner-occupied or the complex will not be eligible for typical financing. Without the ability to get FHA financing, the units will be less sell-able, and therefore will drop in value. In an effort to preserve the sale-ability and value of the entire complex, condo HOAs will deny requests to turn an owner-occupied unit into a rental IF the complex is close to that percentage. When purchasing a condo with the intent to rent in the future, ask the HOA about this. HOAs are also responsible for the maintenance of the parking lot, exterior structure, etc, and if the finances are poorly managed, it could result in an assessment against each unit. This is yet another financial contingency you must be ready for. 

In a typical single family home neighborhood, the management of the HOA can still make-or-break the rental situation. Do your research and talk to the board. 

**Pool**

A pool is easily $40,000+ worth of value in the home, and it's likely to your financial advantage to properly maintain it. Tenants may or may not care for it the way you would, you have to make the risk management decision. Consider hiring a pool maintenance company and include it in the price of the rent. One less thing for the tenant to worry about, and you've got the asset covered. Similar consideration should be made to AC system maintenance - just have the AC guy come once a year for a tune-up and add it to the pile of expenses. 

**Pets**

Your call on pets. Once pets live in the house, it's going to be hard to rent to non-pet owners unless you replace all the carpet. Pets can also kill the lawn and/or landscaping. I personally have pets and have had my own pets in my homes, so I've allowed my tenants to also have pets. You can attract a tenant who's willing to pay a bit more to have a good house with a good yard for their dogs. I always charge a non-refundable pet deposit, usually $250. That money will go towards cleaning or replacing the carpets or other damages directly from the pets. 

**Landlord's insurance**

You will need a new insurance policy on the property. A typical homeowners policy covers the home AND the contents, whereas a landlord's policy covers just the home. As the landlord's policy covers less, it's generally cheaper than the homeowners policy. However, if you had any challenges underwriting your home (pool, trampoline, closeness to the water, unpermitted work, etc) you'll have those same challenges underwriting a landlord's policy. 

**Property taxes**

Many states have a homestead exemption for a first home that's occupied by the owner. Once you rent out your home, you will lose the homestead exemption the following tax year. You will have an escrow deficiency that year (make it up in cash) and then a higher payment after that year's escrow analysis. Homestead exemption is typically $50,000 off the assessed value, so you can guestimate by adding that much to your value and then figuring out what the new taxes should be. For my house, it's about $1100 extra a year, or just shy of $100 a month. Make sure you include this in your rent pricing, and do careful research into the property tax laws of your county. 

**Cash flow break-even rent pricing**

Mortgage payment (including increased property taxes) , +10% management fee,
 +4% annual turnover,
 +10% expected repairs,
 +8% vacancy,
 +HOA fees,
 + extras (pool, lawn).
 I'm not factoring in pool or lawn expenses, as those are usually considered perks and added in afterwards. 

With a property manager: payment + 32%. Without a property manager: payment + 22%. Without a property manager and self-listing: payment + 18%

Now, take that number, and compare it to the typical market rents of houses near you. Can you cover your expenses? Break even? Come out ahead? Will you have to ""feed"" your home? If so, how much? 

**Feeding the home**

Feeding the home is when you're spending more in expenses monthly/yearly than you're making in rent. Sometimes this is due to a catastrophic repair event, sometimes this is due to market fluctuation. Sometimes this is due to over-leveraging in your financing (zero down loan) and a high interest cost. Whatever the reason, you need to make a risk calculation to decide to continue feeding the property extra money or to just cut your losses and sell the house. Here's a few ways to look at it. 

First, calculate your expected net loss at closing if you were to sell the property. Next, calculate how much you'd have to ""feed"" it monthly. Compare the two and find out your break even point. If you're looking at a $5,000 loss at closing, but only feeding the house $200 a month, your break even point is 25 months, or 2 years. In that 2 years, your property values can go up, your cost of ownership can go down (mostly your monthly interest cost), and market rents may increase. So, 2 years from now, calculate if it's worth it to continue keeping the property and move on from there. If you're feeding it $100 a month in contrast to a potential $20,000 loss, feeding it is likely the way to go. If you're feeding it $500 monthly while looking at a $2000 closing loss, you're probably better off to just sell it and move on. 

As you pay down the house, your equity increases and the cost of ownership decreases. Your return rates will therefore increase. If your monthly mortgage pay-off amount is around $450, but your feeding the house $200, your cash flow will show that you're losing $200 monthly, but your network has an overall gain of $250 monthly. This can be a fantastic long-term strategy, if you've got the finances and budget to sustain it in the short term. 

Catastrophic repair events happen, too, but these can increase the value of the property. For example, a new AC system may be $7000, but you'll get that money back when you sell it. Its a factor in planning, but not really a month to month expense. More on that later. 

Granted, all of these numbers are looked at before the emotional factor of personal finance is considered. If it's worth it to you to spend $200 a month to keep your dream home for 2 more years until retirement, then that's an emotional decision. A perfectly reasonable one to make, if that's what you want to do. Just factor everything in together when looking at the big picture. 

**Tenant screening**

Obviously, selecting good tenants is key to maintaining a good rental relationship. I had tenants who ended up growing pot in my house and cost me a significant amount of money. Renting to military families is also hit or miss, I've had fantastic military families in my homes and challenging military families in my homes. Even if you list the property yourself, run a full background check and look at their financial ability to pay you. I don't pay too much attention to their credit score (unless there's a glaring problem), but do look at their ability to PAY their rent on time. 

**Managing the tenant relationship**

There's another person living in my largest financial asset. I try my best to be open and accessible, without getting too buddy-buddy. If there's an issue with the house that falls on the landlord's responsiblity, I've tried to err on the side of the tenant. For example, the month that my tenants had to heat their house with their stove while we installed a replacement HVAC system, I covered their natural gas bill. With good tenants, the good will generally pays off quite well. 

**Income Taxes**

You will pay income taxes on your rental profit. That's after deducting your expenses. Rental property expenses are not deducted in the same way as your primary mortgage interest - that's the difference between taking the standard deduction and itemizing. I normally take the standard deduction, as I don't have personal expenses worth itemizing. However, your rental property is treated like a small business and rental expenses will count against your rental income to get the bottom line.

The following expenses are deductible: Insurance, interest, property taxes, utilities, listing fees, management fees, HOA fees, repairs. You can also take depreciation (more later on that.) Upgrades and capital improvements are not deductible, but can be straight-line depreciated (I've never done this myself.) If, say, the roof goes bad and you spend $10,000 on a new roof, that's deductible. If you ADD on a deck, that's considered an improvement. 

The main out-of-pocket expense that you can't deduct is the principle part of your mortgage payment, as that's not an actual expense. That money still go towards increasing your net worth by increasing your equity in the property. 

I do my own taxes every year with the $79.99 version of TurboTax and a few hours worth of research. Good record keeping during the year is essential, especially when adding up all of those Lowes receipts for repairs. 

**Depreciation**

Oh, boy... Depreciation is the idea that an asset has a limited lifespan, and after a certain amount of time, the asset will be worth zero. The IRS allows you to take a fraction of that every year, and consider it an expense against your income. (https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/060815/how-rental-property-depreciation-works.asp) Taking depreciation will reduce your income taxes, however, you will pay capital gains taxes on the depreciated amount when you go to sell the property. 

With long term capital gains set at 15% (for most people), chances are that you're better off taking the depreciation if your current marginal (not effective) tax rate is above 15%. There's no telling what tax rates will do in the future, though. If/when you sell the property, hopefully you'll have the cash available to pay the taxes at that time. 

Depreciation can be compared to the tax advantages of a retirement account. It's is more like the Traditional instead of the Roth, where you take the tax break now but pay for it later. 

When you sell the property (either because you wanted to or because you're dead and the estate is selling it), the capital gains taxes are paid as follows: Net of sale (market rate minus selling expenses), minus original purchase price, plus depreciation taken. 

If the house purchased for $100,000, depreciation will be around $3000 a year. Letssay, 4 years in, you've depreciated the house by $12,000. Your basis in the home is now $88,000, NOT the original $100,000. You sell it for $150,000, net $127,500 (15% of $150,000). $127,500 - $88,000 = taxable gains of $39,500 x 15% = taxes of $5925. Without depreciation, the taxable gains would have been $27,500 and taxes of $3300.

**The emotional factor of landlording**

My husband and I rented out our first home after we upgraded to a larger one. A few months later, he was at the home fixing a minor issue and saw how our tenant was taking care of the property. The place was dirty, smelled bad, and overall not well kept (bad tenant screening on my end). This was OUR home, the home we brought out daughter home from the hospital to, the home that we shared our wedding night in. Seeing it treated poorly by a stranger was a punch in the gut. No amount of money was worth seeing our memories misstreated like that. 

Or is it? You're going to have to decide what your emotional investment into the property is and if you can allow it to become someone else's home. This isn't a financial decision as much as it is a personal one. The personal influence can cause you to make a less than optimal financial decision concerning the property, so just keep that awareness as you make those critical decisions. 

**Internal financial management**

Per most states' state law, rental security deposits must not be commingled with other monies. I keep a separate savings account with the security deposit and just don't touch it. Any interest that the deposit accrues is owed back to the tenant at the time that they move out. 

I have a separate checking account for my property. Rents are paid in, expenses paid out. That way, everything is in ONE location and it's easy to figure out exactly what our profit/loss is. If you're managing a property locally, get a debit card on that account for Lowes purchases. I also keep a savings account for each property for escrow and repairs. (one property is paid for, so I maintain a manual escrow account, the other is a straight emergency fund.) 

I structure my personal budget to pay my mortgages and rental expenses out of our base pay, and then use the rents to put money into retirement, savings, and my daughter's college fund. That way, if (when) there's a vacancy or a problem, I'm not coming out in the red during those months. We can at least cover our expenses on our base pay, even if there's a month or two where we don't quite get to retirement contributions. 

In addition to emergency funds set aside directly for the property, make sure you can handle the one-off catastrophic emergency. 

**Catastrophic emergency**

Last year, I lost $22,000 in rental real estate, between rehabbing my first home, fixing up the second, recovering from crappy tenants in the second, and worse. The city hit my sewer main, said it was my fault, and I was out $10,000 in a single month. 3 years ago, the heater in my first house went out in December, and I wrote a check for $7000. I currently have $16,000 invested in 3 different sewer main re-builds under two different houses. (never, EVER again buying anything with cast iron pipes.) These things happen, and we dealt with all of this on SSgt pay. Thankfully, most of those losses have been made up over the next 1-2 years' worth of rent, but you NEED to have the cash on hand to be able to cover these types of emergencies. Good credit is also helpful - I had to borrow $10,000 once to cover turnover and repairs, but ended up coming out on top in the end. Ultimately, your rental property is likely a significant chunk of your net worth, and while it may hurt to spend ten grand on a repair issue, that's only 5% of the value of a $200,000 home. Not worth losing a whole asset over 5%. 

**The hassle factor**

Landlording is not easy. Dealing with people, finances, local real estate markets, construction type repairs, etc. It's a package deal. Some months I spend 30 minutes on it and make a decent amount of money. Some months it's 30 hours a week and I lose money. Overall, I've done pretty well, but it's the law of averages. 

Purchasing the next home with a rental

SOOOO... you're on the brink, ready to rent out your current house and go buy another one. Here's some things to think about: 

**Financing considerations**

So, you've PCSed and now want to buy a new house at your next duty station. That's great, now you need to convince a loan officer to give you another mortgage for another property.

First, you're going to have to be able to afford a second mortgage with your current debt to income ratio. If your rental mortgage is all the debt you have, you're probably in a good spot. Add in some vehicle or student loan debt, and now it doesnt look too good. 

You can use you rental income to compensate for the rental mortgage, but the bank will want to see 2 years tax returns with the income. Depending on when you converted it to a rental and what time a year you want to buy, 2 years tax returns can take closer to parts of 4 years to document. 

**Purchase conservatively**

The bank will do all they can to max out your DTI (debt to income ratio) to earn just as much interest off of you as they can. By choosing a smaller/cheaper home for your initial or second purchases, you can reign in the budget. Think of who you're going to rent to when you PCS, and make sure you can afford to rent within BAH rates. Just because the bank says you can borrow a half million dollars on a mortgage doesn't mean you should. And if you do, you will have zero room to finance the next property. Scroll back to the top where we talked about not over-buying. 

**Leverage ratios**

Alright, heading into the weeds here... The more you've borrowed against a property, the higher the leverage ratio. This isn't generally a problem if you're living in your own home and plan to remain there for quite some time, but it does become a factor when the bank starts looking at your suitability for the next purchase. (https://www.thebalancesmb.com/top-don-ts-in-using-real-estate-leverage-2867098) 

If you owe $90,000 on a home worth $100,000, your leverage ratio is .90, that's very high. If you owe $90,000 on a home worth $400,000, your leverage ratio is now 0.225. That's very conservative. With the same debt to income ratio, the real estate owner with the lower leverage ratio is going to be a much safer customer to the bank. You can better your leverage ratios by 1, paying down the house or 2, letting it appreciate. The first is within your control, the second is not. 

**Interest expense**

The single greatest expense in the first year of home ownership is the purchaser's closing costs. Beyond the first year, the greatest expense on a financed property (barring an enormous catastrophic event) is the interest expense. The lower your interest expense, the higher your profit. You can lower your interest expense by 1, getting a better rate and 2, borrowing less. You can borrow less by either putting more down on the home, or by paying it down early. 

**Paying off a house early**

So, this one is highly controversial in the landlord business. Some folks will say to borrow as much as possible against a rental property because the interest is completely tax deductible and you can leverage your cash to purchase multiple properties. It's also possible (some years) to make a better rate of return in the stock market. While both of these schools of thought have validity, it's overlooking the factor of RISK. I've personally paid off a rental property and it was one of the greatest feelings in the world. Sure, I'm not making quite as much on that money as I could, but the risk on a paid for property is much lower than with a financed property. It also doesn't count towards my DTI any more, and isn't much of a hassle factor in future property financing decisions. At a minimum, paying off the house will give you a return equal to the interest rate, minus the marginal taxes you would have paid if you had taken the deduction. However, if you achieved a greater rate of return elsewhere, you'd also owe taxes on that, at either capital gains rates or your personal marginal tax rate. 

If your goal is to churn and burn and just buy as many properties as possible, you're likely going to finance all of them as much as you can. If your goal is to retire from the military with one or two investment properties, then work towards paying them off at a reasonable rate. 

**Conventional VS creative financing**

Creative financing is an option, but not one that most of us use. This would be something like, say, getting a loan from your uncle's IRA to buy the house, and then you pay your uncle the interest. This is do-able if you've got rich friends/family who are willing to invest in your mortgage. However, loans like this require much more documentation when you're looking at the next deal. Because banks are used to dealing with conforming loans (the fancy term for loans that fit all the rules), they may balk at a lender with a creatively financed asset in their portfolio. You'll have a greater burden of paperwork and proof to demonstrate your continued creditworthiness. 

**Rental VS Owner occupied financing**

You can borrow money to purchase a rental, but the interest rates are usually a full or two full percentage points higher. On $100,000 borrowed, each full interest rate percentage is $1000 a year or $83 a month. Obviously, that amortizes, but that's the starting expense at month 1. 

**Refinancing a rental as a rental**

Once the home is no longer owner occupied, it doesn't fit the criteria for owner occupied financing. A re-finance at that point (to pull cash out, clear the VA entitlement, or re-structure of payments) will likely cost that $83 per month per $100,000 borrowed. If you live in a home that will be a rental and you need to update your financing, do it before you move out. 

**Larger down payment**

You can always entice a bank with a larger down payment. The more money you put down on the next deal, the lower their risk is. Borrowing less also raises your DTI by a smaller amount, and that can help get you approved. Coming up with a larger down payment while turning your current property AND PCSing can be challenging, so plan ahead. 

Here's another thing to think about with the down payment: Your down payment is your buffer between you and the real estate market fluctuating. If you have 5% equity in your house, and the market drops by 5%, you're basically imobile. If you have 25% equity and the market drops 5%, you're still down by that much of your net worth, but the remaining 20% equity gives you the ability to cover closing costs if you choose to sell, cover a dip in rents, etc. Better to lose money you have than money you don't. 

Let me say that again - Better to lose money you have, than money you don't.

**Balanced portfolio**

Guys, rental real estate isn't the whole thing. For the average homeowner, our home makes up the largest asset in our portfolio. If the house is paid for, it's probably the most significant portion of our net worth. As soon as it's rented, you now have one single asset worth a LOT of money, and all of your net worth is in the same asset class. 

Don't forget to contribute to retirement through tax advantaged accounts (IRAs, TSP, 401Ks, etc). There's been seasons in our life where we had to stop retirement contributions to get over a hump, but that should be the exception, not the norm. Do your own research if your rental property income changes the equation for you while deciding between Roth and Traditional contributions, but chances are, it shouldn't make that big of a difference. 

**Liquidity**

This is a problem, too. $100,000 worth of home may be worth $100,000, but it's very difficult to convert a house that another family is living in, into cash. Borrowing against the property is an option, but only if your DTI can support it. Selling the property, at a minimum, will take 60 days. Maintain the amount of liquidity in your overall net worth (mine is in my emergency fund) to balance the amount that's non-liquid. Your personal liquidity needs are dependent on your financial situation and your risk tolerance, but it is a factor to consider.

personalfinance,How would you reblanace my assets?,"Never visited this subreddit before, I hope that this is the correct forum to post this. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have previously been saving an OK amount of money but have always enjoyed what I wanted in combination of moving money on and off the stock market. This has lead me to not really have 100% track of how I ""develop"" financially wise.

I have for the last 6 months been keeping track on my ""total worth"" and how it moves up and down but thought that it could be good to give some insight into my situation:

I am 30 years old, 4 years out of university, and live in a Scandinavia where housing and other things are traditionally expensive but never spend a dime on healthcare and other related things. I studied abroad for some time so I have about $20k in student debt that I pay $100 for each month with a very low interest rate.

I own an apartment together with my girlfriend that we bought for $550K (which was considered a very good deal for the area) and she works at a bank which gives us a very good interest rate on mortgage, I don't have the exact number but I think we pay somewhere in the neighborhood of 0.7% interest rate on that loan.

My salary is about $90K per year, which is not really high with US standards, but in our country it is apparently in the 1% for my age. I know, I sound like a huge asshole, but I thought it could be worth mention to give you an idea.

Since I have two loans with low interest rate, the amount of money I have left per month after all expenses paid are about $3 600. For the last two years I have saved an average of $1750 per month. I don't think I can have this high of an average going forward since I used to have work engagements abroad and had a lot of living expenses paid for during this period.

**My assets are:**

* **Apartment**: $47 500 (the amount I put down as down-payment and I pay down the loan with about $400 each month)
* **Stocks**: $16 000 (diversified with 67% stable investment companies and 33% quite high risk tech companies)
* **Savings** (**cash**): $30 500 (no interest rate)

So my question is, how would you re-arrange? I am quite annoyed that such a large portion of my assets are on a savings account with no interest rate, then at the same time since my mortgage interest rate is so low I don't feel the need to pay more on the loan really... and then we have the stock market that has hit all time records for the last 10 days.

With a long investment horizon, I should not care to put the money on the stock market even if it is at an all time high, but I still feel somewhat reluctant to do it.

personalfinance,I just refinanced my student loans but got a better offer in the mail.,"Hello reddit! So here’s my story. I graduated last year and shortly after started paying off student loans. After waiting 6 months, per advice of my parents, I began the refinancing process. In the process, I refinanced roughly $57,000 Sallie Mae loans through MEFA and went from having interest rates of 7%-12% to having one fixed rate of 6.5%.
Yesterday, I got a letter in the mail from LendKey saying that I was pre-approved for a particular amount. I was going to just skim the letter and trash it, I get pre-approval letters a lot for various things, but as I was skimming the letter I saw that the interest rates they had written were lower than 6.5% (even in the fine print). 
So now my question is, first off, can I refinance refinanced loans? And if I can, should I do it? My biggest driver for consideration is the potential interest savings. I have not yet looked to see what fees are associated with LendKey and haven’t yet looked to see if MEFA has a penalty for paying off loans early. But it’s a nagging thought in my mind that if I don’t find out more about this I could lose an opportunity to save money. Thoughts?",finance

personalfinance,"38, no savings or retirement, high income help!","I've made a series of horrible decisions over the years, and at 38 I'm ready to finally start making good ones. Stats:

* $20k credit debt, decent interest rate, should be paid off within a year.
* $0 in savings, 401k, or investments
* $190k/yr base salary, \~$40-50k/yr bonus and additional income
* Own a home, two kids near college age

My first plan is to invest to max in my 401k. My company doesn't offer matching but it seems to be a low cost way of kickstarting things due to the tax savings. I don't qualify for IRAs. My account offers a ton of different funds that I have no idea how to choose from, so I was considering JPM SMRTRET 2045 R5 (JSAIX) for the set and forget factor. Alternatively, they offer FID 500 INDEX PR (FUSVX) which AFAIK is aggressive but possibly good since I have nothing right now. I took a screenshot of all the possibilities here: [https://imgur.com/a/rnO5Zjr](https://imgur.com/a/rnO5Zjr)

By this time next year I'd like to be maxing the 401k and contributing an additional \~$1,500/mo to some other kind of investment, though I'm not sure what that would be.

personalfinance,Make sure to take a look at your pay withholding in the next month,"As we get close to the 4th quarter of the year, my inner tax nerd could not help but recommend that everyone take a look at their federal withholding on their paystubs YTD. Most people claim an allowance of 0 or 1, which most of the time (not always, I know two jobs or married couples can be different) ends up over withholding their federal tax liability by the end of the year, leading to bigger than needed refunds. No one wants to give the Treasury Department an interest free loan right?

What I recommend is taking a look at your YTD statement, ADP and Paychex has the ability to show this, seeing what has been withheld so far, what you expect to make, and throwing the numbers and other miscellaneous info into a tax projector/calculator. The IRS has their own which will tell you the amount of allowances they think will be best for you. See here:

https://www.irs.gov/individuals/irs-withholding-calculator


Then put that amount of recommended allowances on a new W-4 and send to your employer. They should update your pay within the month and you’ll have a lower federal payment and a higher take home amount! 

Some other pieces of information:

-	This obviously only works if you so far have been withholding more than needed. Sometimes you may actually have to increase your withholding amount (lowering allowances). But this is still good to do regularly so you don’t come in underpaid come April. 
-	IMPORTANT! Make sure you update your W-4 back to a reasonable amount in the beginning of 2019. If you keep your allowances high (say above 5-10+ or so) and forget about it, you’ll more likely than not come in underpaid for the following year. 
-	Make sure you also account for any additional income or deduction/credit amounts. Dividends, interest, capital gains, Sch C business income, rental income, partnership income, etc etc will require you to need more paid in. Don’t forget any income when doing this calculation.",finance

I have taken tons of advice from here from Car insurance to our student loan debt and consolidating finances, but I think what keeps me up at night is our investing and retirement planning.

* 5k CC debt: (No APR until October so i am paying $1k each pay cycle to knock this out quickly - came mostly from engagement ring, I know ^^dont ^^kill ^^me!)
* Join Savings Acc: $10k in a ""high interest savings""
* 44k in retirement fund: 6k roth, 38k in 401k and I have a 529 plan opened with $200
 * Currently funding 401k at $484/mo (Employer will match 6% starting in November) | Usually won't add to my ROTH until Tax season rolls around :/ 
 * $840/mo into our Savings each month

Fiance:

* 56k salary 
 * Public service position and currently in IBR for PSLF 10 years 
 *  150k student debt: (100k federal, 55k in private loans, 40k of which was consolidated at 4%)
* Retirement is in a pension fund I am not too sure of

* Car Insurance: $89/mo
* My car payment: $300/mo - $8k left at 3%
* Utilities Phone/Tv/Internet/Power): ~$230/mo
* Food: $300/mo

Honestly, I'm frustrated with the whole process since I don't have a degree and I'm paying 16% of my personal take home pay to these.

I had my lender run the numbers and if I go 5% with a theoretical 1/8 point hike it would come to the same monthly payment less $56.00 a month as the FHA %3.5 right now. If it goes up twice it obviously will be more expensive to go conventional. 

This is going to blow away all my savings and raise my monthly costs by about $600.00 as I have a very reasonable housing cost currently.

I am looking for all you personal finance redditers to show me what I am forgetting to think about. Also before you all tear into me for not having retirement started I am aware of how bad it is and I am actively working towards fixing the issue. The only reason I am thinking of forcing this purchase to go through is that I have a limited time period to take advantage of the under market value purchase price.",finance

personalfinance,How to keep financial plan on track after unexpected loss(es)?,"Earlier this year I was fired from a terrible job. Sadly, I thought it was my dream job &amp; would move me forward in my career, but mngmt was horrible/nonexistent, everyone was set up to either fail or throw whoever they worked with under the bus, and I should’ve left the place months before (the primary tip I got from a professional career coach I saw while I worked there was “Exit Strategy!” )

The job definitely eroded my professional confidence. I had a direct manager who was  explosively angry if I made a mistake, but just as often complained I was too slow or bad at my job if I asked for too much direction or couldn’t figure out some inexplicable task. BUT I fooled myself into thinking things had improved and then was suddenly fired after taking a week off for a death in the family (by the senior manager who 3 wks prior told me how great of a team player I was and how invested she was in having me there because they needed more people like me in the company).

I pulled myself together and found a contract gig with a small company a within a few weeks, but this did eat into the bit of savings my spouse and I had started building. We also put our plans to tackle paying off debt on hold  since my paycheck from the new job isn’t regular (the date &amp; amount we get paid varies based on the length of the project assigned). AND our 2017 taxes ended up being 4xs more than expected so there’s a bit of additional stress (Federal’s on a payment plan, but state has to be paid off in the next 3 mos).

After my last job being so bad, I’ve been guarded but cautiously optimistic about my new job. It’s similar work but a different model, nice company and people, and even though it’s not where I want to be long term, it’s a much slower pace that I kinda needed after all the bad. Based on my review last month I had started to hope that I would get a full-employment offer soon, but a few days ago I was told that they loved me and I was great, but they weren’t going to have more projects at my level to assign after I finish my current one.

I think I’m kinda in shock... my spouse works full time, but I figure drastic changes should be made to the monthly budget/expenses ASAP.  Since we just started building our savings back up again, there’s barely a month before I need to find a new job. So... 

Question #1: What should I do to try and make things work financially while I’m trying to find another new job in less than a year?

Question #2: Should I be looking for a different type of job altogether? 
After first being fired (even if it was a sh*t company) and then basically being told I wasn’t good enough/fast enough/smart enough to tackle more complex projects at the new job, I’m worried there’s something wrong with me. 

Which brings me to Question #3:
Considering the fact that we need to cut back on expenses and I need to find something in a month or less, is it a reasonable expense to go back to a career coach right now?  Is there any way that I have enough time to rethink my career goals and figure out what else I want to do AND find a new job?

Sorry that’s so long, but hopefully enough detail to help get any possible suggestions! And 100x thanks for whatever anyone has to offer!!",finance

personalfinance,Some questions about private student loans...,"Well I was debating on where the best place would be to ask this and from the advice I've seen here figured this was in fact the best, I hope I'm right and following the proper criteria...

Anyhow! I am planning on attending a University that has program set up specifically to train airline pilots. At the end you get a 4 year bachelors degree and all the ratings needed to start a career in aviation. The thing is, it's a bit more expensive than your traditional degree. It's definitely not as much as doctors, lawyers and a lot of others have to pay but it is up around 100k for the entire program, possibly more and not counting the assistance I would need for living expenses if I'm going full time (I've still not grasped fully how that works and where those funds come from). 

My biggest worry is, can I get all the funding I need? For a long time pilots were not able to get student aid, but now that flight training is connected to a college degree program it qualifies but again, the amounts are rather large. I'm aware federal student aid will probably only cover so much, I'm guessing it won't even cover 1/3rd the entire cost, leaving the rest to whether or not I can get the private student loans.

**My main question is, how hard are these to qualify for?** I'm not in my 20's anymore and have credit history built up. My score is right now some where around 625. It would be MUCH higher as I've nothing derogatory on my credit report, no missed payments, nothing bad, just credit utilization. I have about 10k worth of credit card debt over 3 different cards. I know if I could pay them off my credit score would increase, but it would take a few years and I'd really like to start on this path now, to get me going along the career path I want to build instead of wasting time doing more of what I hate.

It's really frustrating and maybe I'm overthinking it all, but I'm a bit worried. I don't know if I'll qualify for these private loans and if I do, what happens if I'm not approved for the amount I need? I MIGHT have the option of a co-signer, 1 person but that's a big maybe. Their credit is good but they are retired and I read your co-signer needs to have not only great credit but a stable income. Speaking of income, mine is a bit variable right now. I was making pretty good a year or two ago and not bad at all until about 4 months back. Since then I've been doing Uber full time as well as odd jobs for money, so that has me worried. 

If anyone can shed some light on what my chances are of getting approved, I'd appreciate it. Thanks a lot.",finance

personalfinance,Would it be Wise to Sell Income Property?,"Hello all, thank you in advance for any input. I am trying to help my parents improve their situation. Although I enjoy learning about finances and investing, it is far from my expertise! 

My parents are half owners of a shopping center (my uncle owns the other half). They make an annual income of 90,000 from it. It is completely paid off, and their half of the investment is worth about 1.7 million. 

The problem is their financial situation: My parents have 100k in credit card and personal loan debt. The reason? Taxes. Every year, they get a tax bill for approximately 25,000 (combined state and federal), and they always need to take out a loan to pay it. First it was selling vehicles, then refinancing their home, then putting it on credit cards. This problem has been building for a while. They are at the point where their credit utilization is so high that they cannot get another loan. 

Here are some solutions that I/we have come up with:

\-Sell 5% of their share to my uncle. This would get them out of debt, but it would not solve the problem. They would also need to pay taxes on it

\-Sell his half completely: This is the part that is way above my expertise. I know there is something called a 1030 exchange where he can avoid paying taxes, but can he use any of it to get out of debt? Are there any appropriate investing options for him that will allow him to pay his debts, reduce his tax burden, and make a decent return?

personalfinance,Thoughts on negotiating salary for a promotion?,"I'm a manager at a franchise restaurant, been working there for about 2.5 years and been a manager for over a year. I started at the bottom as a part time employee, was made a shift lead and then immediately first assistant manager when the GM at the time was fired, chose to stay in that position for probably almost a year now. Recently our GM had gotten a new job and quit without warning. Since then, I've been taking the role of GM/store manager, which has been a little over a month now. 

I've been at this store since its glory days, the busiest and most profitable it was, ever since that store manager was fired we've been playing catch up and we've gone through 4 GMs since, every time the entire weight of propping up the store fell on me, and it always sucked, but I have kept moving on. Before any of this, I had been offered to move up to be a GM a couple times, but I had kindly refused. This recent GM told me that his boss, one who offered me that promotion, had told him I was the most qualified to be a GM in our market of around 20 stores. 

Our most recent GM had been working for for the company for several years, was regarded as the best manager, was moved around store to store to get them back in shape, and definitely helped turn us around. When he left, the upper management came to talk with him on that last day, then asked me if I would want to take that position, I said it's not my career path to move up past being a GM and I'm not willing to be moved from this store, but I'd not mind taking that responsibility for the time being, they offered me $1.50 more per hour, I said that's fine, and they've been training me to be a GM since. I haven't seen that small pay raise either, but whatever.

Tomorrow, our area manager and some other upper management person are going to come and speak with me more about this all ""before taking this next step,"" I guess officially being made the store's GM. I have a lot of likes and dislikes about the role and responsibilities, part of it being a lack of support and competence from upper management, basically leaving me and other GM's at their own devices who can't rely on those above them who have always been supposed to and used to be helpful and effective. Most of it is how physically and bottom line demanding it is, you're constantly rushing as fast as you can before you're even open, then you try your best to get past the rush, especially since we're almost always understaffed and recently it was made that our hiring/staffing coordinator doesnt find staff for us anymore so it's on us to do so. The goals are borderline unrealistic, they squeeze as much out of you as possible and expect gold in return from dirt.

#THE POINT

We're losing managers more than before for some reason, a couple other GMs in our market left or are leaving, same with some assistants, there's nobody else available to fill in as a GM for my store, and that puts me in an interesting position. I was told that salary for GMs is $45,000 yearly, and I honestly don't think that's worth it, at least not for myself already struggling to fill in that role and trying to go back to school to pursue a graduate degree, I also feel like I've given so much for the company and store, more than any other past managers at our store and market I've been told, yet I've gotten nothing in return other than more pressure and workload dumped on me, on top of regularly voluntarily and questionably voluntarily working on breaks and off the clock since I'd first become an assistant manager.

I feel like it's too high to be realistic, but I'd love if I could manage to get $60k for officially stepping up. Especially now that our market is losing managers and other staff abnormally quickly, it's the time of year that is building up to our busiest period and employees are unavailable due to school back in session, and it's an unspoken rule, or more like mutual understanding, that GMs work longer hours than before, and are struggling to keep their stores afloat.

If they won't budge, fine, they can find someone else who gives a shit about the store, has actually been a manager for longer than a few months, has been working at one of the busiest stores in the market, and been through its rises and falls while choosing to stay there and take the brunt of it all. I can step down and go back to school full time. I'm already nearly burnt out, but if I know they care about me and other managers enough to provide an increased than base pay, I'll continue to return the effort and be reinvigorated to keep pushing on.

Does $60,000 from a $45,000 standard position salary sound reasonable or possible, given the circumstances? What should I really expect to meet at with them, if not more? Should I start out with a higher figure to make a number like this not seem so shocking or high, or would that be more harm than good?",finance

TLDR; Using a debit card puts you at greater risk and more pain if something happens than if your card than using a credit card.  Credit cards have 0 liability by federal law and they don't have your money while you investigate.  Debit card if they take money can take a long time to get your money back and you are at the mercy of your bank.

btc,Fed research fellow Charles Kahn has published a report which talks about the end of USD cash and advises the Fed not create e-cash but become its privacy regulator.,"* CCN: [Bitcoin is Cool: St. Louis Federal Reserve](https://www.ccn.com/bitcoin-is-cool-st-louis-federal-reserve/)
* The report: [Payment Systems and Privacy](https://research.stlouisfed.org/publications/review/2018/07/16/payment-systems-and-privacy) 
* Report's author: St Louis Fed research fellow [Charles Kahn](https://research.stlouisfed.org/econ/kahn/jp/) (Champaign, IL)

&gt;Abstract: Privacy in payments is desired not just for illegal transactions, but also for protection from malfeasance or negligence by counterparties or by the payments system provider itself. Proposals to abolish cash take inadequate account of these legitimate demands for privacy. While central banks can play a useful role in setting standards for payments privacy, they are unlikely to have a comparative advantage at providing privacy. Therefore the replacement of cash by central bank electronic money is likely to spur demand for alternative means of payments to solve specific privacy problems.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Best bank to open a savings account with?,"Hey all, 

Using my throw away because I have some friends and family that know my main account (and it might be bad if certain family members knew what I had). I'm a college student that currently works two jobs and have been doing my best to save. It has been a bit hard because I'm going to university full-time (which also costs a lot), and helping my mother with her debt.

I'm fortunate enough to qualify for aid, so the financial aid I'm receiving covers my school tuition. I took a $5,500 subsidized loan from my school though to help myself though as I'd be living on instant ramen without it if I tried to pay for my books/permit out of pocket. Anyways, I've been trying to be smart with my money and not spend the loan needlessly as well as saving. They disbursed $2,750 to me for the Fall, and the rest for the Spring. I probably only needed to use $300 of the loan each semester, so I'm trying to stuff it all in a bank with what I have saved to gain more interest on it. I'm hoping by the end of this to pay off the loan up front and have a little extra if I play my cards right. 

&amp;#x200B;

Right now I have about $4,300 in my account ($2,400 of that from my loan).

I estimated that I should probably have roughly $6,000-6,500 by my next paycheck. I'd really like to put this all into a savings account with a decent interest rate, but I don't know where to start looking. I bank with Chase and Wescom, but I heard Chase is terrible and I don't want to risk my Wescom account because I think my account is linked with some family members (had the account made when I was a child), and they may see my money and cause a commotion about me having it.

gaming,Must read before buying Xbox in India: Current state of Xbox support (India),"This is directed at Indian Xbox gamers. I wish that you don't have to go through what I am, so here's a few pointers before you buy your Xbox one X.

​

This information is all verified by Xbox support INDIA (Chat and phone).

**This information is valid for XBOX bought in INDIA.**

1. **No servicing center in India**.
2. To get it repaired you will be sending it to out of country.
3. After warranty (1 year only for Indian Customers) MS will fix my faulty Xbox for a price. However, you will have to bear the **cross country shipping charges** (which is from India to US - About **200$ for FedEx**);

​

I think the current state of Xbox support is horrible even after almost 4 years of Xbox One launch in India.

​

They are providing only 1 year of warranty (It's 3 for US customers). This is understandable. However I think it's outrageous to ask for **200$ just as shipping cost for repairs after warranty**. In India you also don't find any on-board after market parts for Xbox One X. So you are really out of luck if your Xbox dies after a year.

​

I also talked to them over the Phone. However they suggested something even more outrageous.

​

**After 1 year (warranty period) MS will not repair your (INDIAN) console.**

​

I am not sure if that is correct, but if it is essentially if you buy a INDIAN console and it goes bad after a year, they are essentially suggesting to throw it away.

All of this information is verified by MS support India. People I talked to is Glenn S. and Paul (Glenn's manager) \[Log below\]​

​

The person on the phone eventually told me to post somewhere so that it gets to the right authority. However, when I asked if he can take a feedback, he got really emotional and said

They don't have the right tools to help the customer and if they keep taking these feedbacks, to can't reach their goals and then they are eventually kicked out. I would love to post that voice recording but I have yet to go through it to remove any personally identifying information.

​

**I sincerely hope this gets some attention and gets to the right authorities and things improve for Indian customers.** Thank you for reading my long post.

​

**Here is the chat log (Glenn and Paul)**

Me

So here's a few things to confirm

1. India has no service centers for Xbox.
2. To get it repaired you will be sending it to out of country.
3. After warranty (1 year only for Indian Customers) you will repair my faulty Xbox. However, I'll have to bear the cross country shipping charges.

Oh! I'm very happy to hear that you are aware of the shipping process. Was Glenn able to discussed this with you?

yes. Can you confirm that all the mentioned points are 100% true?

I perfectly understand how you feel about the shipping process in your current region. Technically, sending your console for a service to our service center. Their will be a courier pick up to help you with that process. Since its true that Microsoft don't have any service center yet in your region.

Meaning all the information that was provided by Glenn is 100% correct.",technology

I'm looking to move jobs from the federal realm into contractor after one year of work. I am currently making 65k a year in a low cost of living area. I was offered 86k from a very large company, but the interview process and job description have me less than excited about the position. I feel that I shouldn't turn it down though just to the massive pay increase compared to what I am currently making. I like the idea of making such a jump early on in my career to set me up to keep increasing in the future to higher.

I am also interviewing with a smaller company right now however I've been told they will not be able to match the 86k salary I was offered from the large company.  I am not sure where they would be on salary exactly I assume around 75k mark. The smaller company work enviorment seems much nicer, I was treated as a human during the interview process and felt like I was getting to know the hiring team and people I'd work with/for. Additionally the work that was described to me sounded much more interesting.

&amp;#x200B;

As far as benefits go between the two they are both very good. The smaller company beats out the larger company with better healthcare and continuing education costs.

So I am left with a dilema of do I take the currently offered \~20k raise from the large company that I'm worried I won't enjoy either the work or the people I'm working with. Or do I go with the smaller company and get probably roughly \~10-12k less than the Larger comapnies salary but with a better work enviornement and slightly better benefits.",finance

For a bunch of unrelated reasons, I quit my job in July 2018 and started a new one that I'm waaay happier with, and now (rightfully so) have to pay back my signing bonus. The CEO of the company gave me until the end of 2018 to pay it back and I do have the money, but he's requesting that I pay it back in its full pre-tax amount of $13,500, even though I never saw $4,585.96 of it. Since the bonus was paid in a different year, apparently the way to recoup this money isn't super straightforward.

I did some research on my own that basically explained to me 1) the company needs to file an amended 941 form to recoup the Medicare and Social Security withholding, and 2) once I repay them, they need to give me a W2-C to file with my 2018 returns in order for me to get a refund (or a credit? not exactly sure) on the $3,553.21 that I paid with my 2017 taxes. I emailed the CEO about this, who then spoke to his accountant, and his reply was the following:

&gt;""You are correct that {company name} will need to file an amended 941 return in order to receive the credit for both the employer and employee FICA and Medicare payments. Therefore, I agree that it is best that you reduce your payment to {company name} by $1032.75. Regarding the federal and state tax portions, {company name} doesn't issue a corrected 2017 W2 for you since the bonus wages were actually paid in 2017 and the year has closed. The procedure for claiming a miscellaneous deduction or negative income on Form 1040 personal tax returns in 2018 has been impacted by the recently-enacted tax reform and it would be best to contact an accountant if you wish to receive guidance on it.""

Basically, my question boils down to how accurate this is and what will I get back if I file a Form 1040? It seems a little bit fishy that they won't give me a W2-C since my understanding of that form is that it's literally used to correct the wages that were reported as paid for up to 3 years from when the original return was filed. If anyone has any advice or insight on what I should do moving forward with this, I would really appreciate it! This is only going to be my second time filing taxes (I'm only 23) and I want to make sure I'm fully informed before I start giving them their money back.",finance
personalfinance,Left Federal Gov't Job - Rollover 401k into TSP?,"I recently left my job with the federal government, where I had both a TSP (Traditional) and 401k (Traditional).  The options I am considering are to either:

* (1) rollover my 401k into my TSP, 
* (2) rollover 401k into a new IRA, or 
* (3) rollover both into a new IRA.  

I'm fairly confident that I will land a new job soon that provides a 401k, so I was hoping to just rollover into my new employer's plan.  However, I'm not sure I'll start working in time to do that (you only have 90 days after leaving federal service to make a decision).  My main concern is that I want to still be able to contribute to whatever accounts I have, and I'm not sure that's possible with TSP after leaving my federal job.

personalfinance,Is there a way to mitigate credit damage with voluntary vehicle surrender?,"Hey All,

​

Long story short, I cosigned on a car with a gf at the time (NEVER DO THIS!).  We broke up, and I found my true love.  We're getting married and I disclosed this to her and it's been a strain on our relationship.  I've been reaching out to the ex, who hasn't missed any payments but is more or less refusing to refinance the car in her name.  I am about fed up with dealing with her as we've been separated over a year and a half now.  Because the car is in my name, I figure I can voluntarily surrender it and pay the bank the difference to get her out of my hair.  I am concerned about the credit ramifications of this, as I've worked extremely hard to increase my credit score these last few years.  Is there anything I should be aware of going into this, or how to frame the situation to the bank?

​

Edit: Based on documentation I have found in the online account (which is attached to my name and not hers), documentation (payoff quote letter, interest rate letter) show my name alone.  I am wondering now how much legal right she has to the car at all

&amp;#x200B;

I am located in Florida and just received my Associates at community college. I did not plan to receive further education until I actually finished the degree and realized an Associates will not amount to much in terms of job opportunities. I was lucky enough to receive full federal pell grants and Florida Student Assist Grants for the duration of my time at community college. Although it looks like going into university I will not receive any benefits considering my father is working full time, but will not be helping me throughout school. He would if he could, FAFSA thinks otherwise. I do not live with my parents, and they do not help me with any expenses. After getting the application process finished I plan on going to the Financial Aid office of the school and seeing what they can do for me in terms of the FAFSA. Although I was wondering if taking out loans would ultimately be the smart thing to do in this situation. I have a little over $8,000 saved in liquid savings, but would like to rise that number back to $10k and keep as emergency fund. I've had many big expenses come up within the past that the emergency fund has saved my ass, and would like to keep it. It scares me to think I can blow through all the money I saved paying for school, but taking out loans scares me even more. These grants were the savior of my college career, considering I probably would not have even gone to community college without them. 20M From Florida. Work full time as a Server making decent tips. I have been applying for many scholarships through a website but am not sure just how effective it may be.

personalfinance,HELOC To Pay Off Debt,"Like the title says, I'm looking into consolidating debt with higher interest rates to one loan amount with a lower interest rate with a home equity line of credit.  
I live alone and am the sole owner of the home. I'm 28 and have owned the home for 3 years. 

The debts are as follows...  
(I rarely make the minimum monthly payment towards my loans to help pay them down faster.)

|Loan|Amount|Minimum Monthly $|Interest|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Car|$10,390|$284.00|3.66%|
|Credit Card|$7,820|$200|12.9%|
|*Student Loan*|*$22,670*|*$293*|*5.9%*|

*I've debated including the student loan in what to pay off because I can write off the interest for this loan during tax time.*

My bank currently has a promo running, waiving application fee and credit check fee, totaling something around $200 or so, just to try to make the loan more appealing.

Their current advertised interest rates for HELOCs vary between the payment schedule, going up to 30 years.  
I've leaned towards the 15 year and 10 year.

|Schedule|APR|Monthly pmt per $1,000 Borrowed|
|:-|:-|:-|
|10 Year|4.127%|$10.12|
|15 Year|4.214%|$7.46|
|20 Year|4.570%|$6.33|
|30 Year|4.676%|$5.15|

Total loan amount with student loans included would be $40,880.  
I know these interest and payments can change after credit checks and what not, but this is their advertised rate, so it's what i have to go off of for now.

Current monthly payments right now are $777.00 / Mo.  
So to compare minimum monthly payments after the loan is taken...

(Rounded up)  
10 Year: $417.71  
15 Year: $304.97  
20 Year: $258.78  
30 Year: $210.54

Savings with 10 year loan is $359.29 / Mo if student loans were included in the HELOC amount.

Hopefully my math checks out...

personalfinance,"I have $66k in student loans. I just got a state job and became eligible for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness. Should I pay the minimum payments under PSL or throw $1,000/mo at them?","I am a female, 25 years old, and live in Aurora CO outside of Denver. I am single, and have no plans to marry or have children. No plans to purchase a home (my step mother and father own two homes which will eventually be left to me).

​

I have nearly 66k in student loan debt. All are federal government student loans with fixed interest rates between 3.4% and 6.8%. I have four loans with 6.8% interest rates (these are the highest).

​

I just got a state job doing work in my major. I gross $3,635 monthly, but I am exempt from FICA because of a state pension plan. I pay 8% into my pension plan, and my state division matches it by 20%. I believe that I have to work 5 years to be vested and maintain the match should I leave. I did put my information into the online salary calculator and it's estimating that after taxes and deductions I should have about $2750-2800.

​

My monthly expenses are as follows:

​

Rent + Utilities: $750

Employee sponsored health/vision/dental insurance: $160

Storage (I'm trying to sell unused furniture to get rid of this expense): $95

Car insurance: $80

Groceries: $205 (I'm vegan and budget for this amount, but sometimes it's $255ish)

Pet food: $110 (No plans for more pets, had to put my senior dog down last week. I feed my cat good quality food to minimize health problems and vet bills long term)

Public transit: $40

Gas (if needed): $46

​

I budget and live frugally. Pending no emergency expenses, my monthly expenses are about $1536-$1800

I have $1100 in my savings account and plan to save about $600/mo (20%) towards my emergency fund

​

Outside of student loan debt, I have about $450 in medical debt that I am paying down and I owe a family friend about $3000 for lending me money to move in February.

​

Under the PSLF plan, my minimum payments will be about $250-$300/mo. After making the minimum payments for 10 years, they would be forgiven. I could do this and stash all of the other money away into savings. This would be nice because I would be prepared better for emergencies and could travel (I know that travel isn't a priority, but it is something that I have always dreamed of doing even if it's just 1 or 2 trips a year).

​

My other option is to throw $1,000/mo at these student loans, save $600/mo, continue living extremely frugally, and have them completely paid off in 7-8 years.

​

I'm not sure which scenario would be best. I do want to go to graduate school eventually and know I want to go out of the country for this. If I waited ten years to do that, I would be 35 when I began working towards graduate school. The age factor isn't a problem at all, but I know that life isn't predictable and that 10 years is a long time. I also don't see me staying in this job for 10 years because I would like to be promoted and grow in my career. I could always apply to higher positions in 2-5 years and I also have the option of moving states to other state jobs or pursuing federal employment in order to maintain the PSLF plan.

​

Based on all of this, I would really appreciate some help figuring out which scenario would be better for myself. I'm leaning towards paying them off as fast as possible, but it would also be nice to save up some money and live just a little bit.
