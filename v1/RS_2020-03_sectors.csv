personalfinance,Are high yield savings accounts really that great?,"I have a traditional savings account that houses my emergency fund with my bank in the US and the interest rate is, understandably, pitiful. So I started looking at high yield savings accounts (HYSA) and honestly they seem overall pretty great. 

I also have a traditional 401k that is being fully matched and a Roth 401k so I would essentially use this HYSA to park my emergency fund and have it grow.

My questions are 1) are there any really downsides to HYSAs, beyond withdrawal limits (which I don’t mind)? 

2) Is having my emergency fund in a HYSA a good idea? I am leaning to yes because I can just have it continue to grow.

3) In addition to Q2, should I just start using my [potential] HYSA to just house all my savings? Ideally I would benefit by having my savings grow more and grant me more income for me to do what I want (e.g. travel, apartment improvement, down payments, etc.)? Would it be best to have multiple HYSAs for each of these goals?",finance
economy,The US economy is a house of cards,"We have been hearing about how fantastic the US economy is.  That may be in question after last week, but a decline is probably overdue.  I think we have all been fed hype by a rigged system

Unemployment is at all-time lows, but the quality of the jobs keeps declining.  1/3 of American workers make less than $20,000 a year, and about 1/2 make less than $30,000.  People work longer hours for worse (or no) benefits with no job security.

The American dream is fading.  We are seeing a generation to generation standard of living decline.  The middle class is being replaced with haves, and mostly, have-nots. Corporations have been contributing to this decline with a 100% focus on shareholders.  Outsourcing, lay-offs, temp workers, reduced benefits, and automation have led to where we are today.

At least we have the stock market to boost our wealth!  For those who have enough income to actually save and invest, the stock market has been on a wild bull run since the great recession of 2008. Stocks nearly tripled under Obama, and continued to rise under Trump until last week.  The stock run-up has driven a tremendous growth in wealth for the top echelons in the US.

The United States is absolutely the wealthiest country in the world.  There are 18.6 million millionaires in the US - about 40% of all the dollar millionaires globally.  Americans are even more dominant in the percentage of Ultra High Net Worth Individuals (UHNWI's) who have over $50 million, and of course we rule when it comes to billionaires.

With all this wealth, the median net worth in the US is $65,000.  Sound OK?  Less than 15% of Americans have a pension, so $65K is really not going to take you very far in retirement.  Wealth in America is extremely top heavy.  Most people do not have adequate savings and are not prepared for retirement.

Predicting the stock market is not possible in the short term, but there are some observations that can be made:

* If you look back in time, you can observe painful stock market corrections and bear markets every few years.  The last big ones were in 2008 and 2000.
* The Government has been injecting huge amounts of liquidity into the system.
* Corporations have taken on record levels of debt, lured by artificially low interest rates.
* Companies have been using profits to buy-back their own stock - boosting stock options and c-suite Exec compensation instead of investing for growth.
* By most measures, the stock market valuation is much higher than historical averages (still).

That does not necessarily mean the stock market is going to continue to crash in the short term.  However, history tells us that a bear market will come.  Prepare.

Stock market corrections and recessions are pretty much inevitable.  With the right preparation, the Government can typically respond in ways that bring things back to normal over time, including lowering  interest rates or stimulus spending.  Unfortunately, we have squandered the good economics of the past 11 years and will not have those tools available.  Interest rates have been kept artificially low, and there is now little margin left to lower them further if a recession hits.  In addition, the deficit has ballooned under the most recent administration to $1 trillion, so stimulus spending will be difficult.

The Government is currently spending 1 trillion dollars a year more than they take in through taxes and other revenues, and the only thing we have to show for it is a richer top 1%, a whole lot of low paying jobs with little or no benefits, and crippling debt for our children to deal with.

When politicians tell you the economy is fantastic, be skeptical and do some research.  This is especially true when they tell you one day that your Medicare and Social Security will not be touched and then propose massive cuts to those areas in a budget proposal a couple of days later.  We need to make some structural changes to get back on track so be open-minded to new ideas and don't rely on the status quo being sustainable.",finance
personalfinance,Best way out of a bad loan,"Figuring how to fix a bad loan.

I was hoping for some advice on the best way to approach this.


Due to not fully understanding what I was doing when I was younger, I signed an auto loan at 15.99% interest. 
My payoff amount is now $7268.37.

I'm currently paying $436 a month for this loan. The maturity date is 22 months.


I have the option to borrow against my 401k.
I am able to withdraw $5500 at 5.75% apr, with repayments being paid back bi weekly directly from my paycheck. I have the option to make the choice for how long repayment would take, and I'm considering setting it for 2 years, or 50 payments for $116.32 a check. 
That saves me about 200 a month which I could REALLY use. 

As for the left over 1768, I would work on paying that down over the next two or three months, but figured if I were make a large payment of the $5500, that would pay down quite a bit on the principal balance, helping lower the amount of daily interest the loan is accumulating. 

I would be able to make more than than the 230 each month, which would allow me to pay it off, but if I understand correctly, this would actually save me money due to the differences in the APR.

I do not have the option for refinancing, or paying the vehicle off with a personal loan, credit card, or anything like that. This is about my only option that I have to help free up a little space financially each month.

Thanks in advance.


Edit: Thank you for the feedback, everyone.

As far as not being able to get a loan, the main issue is with my current credit / debt to ratio.
Unfortunately the past few years have been rough financially, and i spent a while on disability after some severe injuries and a cancer diagnosis, which lead to having to use my credit cards, and medical bills going to collections. I am working on paying down the credit cards, and working to pay off / settle the collections to help improve my score. 

I have not spoke with a credit union, however after looking at some other places online, I was given 30% interest rates which I wont even think about touching. 

My tax refund was about $500, and was used to pay down a credit card. 

As far as getting another job, between my current job, college, and my health issues, im not able to get another job.",finance

personalfinance,Buy a duplex or rent?,"So very new to actually posting on reddit so please forgive me if I make any mistakes in this post. 

With that said here is my current situation: I'm a 26M and still living at home. I stayed at home for this long because I wanted to save money and I had no immediate need to move out. However, I've let this go on for too long. I'm the type of person that can easily become too comfortable with a situation and can easily drag my feet whenever I should be moving on.   So I'm giving myself a kick and beginning the steps of moving out. For the longest time my ideal vision of this would have been buying a duplex and renting out the other half so I could live month to month as close to free as I could get it . So following up on that vision, I've been pre-approved for an owner occupied duplex and I've been shopping around. However, the housing market where I live is crazy competitive (with relatively high prices to boot) and any offer I've made has been out bid with cash.  Now.... As I'm sure many of you are aware, the stock market took a sizable/serious hit this past week and there is serious debate whether or not it will get worse. So I guess my fundamental question should I keep trying to fight for a duplex or rent for a year or two and see how both the housing and stock markets shake out (or is there a better option????). I'll describe my thoughts on both options but first let me briefly describe the finances that I'm working with:

# Income:

* Salary - $84,500
* Salary (after 401k) - $65,000
* Net monthly take home (after insurance, taxes, etc...) - \~$3000

# Expenses (monthly):

* Auto loan - $320 ($6000 left on loan)
* Student loan - $420 ($9000 left on loan)
* Everything else - \~$1000 (Auto insurance, phone bill, food, subscriptions, etc...)

# Assets (Everything I have as of 2/29/2020. A lot of this is from a recent inheritance):

* Cash (for buying a duplex) - \~$80,000
* Investment Portfolio - \~$170,000 (70% equity funds, 20% bond funds, 10% REITS)
* 401k - \~$77,000
* Truck (2015 Toyota tacoma) - \~$18,000
* Savings - $20,000 

&amp;#x200B;

So here's the options I thought of so far:

# Buying a duplex

This was the original goal but has proven to be a pain to carry out. Not to mention the stock market has me a little spooked at the moment (if things go really south I have no idea what it will do to the housing market). I live in Philadelphia currently and was planning to buy a duplex in the city somewhere (not too specific on the location but I don't want to be shot if you know what I mean lol). So if your familiar with the multifamily market in the area feel free to let me know what you think. Problems I've had so far:

* Strong Sellers market
* The competition for multifamily properties is crazy. They are flying off the shelf. Like you have two days max if its decent buy to get a bid in or its gone. On top of that, assuming i can get a bid in, if its a reasonably priced property I've been out bid with cash offers twice already.
* If the property isn't reasonably priced, its a turn key where they're charging well over average price for the area.
* My pre-approval is for owner occupied. Lowers my selection even more because at least one unit must be vacant. To get an investors loan you add another 1-2% to the interest rate.

# Renting (for a year or two):     

So renting wasn't in my original plan but its worth considering, especially with everything that's been going on in the markets. With renting I've always thought of it as throwing money away. However, given my struggles as described above, the sky high real-estate market and the recent turmoil in the stock market. I'm wondering if its smarter to rent for a year (at least) and DCA the 80k into the stock market to put that money to work in the mean time.

I'm trying to think of the best option in terms of an investment. There are pros - cons to both as far as I'm concerned. Let me know what you think.",finance
MachineLearning,[D] Attention is All You Need - Transformer Decoder &amp; Shared Matrices Question,"I was reading the paper and I am confused about the things below:

* Under section 3.4 Embeddings and Softmax it is stated: 'we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax linear transformation, similar to \[30\]. In the embedding layers, we multiply those weights by d\_model\^0.5.'
   * Which weight matrices are shared exactly? As I understand there is one embedding before the encoder stack, one before decoder stack and one that turns the output of the decoder stack to logits. In paper \[30\], they tie input embedding and output embedding for NN Language models.
   * The last sentence seems to suggest that not all weight matrices are multiplied by d\_model\^0.5. Are only before-encoder and before-decoder embedding matrices multiplied?
   * What exactly is the softmax linear transformation? Are W\_V, W\_Q and W\_K multiplications what they are referring to?
* It is a bit unclear what the decoder input for each token's generation. Are all tokens fed into the decoder because the masking takes care of it?
* Also a bit unclear at the output of the decoder too. To generate the first token after the start-of-sequence token, only &lt;sos&gt; is not masked out thus only one row of log probabilities are produced for generating the next token. However for generating the next token after that, only \[&lt;sos&gt;, token\_1\] are not masked thus two rows of log probabilities are produced. 
   * Is the ""re-generate""d token\_1 not included in the calculation of the loss when token\_2 is generated? Following the same logic, are ""re-generated"" token\_1 &amp; token\_2 not included in the loss when token\_3 is generated?

personalfinance,Cash out refi time?,"Hi,

Looking for some refi advice. I've been in my current place for 7 years and have a 30 year mortgage at about 3.625% interest rate.  I originally put down 20%, which was $64k (320k purchase price). I have about $220k left on the loan, and my place is worth around $560k. I feel like 3.625% is pretty low, but I see that mortgage rates have sunk. Is it worth doing a refi now, or will the closing costs eat up all the savings?

Separately, I'm thinking of doing a cash out refi so I can take the equity and buy some rental properties. I live in CA, so there won't be many places under $500k. But I figure I could put down 200k and get a loan on a rental for $300k.

Any advice on the scenarios above?",finance
personalfinance,Quick and dirty attempt to drop PMI on a mortgage held by Wells Fargo,"\*\*\*Update 3/30/2020 Wells Fargo dropped the PMI!

\*\*\*UPDATE: After multiple calls placed to both WF and Mueller Services I was finding that the original appraiser had not completed the file almost one month after the initial property site inspection. I left a message on her personal cell (available through public information searches for Alaska certified appraisers). She is also an Alaska state House representative, so I called her office and left a message there. Low and behold (with no call back from her) the file was updated and uploaded so that WF could access it. Mueller services was also kind enough to email the appraisal report to me. The appraisal came back at $475,000!  40k more than I needed it to be to drop PMI. I have now been on hold for 2 hours with WF to get them to drop the PMI before the April 1 mortgage payment. Will update as there are new developments.

&amp;#x200B;

I previously posted with questions about which avenue to pursue to drop my PMI. Pertinent details are;

I bought the house in 2016 for 390k, it was and continues to be a very hot market with extremely limited supply in a resort area.

I have a really low interest rate (3.375) so there is no reason to go full on refi at this time.

I remodeled an existing living space above a detached garage with a 3/4 bathroom and a kitchenette. I paid to have water and sewer connected to this building. Total remodel cost was just under 35k

I pay approximately 180 per month in PMI, and I am currently at an 88% LTV with an expected PMI drop in 2024.

Comps in my area are selling at a premium, often within the first day of listing. These homes range from 550k-650k. Zillows zestimate for my house range from 441-593k

I am getting taxed at a 430k valuation from the county assessor

So, I petitioned WF to drop my PMI and they sent me about 8 pages of paperwork. They offered me 3 options, none of which was an AVM because in AK there is no requirement to disclose publicly what a homes sale price is;

1. Broker's price opinion: Unlike what you may read in other threads, WF very clearly spelled this out for me in terms of what it was and what it was not. "" A BPO is done by a real estate broker. The broker will also determine a value based on similar homes in the area. The broker does not take into consideration the property's features. A BPO is less comprehensive than an appraisal, but it costs less. A BPO might be best if your property is similar to others in your area, and if there are no renovations or unique features that you want to be considered in its total value"" (a direct quote). So anyone saying a BPO can be based in significant structural improvements where you submit a list of your improvements with cost is most definitely mistaken. I commented in another PMI thread about this but the poster *insisted*  he got a BPO. I'm pretty sure he did not. There is a definitely incorrect information about this, *in these threads*. My BPO price: $150
2. Restricted appraisal: ""Is done by a state licensed and certified appraiser. A property inspector will measure the property and take pictures and provide the data to the appraiser. The appraiser will determine a value by comparing the property's features with similar homes in the area. An appraisal might be best if your property has had a lot of renovations or if it has unique features that you want to be considered in its total value"". I had the ability to choose option A for this or option B..Option 2a) Determine a new value with significant improvements. The cost of improvements needs to be at least 30,908.  (WF said this appraisal needed to come back at 426,635 or an LTV of 80%) Cost: $325Option 2b) Determine a new value without significant improvements. (WF said this appraisal needed to come back at 455,077 or an LTV of 75%) Cost: $325

So I obviously picked restricted appraisal, determine a new value with significant improvements. They made arrangements to send out a property inspector to come out and see the property. When she called, this individual stated she was sent a file from Fannie Mae and that she was trying to arrange a time to collect information about the property. I got everything set up for her.

She was not supplied with the list of my improvements, so I emailed them to her. Her email was with [muellerreports.com](https://muellerreports.com). After doing some research I am starting to get a really bad feeling about how this is going to turn out. Mueller reports is known for sending underpaid and overworked inspectors out, who do generally try to do a decent job but commonly do not. The fact that she did not have my improvement list was not surprising, and after all I did get it to her. But, she texted me and asked me my lot square footage - *publicly available data*\- through the county. I snapped a screenshot and sent that to her with the web address. As far as I know she is actually supposed to be out there taking measurements.... She asked several other questions over text, and she had access to the house because there were people there to let her in. She spent very little time there and could not answer questions I had for her about what my valuation was or when I would be notified about it.

To be clear, Wells Fargo requires that you use their inspector/appraiser for these valuations. Understandably so, as I suppose as real estate appraisal can produce valuations all over the board. Nonetheless, I am anticipating bad news and I am already trying to figure out what (if any) recourse I may have. Specifically because I paid for $325 for what seems like very little time spent on the property, and potentially a wholly inaccurate valuation. Worst case situation they can drop my valuation from my original purchase price, pushing my PMI even further down the road - if they do this I will raise hell. There is no way any property in this market could lose value unless it was heavily damaged in the recent large earthquake. Best case situation we get to at least 80% LTV and I drop the PMI.

I will keep you updated.",finance
devops,Would you accept lower salary than your current job for a company with better fundamentals?,"&amp;#x200B;

I've been interviewing lately because of some concerns I have about the future of my current company. I really like my job, and my salary is competitive, I think. I am a fully remote Sr. SRE with a base of 145k and some bonus, good benefits, and good work/life balance. I'm self taught and have a lot of job experience but no degree.

&amp;#x200B;

Today I received my first offer after several interviews.

&amp;#x200B;

The offer is for 125k starting. This is \~14% less base salary than I'm currently making. I'm trying to get some more info so I can calculate the total comp,  but at first glance it looks like a lesser package across the board,  ie my current company covers 50% of my wife/daughter insurance etc, which this company does not.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm definitely considering countering the offer before outright declining it, but they sortof told me in the email that this was what they could offer and it was partially based on the cost-of-living of my area,  which is fairly LCOL. However I work remotely currently, and would work remotely for them as well (most of the time), and think of myself as a citizen of the internet and not of my city really when it comes to compensation.

&amp;#x200B;

This seems like a no-brainer, but there are two big factors I'm considering.

&amp;#x200B;

1. My current company is not profitable after \~8 years. There has been significant employee churn since I started, key players in engineering have left. It is V.C. funded, it's completely owned by investors and I assume extremely diluted stock wise. I don't really see a path upwards for myself, and the company could be insolvent in 12 months for all I know.
2. The new company was self-bootstrapped by it's founder/CEO into immediate profitability and has remained so for \~6 years. They are experiencing high growth, have told me that they want me to grow into the SRE lead/manager role at which point my comp could be raised.  They've also supposedly 2.5x the options grant to try to bridge the gap. But these are just numbers of options, which obviously gives me very little information on actual value.

&amp;#x200B;

If I had to guess I would say its going to be more work and less money though.

personalfinance,"30-Day Challenge #3: Prepare your tax return accurately and file early (March, 2020)","# 30-day challenges

We are pleased to continue our 30-day challenge series. Past challenges can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/30daychallenges).

This month's 30-day challenge is to **Prepare your Tax Return Accurately, and File Early**. 

You've successfully completed this challenge once you've filed your US federal income tax return by March 31st.

Recommended Steps:

###Plan
1. **Learn how US income taxes work:**
* Watch [Basics of US income tax rate schedule](https://www.khanacademy.org/economics-finance-domain/core-finance/taxes-topic/taxes/v/basics-of-us-income-tax-rate-schedule)
* Watch [Tax deductions introduction](https://www.khanacademy.org/economics-finance-domain/core-finance/taxes-topic/taxes/v/tax-deductions-introduction)
* Read /r/personalfinances's very own [wiki page on income tax](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/taxes)
* *Understand* what exactly your tax return is: A form you fill out, telling the government how much money you made, calculating how much taxes you owe on that money (your ""tax liability""), and ""squaring-up"" with the government: Figuring out if you already paid more than your actual tax liability throughout the year with paycheck withholdings (in which case you will get a tax *refund*), or if you haven't paid enough throughout the year, and owe a balance to the government.
2. [Determine your filing status](https://www.irs.gov/uac/what-is-my-filing-status) and determine whether you can be claimed as a dependent by anyone (for example, your parents), or can claim any dependents. ([IRS Dependent Tool](https://www.irs.gov/uac/who-can-i-claim-as-a-dependent))
3. **Prepare a ""map"" for what documentation you will need to fill out your tax return**, then go through the list and make sure you have the documentation for each. **Don't worry if you forget something.** The software you use to fill out your tax return (or the tax return form itself) will remind you of things you might have forgotten.
* Jot down every possible way you made money this year (remember, even if you don't get a form, you still need to report it):
    * paycheck from my job (W-2 form)
    * interest on my bank account (personal records like your December account statement, or a 1099 form)
    * dividends from my stock (1099-Div)
    * income from my small business or self employment (personal records, or 1099 form)
* Make a list of all the possible deductions you might think you are eligible for, and make sure you have documentation:
    * mortgage interest you paid (1098)

I had planned to pull the money out of there, but I'm wondering if it makes more sense to leave it there given the market turmoil going on right now. I'm fairly sure I can scrape together the money using on-budget savings, it will just take cancelling a lot of my savings goals, and risking not being able to pay a credit card in full (luckily, that card has a 0% interest rate until October, so I can pay the minimum while building the balance back up).

personalfinance,(US) Is my Federal tax *actually* this much??,"Hello, all. New to the world of doing taxes. I'm a freelance writer who has not been doing the quarterly estimates (didn't realize this was a thing until, well, now). Here's my question: 
  
I just calculated my taxes on two different programs (to double check). I earned a little bit below $20K through freelance writing this year (all 1099s), and the Fed tax alone is supposedly just a few bucks under $3K ($300-ish is labelled as ""tax"" and the other 2.5K is ""self-employment tax""). Do those numbers sound right to you guys/gals? That doesn't include any penalties or state taxes or anything like that; that's just the base tax.
  
If that large Fed tax number sounds right for someone in my income bracket, let me know. Otherwise I'll go to a local library's free tax filing course, but I really don't see what they'd do differently (enter the 1099's online, choose standard deduction since I don't have many itemized ones, etc.). I'd like to save time if I'm just being a worry wart.

personalfinance,"MyFedLoan ""denies"" IDR and being confusing on PSLF - am I okay?","Greetings,

I apologize if there is a quick post to answer this question/scenario before, I tried to search around and didn't find one. If there is one, feel free to call me a dolt and point to it.

I have been fortunate over the last several years to have an increase in my income such that paying under IBR would be more than the 10 year standard repayment plan.

I have two consolidated loans, one subsidized and one non-subsidized with balance totaling around 75k. I have been making qualifying payments for PSLF for about 6 years now, with an eligibility date of 2024. 

I just had to recertify my income, and this was the first year that my income would make my payments &gt; standard repayment plan. I tried to do some research ahead of recertification in order to understand what would happen. My research seemed to indicate that you can never be 'kicked off' IBR even if you don't have a partial financial hardship, and if your income ever increases to the point that your payments would be &gt; than the standard 10 year repayment, you will simply pay that amount.

I expected my income recertification application to be 'accepted' and the calculation to indicate I should pay the 10 year standard repayment amount. However, I received an email that had the subject ""We denied your IDR request""

""We were not able to process your recertification request for your Income-Driven Repayment Plan. A letter will be sent detailing the reasons that we could not approve your request and next steps if you think this information is correct.""

The application status when I log into the MyFedLoan account is 'denied.' I waited a couple of weeks to get the letter, but did not get one. I called their phone number and they said they didn't actually send a letter (WHAT?!), but that the reason I was denied is because I no longer have a partial financial hardship and am being removed from the program in favor of the 10 year standard repayment plan. I tried to counter that I did not believe I could be removed from the program, simply that my payments UNDER IBR would be equal to the 10 year. They said oh yes that's what we meant, don't worry. I asked for a letter that states this and they said they would send a letter, since they never sent one originally.

I waited another 2 weeks and have no letter - so I have now called twice again. The first person said you have no partial financial hardship and have been removed from the program, and then when I countered she disconnected and put me back into the waiting queue. The third person said I do not have a partial financial hardship and am being removed from the ""partial financial hardship part of the program"" but am still on IBR and my payments will qualify for PSLF.

It's important that my payments are still qualifying because I only have another 4 years of payments to make before the PSLF. My research now seems to indicate that any payment that is either income based OR AT LEAST as much as the standard 10 year repayment should be qualifying (though I know the Dept of Ed has currently made PSLF program a shit show and nobody really knows). So I am not sure if this is a legitimate issue to worry with MFL about, or just accept what they've done because my payments are still qualfying.

If I'm not okay, how do I get them to change it at this point? I have called 3 times, I will send an email this week, but nobody seems to have a care to make sure this is clearly understood when I'm talking with them. They tell me they cannot send a letter that includes this information.

personalfinance,Does anyone have any knowledge about appealing/protesting NY State taxes?,"I apologize if this isn't the correct place for this but I didn't see a sub that was good for it. 

This has to deal with a child tax credit. I had my dependent the majority of the year in 2015(been fighting this for 3 years now). 2015 was the year my ex and I separated for the last time. The other person who is claiming my dependent for that year is my ex. 

I have appealed 3 times already and have had 1 conciliatory meeting. All of these times they have denied my appeals.  

Currently I am in the process of waiting for another conciliatory meeting. However without any additional information I believe they will deny my appeal again. I could pay the $700 however I strongly feel this isn't right. I am the one who provided for my dependent (roof, food and supervision) and the child tax credit should reflect that. Additionally I am afraid that Federal will come after me if I do pay and want the child credit back which would cause me another year of being  in debt. I have been living under my means for years and working hard. If I don't have to pay these I should be debt free this year!

NY State ""advocates"" are counting 256 days for ex and 253 days for me. They are counting the whole month of May for the ex because ""on or around May"" was stated in 2 court record I provided. However I know it wasn't the full month. His things weren't moved out of the apartment I leased until May. However his actual person wasn't in the home in February. The other days for him come at the end of the year when the state awarded him temp custody until I won the custody hearing. 

The school records show that the dependent was in the home with both parents until June. Which is incorrect as I didn't update the school because at the time he didn't have a car or place to stay so I wasn't concerned with him picking up at school unauthorized. 

They won't accept my bank statement with hotel bills for 2 separate stays with my dependent out of town. 1 stay equaling 7 days and the other 3 days (1 day hotel receipt). These were for Easter and Memorial Day. 

I have been really stressed out and can't seem to move past this as I feel it isn't right.

Edit: I talked to a lawyer and he said it would be around $3000 to have help fighting this. I will continue with petition but feel inadequate.",finance

personalfinance,Need some advice on affordable home for my mom - help!,"This might get long, but i'll include details to try an save questions. 

**Here it is:**   
My mom has medical conditions that make it impossible for her to work due to medications. She hasn't worked a 'job' other than raising kids (me, my brother, and my sister - Dad passed when I was 10) in my entire life, (im 31). She has been having increasing medical problems - and just got out of nearly a month in the hospital after a emergency spinal surgery. She's been living off a 2nd mortgage interest rate, and social security. Combined was roughly 2,200 per month - my grandparents were/are renting her a back unit on their property for roughly 600/mo (I think). However since recent incidents, they absolutely do not want her going back in there due to it being necessary to climb stairs (her medications make her loopy, and she has fallen before - she cant afford to fall again). In addition, they have just ended the 2nd mortgage situation, so she's losing roughly half the income she was making. But does have the lump sum at her disposal. So about 280k to live off of and roughly 1000 a month from social security benefits (she's 61).   


Now she has incredibly low to no income for rent (any other suggestions for investment to get a reasonable return?? Looking for another deal like what she had with my grandparents). And isn't really being allowed to return to her home. We want to move her down near my brother and I (North San Diego - she's in bay area) but my bro has a full 2bed condo with wife and kid). And I am renting a 1 bedroom (upstairs) unit that is already more than i'd like to pay after having to get a divorce and no one to split rent. I have about 15k in savings, no debt. My brother and sister probably can't help much if at all financially. I'd like to buy a house someday soon, but maybe not in this area (thinking about relocation / new career path, but I do have a good job here now). In addition, my mom needs to be in an area with Kaiser Hospitals.   


What options do my brother and I have to help her? I spoke to a lending officer - buying a house right now is still a bit of a stretch for me and prices are high. Not exactly what I would like to do at the moment (plus living with mom... though it might be a neccesity? ugg).   


Section 8 I think she would qualify for, but wait lists mean that's not a reasonable option in next month or two (years!! Insane!!). Assisted In home living costs are more than we can afford. Assisted living communities also seem to be more than we can likely afford (like 2,500.mo).

I need some advice on what to look into for getting my mom (who can't work and sleeps most of the day - socially, she's not most adequate) a place to live.

So my credit used to be exceptional until a few financial incidents starting mostly last year, most of which were caused by shitty people using my money up (and of course at the time I allowed it until I realized I was dead broke and could barely afford rent, utilities, etc.)

Anywho, my credit score dropped tremendously and I've been researching how to fix it now that I don't have to pay any rent, have more money, and a fairly stable income. It's in the high 400s/low 500s for anyone curious, and most of my low credit comes from unpaid/late student loans, an unpaid eviction on my credit, and an unpaid/late utility bill. 

I tried applying for a few credit cards, one being the CapitalOne secured credit card, but was denied because of the amount of past due payments on my credit and the fact that it has been recent. I am going to negotiate how to pay back a few of the payments tomorrow via a payment plan that I can afford, but in the meantime, are there any suggestions as to how to effectively build my credit back? Also, I don't mind a deposit as long as I know it will effectively build my credit, and high interest rates don't bother me much (but I'd obviously rather have a fairly low interest rate).

The backstory:  My parents are the most abominable financial planners the world has ever seen.  My Dad has made over 200k a year for decades, yet my parents live paycheck to paycheck and have hundreds of thousands in debt. They spent a $50,000 college fund my grandmother left me when she died on a series of lavish beach vacations. I didn't even know I was supposed to have this college fund until I read a letter my grandmother gave me on her deathbed to open when I turned 18. 

My undergraduate education ended up being partially paid for by private, high interest loans cosigned by various dysfunctional family friends and relatives. I naively believed my parents when they told me not to worry about the details and just sign the papers. I am now older and have learned not to trust their financial advice.

The worst of these loans is for $11,500 with an interest rate of 11.125%. I am currently in medical school and the loan is in deferment. The cosigner of the loan, my uncle, recently filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy and the loan was removed from my account, pending resolution of the bankruptcy. My parents deliberately hid this bankruptcy from me to avoid embarrassing my uncle, going so far as to hide letters from the lender informing me of the situation that were mailed to their house.

My husband and I will both have a substantial amount of private and federal debt by the time I graduate medical school. We want to refinance our private loans as soon as possible. Is there any way to do this while my worst loan is tied up in my uncle's bankruptcy? Can we just assume the debt from my uncle and negotiate a settlement of some sort with the lender?",finance

btc,Protect yourself from consumer inflation,"Consumer price inflation

This is relevant for people who have money in reserve for a rainy day, or for some planned expense in the future. I just want to shed light on it with some actual numbers. 

You can also use investment, or diverse funds, but this is for those who have money, and almost everybody have some amount, small or large.

Starting out with USD users. The consumer inflation is 2%, but this is the Fed's preferred rate, and it is important for investors and analysts. The actual rate of price inflation for you and your personal mix of consumer goods and services can be quite different. You can try to estimate it, if you remember, or have accounts of your spending last year. For most people it will be higher, my guess at least 5%, and for some, 10%. All of this depends on your life situation and spending preferences.

We are interested in the future price inflation of course. In smaller countries you can see the USD rate of the local currency change first, then price inflation will come later. Here is an example from South Africa, one of the least backwards countries in Africa: https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/USDZAR. You see that ZAR was 14.24 a year ago, now 15.62. This is a devaluation compared to the USD of 9.7%. Since most smaller countries import a large part of their consumables, this is a driver for local price inflation. It depends on many things, so you can not just add them together.

The reality is that in many countries, you can expect or risk a consumer price inflation of 5 - 20%, and that is not hyperinflation, that is rather a normality.

Now how can you counter it with sound money? I suggest cryptomoney, and my preferred coin is BCH, due to its capacity. We can expect the value of coins to increase by 100% over a year. It did not happen last year and the year before that, but if you look at history, it has been far better, so it is a very real possibility. The volatility is a risk, and you take care of that risk by not having all your savings in crypto.

So how much do you need to have, to counter the risk of inflation of your local currency?

Even with an expected 20% consumer price increase in local currency, You need only 1/5 in crypto.

Example with a save amount of 10000 ZAR:

Local currency down 20% in value: 8000\*20/100 = 1600 (you lose that)
Crypto 2000 up 2000\*100/100 = 2000 (you win that).

Due to all the risk, uncertainty and organic price changes, it is not necessary to find the exact formula.

This example shows that even with a low amount like 20% allocated to crypto, you can completely counter the local currency depreciation.

If you want even less crypto risk, you can diversify between BTC, ETH, BCH, BSV, LTC and ETC, and learn something about those coins. Or you can have a lower allocation, like 10%, it reduces the risk, for a slighly smaller inflation protection effect.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,"USA Tax Time Q: Roth conversion, 1099-R, 8606, my head hurts","TLDR: Did roth IRA conversion in 2019, from a 2017 traditional IRA, part of which didn't convert till 2020. 2019 tax reporting nightmare ensues. Seeking help.

&amp;#x200B;

Hey all,

USA, tax filing time question. I'm using Credit Karma to file taxes this year. While I usually can get everything done easily, I'm really stumping myself with something I did, a traditional to Roth conversion. I know a bit about taxes, but this is above my caliber.

**Background**: My wife and I both work, we fall into the 24% married filing jointly federal tax bracket, have employer-sponsored retirement plans, and have external trad &amp; Roth IRAs on the side. In 2017 I contributed *after-tax* dollars to my traditional IRA ($137) and my wife's traditional IRA ($172). These are the only traditional IRAs we have/had, along with some Roth IRAs. At the time I didn't know it, but when I filed my 2017 taxes with FreeTaxUSA, they generated 8606 forms for both of us that I believe treated these figures as ""nondeductible IRA contributions"" (not that I knew what that meant at the time). I now understand this to mean that I used post-tax dollars to fund a tax-deffered traditional IRA, and *did not* receieve that tax benefit back at that time. I'm still not sure if that's because I *chose* not to recieve the tax benefit, or if it's merely because I was over some income limit to get the benefit. I have since contributed no additional dollars to either of these accounts but they have grown a little bit.

My 2017 8606:

* Line 1 (non-deducible contributions): $137
* Line 3 (sum of 1 and 2, since I took no distribution): $137
* Line 14 (total basis in trad IRAs for 2017 and earlier): $137
* All other lines are blank

Wife's 2017 8606:

* Line 1 (non-deducible contributions): $172
* Line 3 (sum of 1 and 2, since I took no distribution): $172
* Line 14 (total basis in trad IRAs for 2017 and earlier): $172
* All other lines are blank

**Leading up**: I realized in late 2019 that I wanted to do a Roth conversion on both of these accounts. I did this solely for that fact that I had such little amounts in the traditional ones and wanted to consolidate everything into Roth IRAs, for simplicity sake (hah!). At this point, the accounts had grown to $166.96 for me and $214.10 for my wife. I initiated these traditional to Roth conversions in Dec 2019. At the time I did not realize that I had chosen to leave ""reinvestment of earnings/capital gains/dividends"" turned on in the account, as I hadn't even realized this was something I needed to consider (like I said, I'm not an expert). The problem this created is that the majority of the conversion happened in 2019, but not everything. So while the $166.96 and $214.10 did convert in 2019, we both had some residual pennies left in the account in Jan 2020, $0.04 for me and $0.03 for her. The IRA custodian told me that they would eventually sweep those pennies over to the Roth. Here's where I decided to make my life even harder. I allowed my $0.04 to be swept over, but I decided, for whatever reason, to take a premature distribution on my wife's $0.03. So they mailed us a check for $0.03 and we deposited it into our savings account. I would first like to figure out the 2019 tax part. The 2020 tax part will come afterward.

**Today**: I am now sitting here trying to file my 2019 taxes with Credit Karma and I am all sort of messed up about how I am supposed to report any of this. The IRA custodian gave us 1099-Rs for these roth conversions.

My 2019 1099-R:

* Box 1 (gross distribution): $166.96
* Box 2a (taxable amount): $166.96
* Box 2b (taxable amount not determined): ""X""
* Box 7 (distribution code): ""2"" (early distribution, under age, with exception)
* Box IRA/SEP/SIMPLE: ""X""
* All other boxes are blank

Wife's 2019 1099-R:

* Box 1 (gross distribution): $214.10
* Box 2a (taxable amount): $214.10
* Box 2b (taxable amount not determined): ""X""
* Box 7 (distribution code): ""2"" (early distribution, under age, with exception)
* Box IRA/SEP/SIMPLE: ""X""
* All other boxes are blank

After a bit of reading, I think I have learned that these 1099-Rs are not always correct because the custodian may not know if your dollars come in pre-tax or post-tax and they may not know what exactly you are doing with the money. Based on all of my research, I believe these 1099-Rs are incorrect. I believe that box 2a should only be made up of the growth (earnings) since that money needs to be taxed, but the basis (my original investment in 2017) should *not*, since it was funded with after-tax dollars (nondeductible IRA contributions). **IS THIS THINKING CORRECT?** If so, it is as easy as saying that \[my taxable amount = gross distribution - basis\], which would be:

Me: $166.96 - $137 = $29.96

Wife: $214.10 - $172 = $42.10

From here, my impression would be to *pretend* that our 1099-Rs actually say the following, and enter them as such:

My 2019 1099-R:

* Box 1 (gross distribution): $166.96
* Box 2a (taxable amount): $29.96
* Box 2b (taxable amount not determined): thinking this would be un-""X""ed at this point?
* Box 7 (distribution code): ""2"" (early distribution, under age, with exception)
* Box IRA/SEP/SIMPLE: ""X""
* All other boxes are blank

Wife's 2019 1099-R:

* Box 1 (gross distribution): $214.10
* Box 2a (taxable amount): $42.10
* Box 2b (taxable amount not determined): thinking this would be un-""X""ed at this point?
* Box 7 (distribution code): ""2"" (early distribution, under age, with exception)
* Box IRA/SEP/SIMPLE: ""X""
* All other boxes are blank

Is it this easy, or is there some more complicated way I have to figure out what the taxable amount is? I read some stuff on Investopedia about the Pro-Rata rule but my head is spinning, idk what to make of it. All that said, I know that not each tax reporting software treats these things equally. When I get to box 2a in Credit Karma, it says:

""If this distribution is being reported on Form 8606, Nondeductible IRAs, then enter $0 on box 2a.  Information from this 1099R does NOT flow to Form 8606. Entering $0 here excludes this distribution from automatically being reported as income on Form 1040.  Any taxable amount for this 1099R will be calculated on Form 8606 when you enter your nondeductible IRA information.  You'll need to answer the nondeductible IRA questions in the Saving for Retirement section of Credit Karma Tax for Form 8606 to populate as needed.""

I cannot figure out if these means I need to include the $26.96 &amp; $42.10 on Credit Karma's box 2a entry point or not. I am thinking I need to leave it $0, here is why. When I get further down in Credit Karma, there are two additional entry points, one for ""Rollovers or Conversions to Qualified Roth IRAs"" and one for ""Backdoor Roth Entry."" The wording is:

**Rollovers or Conversion to Qualified Roth IRAs**

Amount of distribution rolled over or converted to a qualified Roth IRA (make sure you subtract this amount from box 2a if included there).

**Backdoor Roth Entry**

Amount of distribution rolled over or converted to a qualified Roth IRA (entered above \[*the rollovers or conversions box*\]) that is non-taxable.

From that wording, I believe I would need to leave 2a blank, and put $166.96 &amp; $214.10 in the ""Rollovers or Conversions to Qualified Roth IRAs"" box since that's the full amount rolled over in 2019, and $137 &amp; $172 in the ""Backdoor Roth Entry"" box since that is the portion that is the basis, funded with post-tax dollars, therefor a ""nondeductible IRA contribution.""

There is also a note here that says ""If you received a taxable distribution before you reached the age of 59 1/2 from a qualified retirement plan you may be subject to additional taxes on that distribution. 			If your distribution is exempt from taxes, please visit the Additional Tax on Early Distributions section under Other Tax Items to fill in that information."" I am not yet sure how this play into anything, but I do attempt to factor this in later on. \*\*\*\* Putting this here so you can reference later on.

To experiment, I entered it just as I described above, and Credit Karma then asks me to help them fill out an 8606 for each of us.

1st entry point is ""Enter your total basis in traditional IRAs"" which I believe should be $137 and $172.

2nd entry point is ""Enter non-deductible contributions that were made from January 1, 2020 through April 15, 2020"" which I beleive should be $0.

3rd entry point is ""Enter value of all your traditional, SEP, and SIMPLE IRAs as of December 31, 2019: Enter the total value of all your traditional, SEP, and SIMPLE IRAs as of December 31, 2019, plus any outstanding rollovers. A statement should be sent to you by January 31, 2020, showing the value of each IRA on December 31, 2019. However, if you recharacterized any amounts originally contributed, converted, or rolled over from a qualified plan in 2019, enter on line 6 the total value, taking into account all recharacterizations of those amounts, including recharacterizations made after December 31, 2019."" I am lost on this one. My starting balances on these accounts were $0.04 and $0.03, the residual dividends I mentioned earlier on. I think I would need to put these here? But it also say ""plus outstanding rollovers, so idk if that means I need to make it $0 instead. For this experiment, I entered as $0.04 and $0.03.

4th entry point is ""Enter the net amount you converted from traditional, SEP, and SIMPLE IRAs to Roth IRAs in 2019.  Do not include distributions that you converted to a Roth IRA \[plus some other stuff I think is not relevant\]."" Again, I am lost on this one, but I think it is $0.

5th entry and last entry point is ""Enter the net amount you converted from traditional, SEP, and SIMPLE IRAs to Roth IRAs in 2019"" which I was auomatically carried over from the 1099-R entry points as $166.96 and $214.10.

Putting all that in, Credit Karma increases my Federal taxes by $32, total for wife and me, and increases my state taxes (Indiana) by $7 total. So now I need to decide if $32 tax makes sense for a total taxable amount of $69.06 ($26.96 + $42.10). In my mind, this does not make sense. This seems like an effective federal tax rate of 46%, when our federal rate is 24%. What is wrong here?

So now, I am thinking about that note I mentioned further up, where the \*\*\*\* was. I go to this section of Credit Karma and there is an entry point that says ""Amount of early distributions that can be excluded:"" where I put in $137 &amp; $172, since that is my basis. Doing this result in raising my federal taxes even further, but lowered my state taxes. I'm not convinced that I should be putting that in there.

This is where I am currently sitting. I regret ever doing this, lol. I didn't realize this would be such a nightmare on taxes. I genuinely and wholeheartedly appreciate ANYONE who stuck in there and read this and more so anyone who has any advice on how to handle this. I feel like I'm just within grasp of figuring this out, but I'm afraid to botch it.

**2020 Taxes**: Since on mine, since I did a conversion of $0.04 in 2020, I imagine I will have to go through the same crap over again next tax season. Since my wife had a premature distribution of $0.03, I imagine something slightly difference will have to be done, idk, one battle at a time, just want to figure out 2019 first.

personalfinance,Is it better to have 0 debt or 0 savings?,"So I bought a car a year ago on a 6 year term with an interest rate of 4% and still owe $23k on it. I have 24k in savings, 20k of which I had originally planned to set aside as my official emergency fund. My question is would it be smarter for me to simply pay off the entire car and start my savings from scratch? 

My plan was originally to set the 20k emergency fund aside and begin saving towards a down payment for a house which I would start looking for a year or two down the road. Paying off the car would set all that back to zero but I'd have no debt. I have no student loans or credit card debt.

I make 50k a year and was also planning to start contributing to my employer 401k. My biggest gripe is that I'm in my early 30s and feel like I'm so far behind in savings. I graduated college late and started my career at such a late age also. Any input from you guys would be grateful.

EDIT: Sorry I meant is it better to have savings or 0 savings and 0 debt.

EDIT 2: I am not struggling to pay this car note or make ends meet so my concern is not that I have overbearing debt...it's just don't feel comfortable owing money unless it's like a house. I also don't feel comfortable having no savings. So for those saying to sell the car because I'm way over my head and can't afford to make the payments I'd tell you that's incorrect. Sure maybe I got a car pricier than I should have for my income but it by no means is killing me, I'm still saving month to month as well. 

Lastly, RIP my notifications...this blew up and I wasn't expecting that lol.",finance

personalfinance,Help with 2019 Tax Return - Seized by debt collectors??,"So to cut to the chase my state and federal were both seized by the IRS. I haven't gotten a letter yet for the federal but the letter for the state basically said my return was used to pay a debt. Which was actually paid in full, and the debt is now gone so I'm not .. completely upset about it. Then, I still hadn't received my federal by 2/29 so I checked my status on the IRS website, and got this message "" Your refund has been applied to a past due obligation such as child support, another federal agency debt, or state income tax. The Bureau of the Fiscal Service (BFS), who issues IRS refunds, will send you a notice informing you of the reduction.""

My wife has student loans in default that went into default before we got married. We've tried making payments and for some reason have had to set up payments several times. Nonetheless, we are currently making payments now, so I don't understand why / how it was seized? My only guess is that it's because we filed jointly (my wife doesn't work.. TurboTax recommended this filing status) and I'm beyond frustrated. We have two kids, the total return was almost $6,000 and was meant to be used for our family. I've since refiled to reduce my return and maximize my monthly take home for next year.

Got a locked 30 year conventional loan (255k) at an interest rate of 3.25% (0 points). Our current conventional loan is at an interest rate of 4.35% with 27 years left. 

Closing cost to refinance, excluding prepaid is about 1,700.

Both my wife and I have excellent credit. our home is valued by our broker at 390k. Asked our broker if it’s worth waiting to refinance at a better rate since rates keep going down, but he didn’t seem it was worth it. 

Our goal is to pay off our mortgage ASAP, but still have a safety net for the unexpected. We are thinking of adding an extra $200-$400 a month.

Should we wait to refinance in order to get a better interest rate?

investing,Buying the dip. Are you?,"Is it just me, or hard not to be bullish right now? In my view equities have erroneously priced in potential coronavirus economic impacts. Global markets have fallen in record (literally) fashion on vague information and fear-mongering unscrupulous headlines to say the least, with many unimpacted stocks falling much harder than directly impacted stocks which implies a significant element of panic and irrationality. 

&amp;#x200B;

Sure, China’s PMIs declined to unprecedented levels even compared to the GFC. However, China will inject liquidity easing and policy rate cuts this month to mitigate the economic impact from the Coronavirus - Q2/Q3 will be relentless stimulus season with global balance sheet expansion and rate cuts. The RBA is likely to cut 50bp tomorrow. US treasuries are pricing a 50bp cut for March 17/18th. RBNZ priced to cut 25bp in March, BOJ governor Kuroda pledged to keep high liquidity conditions and BOJ just bought 105bil yen of Japanese ETFs, &amp; BOE says it will “take all needed steps to protect stability”...

&amp;#x200B;

When markets get sold on the unknown, rather than the known, I see that as an auspicious buy opportunity for a long-term hold. Maybe investors were looking for a reason to take profit after a monster Q4 earnings season, and I don’t dispute the negative impacts from supply chains disruptions and stocks should minorly correct accordingly, but indices dropping -13% in a week is insane. Stock prices reflect the next 80+ quarters of earnings, not merely limited to a lacklustre quarter ahead —still, US 10 and 30 years at all-time low yields, 1.077% and 1.646%. The Fed has been transparent they want to boost inflation, and with treasuries real returns capped under 1% and heading towards negative in real terms, holding treasuries is only a defensive/preservation strategy nowadays and investors need growth. When coronavirus inevitably blows over, the world will be left with plenty of monetary and fiscal stimulus, low-interest rates near if not at 0% pa in real terms and equity valuations reflecting that. I can’t see that dynamic changing long term.",finance

Now, since the USD still gives a bit more interest than the EUR which has zero/negative interest, what are people exactly doing right now that makes the USD fall against the EUR? Actually most currencies are falling against the EUR right now despite EUR being a weak currency.

stocks,Forecast 03/02/2020 What to do after last week's decline?,"All over the internet people are giving their advice on what they think the markets will be doing after the sharp decline last week. From the pre-market we can definitely say it will be very volatile.
At the open of the premarket last night the Dow futures went bellow 24900, down more than 500 points. After this initial plunge they started recovering and late in the night in the US, or early morning in Europe when European markets opened, it rose up to 26000, a massive 1100 point swing. This spike was due to Chinese markets performing extremely well, up more than 3%. At the open when the spike hit, the European markets were also sharply up as well. All of this was due to optimism of coordinated Central Bank measures around the world. There were reports last night about the FED cutting rates as soon as this week by 50 bases points.
This positive sentiment turned negative in the later hours and as of 7 30 AM ET,, the Dow is now at 25200, down 800 points in a couple of hours, or down 200 points from Friday’s close. These wild swings were also reflected in the two other indexes, the S&amp;P and the Nasdaq, as well as all major European indexes which are now down more than 1%.
The wild ride continues and it gives a lot of opportunities for day trading, but the risk is extremely high, especially trading futures.
I read a lot of articles during the weekend on people’s thoughts where the market can go and is this the bottom, is it time to buy the dip, can this week bring another significant drop and so on. What I learned is people way over complicate their thinking and figure out ways to rationalize their decisions regardless if it is wright or wrong.
When I analyze the market In times like this there is only one thing I ask myself: What is the probability of good news hitting the market and what is the probability of bad news coming out?

On the up side the Central Banks can lower the rates, which is highly probable. The sub question to this is: Will people go out to restaurants, malls, events etc. if there is a virus outbreak but the rates are very low? This is more of a rhetorical question, the Central Banks lowering rates does in no regard resolve the current situation, the panic that is being shared among people and you can be giving free money away, no one will come to get them if their life is on the line.

On the down side, more cases are reported every hour all around the world and the number of reported cases is no longer the problem, but the wide spread of the virus is. People’s mentality kicks into effect and they get more and more worried. So the probability of bad news coming out is not even a probability but a certainty.

This is why I recommend either getting PUT options or just sit on the side lines until this thing clears. There is still a long way to go until we know the economic impact of this outbreak. Meanwhile the algorithms have no problem selling of another 10% and no retail or value investor can compete with the size and volume of the computerized traders.

personalfinance,Wealth Management firm or,"Edit: didn't finish the title lol. Wealth management firm or index funds?

Hi all. I've been reading PF for a few months now and it has helped me start to take charge of my finances. I'm looking for some advice on how to start investing.

I'm 23, no debts, living a weird itinerant lifestyle since graduating college for which I have no housing costs (housing across the US provided by seasonal jobs in my field or occasional brief stints at home). This has made it easy to create an emergency fund and start saving money in a Roth IRA, MoneyMarket savings, and various CDs. I do all my banking with Navy Federal and all my accounts are associated with them.

I plan to go for a Master's in the next 1-2 years through a (grant- or scholarship-funded!) program and make the jump to living somewhere with rent, getting an advanced degree, and looking for a higher-paying permanent position. So, I want to keep some money relatively liquid for use in grad school.

I've also come into some money in the past few years through deaths in the family. We are talking in the ballpark of $20k here to invest. My parents use a wealth management firm called Hemington who told my parents that their children can put money there with no minimum (parents, their cousins, and my step-siblings all use the firm). Parents also said the firm charges \~1% charge per year. The firm is fee-only and advises in a fiduciary capacity.

What is the difference between using a wealth management firm like this vs putting money in index funds in a more DIY approach? Is a 1% charge too high for it to be worth it with this amount of money? Any other recommendations?",finance

gaming,Rockstar should make a 1930's gangster game loosely based around the exploits of the Barker Gang.,"I think Rockstar's attention to world detail remains unparalleled to this day, and although I don't want to see them become devs that do period pieces just for the sake of doing period pieces, I *do* believe that the Prohibition Era and romanticized gangster era of the United States is just begging to receive the Rockstar treatment. 

The closest we've come is LA Noire or the moonshine bits in RDO. I would like to see a proper Red Dead-level title focused on a bit of time in the late 1920's/early 1930's, robbing banks, running liquor, engaging in various other gang activity, strung together by a narrative somewhat like the Barker Gang's story. There were definitely some Barker Gang influences in RDR2's story, but I want the whole hog.

From Wikipedia: 

&gt;The **Barker–Karpis Gang** was one of the longest-lived criminal gangs during the [Depression Era](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depression_Era), spanning from 1931 to 1935. The gang was founded by [Fred Barker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Barker) and [Alvin Karpis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alvin_Karpis), and later joined by Fred's brother [Arthur ""Doc"" Barker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Barker). Along with the three core members, the gang's network spanned up to 25 members at one point.  
&gt;  
&gt;Although not as well known as their contemporaries the [Dillinger Gang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dillinger_Gang), or the [Barrow Gang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrow_Gang), the Barker-Karpis Gang was perhaps more ruthless, not only committing bank robberies, but also extending the activities into kidnapping.[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barker%E2%80%93Karpis_gang#cite_note-Burrough,_Bryan_2009-1) It is best known for the myth that it was run by the Barker brothers' mother, Kate, usually referred to as ""[Ma Barker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ma_Barker)"".

So, give this story the Rockstar treatment. You're a part of a gang family that is just starting out. The matriarch of the family is sort of the mastermind, and the brothers are very, very dangerous people. You're not blood related but fall in with the gang until you realize just how ruthless they really are and how out of control everything is going - but, you can't simply walk away. 

With the feds on the trail and the brothers sure to make you suffer if you try to leave, you're trapped between a rock and a hard place, going through motions to affirm your loyalty to the brothers while still trying to avoid partaking in the more ruthless actions, and staying under the radar of the feds, while ultimately plotting your grand escape - and possibly the destruction of the gang entirely. You're not a good man, but you know that you can't survive life with the gang, so you'll do what you need to do in order to get away with your life. And that means cutting deals, laying traps, double crossing, espionage, subterfuge... and chaos.

Open world exploration with more realistic underpinnings like Red Dead 2 in a fictional city based on Chicago and the surrounding small towns and rural areas. People will draw connections to Mafia, of course, because of the setting and some game play elements such as vehicles using fuel and so on - but that's just going to have to be something people will get over. Mafia's existence shouldn't prevent Rockstar from creating a game that is orders of magnitude more in depth and amazing. 

Vehicles would include your standard variety of 1934 and older vehicles... passenger cars, farm trucks, large trucks, emergency vehicles, taxi cabs, throw in some race cars and hot rods, some modified/armored bank robbing or liquor-running vehicles. Some 1920's air planes might even be available. 

Unlike GTA, the game play would not be focused around driving - driving would be treated more like horse riding in Red Dead, an essential part of life and an activity that requires care rather than the care-free chaos of pinballing down GTA's streets and spending a few hundred bucks to erase the damage. Cars are slower and easier to control for the most part, but won't stand up to damage the way they do in GTA. Blown tires will make them hard to control and draw attention from police.

personalfinance,Should I re-finance my mortgage for a lower interest rate?,"I bought my first home in Jan 2019 and was locked in @ 5.125% with an FHA loan, 30 years fixed. The original loan amount was for $140,400 and my current balance is $138,189, so I've paid it down only a couple thousand dollars. My taxes and insurance are escrowed in.

I was contacted with an offer to refinance @ 3.625% FHA, same loan terms (30 years fixed)... but due to closing costs and all that fun stuff, it would actually raise my balance to $143,420.

Now, I do plan to stay in this house long-term so I know it probably makes sense to refinance... but it's hard for me to stomach seeing the mortgage balance increase to above where it was even initially, and quite honestly I'm not sure if the lower interest rate is appealing enough to make it worthwhile yet. It would lower my monthly mortgage payment by just over $100 which isn't too bad, but still... I hate seeing that principal balance increase by $5k.

I'm wondering what you guys would do in my shoes or if you have any advice or insight. This is all new to me and I just want to make sure I'm not doing anything dumb.",finance

personalfinance,"Moving from an apartment to a house, have questions on some of the numbers","Hey everyone,

So I'll make this quick. I'm thinking of moving from an apartment to a house in my area. I have decided that I want more space and to be able to build some equity. I'll provide a break down really quick of what my finances are currently vs what they would be:

Current rent is $1180 including all utilities. It's a flat rate at the end of the month. All other expenses (car payment, insurance, student loans, etc) are under 50% of my total take home after taxes which is roughly $3800/month

The mortgage I am looking at would be $1052, not including utilities but includes PMI, homeowners insurance, and taxes based on an interest rate of 5% (I know that is high but I always estimate higher). With utilities I expect that bill to climb to around $1300/month (I could rent a room for roughly $500/month to supplement some of this). This would bring all of my expenses to around 53% of my total monthly income after taxes.

I feel like I have done a decent amount of research, but a house is a huge financial decision and I don't want to fall into the trap of being ""house poor."" Does anyone have any advice on other things I should consider/look into? Would anyone feel comfortable going in with these numbers?

personalfinance,Should I start a 529 if my kids are already in middle and high school?,"I currently have 2 kids...in 7th and 9th grade.  I currently have about 100K reserved for their schooling sitting in a high yield savings account.  I had always kept it there instead of a 529 because I was getting mid to high 2% interest and I wanted to keep it as liquid as possible.  

But, as of late, the interest rate on that account has been dropping pretty drastically over the past year.  I believe it is down to low 1s.  I've thought about shopping around for another HY savings account, but the most I can seem to find is high 1s, low 2s.  So I was thinking about moving a portion of it into a 529, but I'm wondering if it's too late, and if market fluctuations could end up hurting me in the short term, especially with the way the market is looking now and how overdue we are for a correction.

There are no guarantees in a 529, if I'm not mistaken, and I could actually lose money in the short run.  I also live in CA and you can't deduct a 529 from taxes.

Just wondering if it's even worth it to move it to a 529 or just find the best HYS account and stick it in there.

On a side note, I don't know how much a 529 affects scholarship opportunities.  We are relatively high income earners, as a household, but both my daughters excel in school.  Can a 529 somehow prevent a student from earning a merit based scholarship or will that not be a factor?

personalfinance,[Canada/Quebec] Changing job at the end of maternity leave affecting last payment,"As the title says, it's for Canadian/Quebec employment laws.

Wife is currently on maternity leave, ends on march 6th. Her 1st day back at work is march 9th. On Feb 18th, she informed her current (now ex) employer that she will not be returning as she had a better offer elsewhere. She had an agreement with her boss to end the employment on march 6th/9th not to hurt her maternity leave pay from RQAP.

VP Finance decided to terminate her on the spot and pay her vacation pay on feb 28th. This literally makes her lose her lay payment from maternity leave. The VP is hiding behind the federal law that she had 5 business days to fill out the record of employment, while provincial employment rules are leaning on the freedom of interpretation about the situation. Right now, it's a mix bag of conflicting rules and lack of knowledge from call centers between RQAP, Federal and Provincial employment laws.

 Wife and VP are going back and forth over email, but, according to RQAP, the ex-employer should be able to reverse the payment from the 28th and correct the situation fast enough not to block the last mat leave payment.

I don't have any contacts in HR that could prove reliable, and wife's ex employer doesn't have an HR department.

* No other debt

Relevant Assets

* Retirement is covered - we max out 401k contribution each year and are still in our 40's
* We have $50k in cash savings account that has been our emergency fund

My wife and I both are in very enviable job standing:

Me: I've been at my company 20 years, was recently promoted. My job security is excellent but even if I were to be laid off it would be with a severance package that would be approximately $50k.

We have a little over 2 years left of payments on the vehicle. I was perfectly fine with just continuing to pay the $400 per month given the relatively low interest rate and it would be paid off right when my kid was entering college, but am hearing that any amount over $30k in my savings will result in a higher expected financial contribution (i.e., college net cost).

So all in I am only about 2200 dollars.

I plan on paying all of these off next week. I plan to just look on my credit report and call the collections agencies and pay what I owe. Are there any strategies to this to possibly pay less than the total amount? Can I negotiate with them?  Also, after I pay the debt, how do I go about getting it removed from my report? Is it even beneficial to my score and credit opportunities to pay them off if I cannot get them removed? When I get rejection letters the main factor seems to be the open collections. Will simply paying what I own and not having them completely removed help at all?

I am looking to get my score into the 700’s as I am tired of getting turned down for financing for things, and paying exorbitant interest rates on the loans I do get. Any tips or tricks on this type of thing would be greatly appreciated!

personalfinance,Need direction as to where to go next. Part-time college student and full-time PCT trying to pay off debt and build more savings while living paycheck to paycheck.,"Edit: I spend $75 per paycheck on food, not per month! My bad. 

Hi all, I'm a 25F part-time college student, full-time patient care tech in an emergency room. Money has never been my strong point, but I am trying to get there.

Currently, I make about $28,400 before taxes. I am contributing to a 403b Fidelity, I also have vision, dental, health insurance, and a life insurance policy as well. Being an independent student, I was able to obtain federal grants and stipends for college but had to take out $750 and pay $500 out of pocket to cover the rest of my tuition.

At this point, this is where I get a little lost

**The Good:**

My 2019 tax return was $1,300.

I recently held an online yard sale and made $600.

My personal loan for my Certified Medical Assistant license has **2** payments left, so an additional $169 can go towards savings and paying off debt faster.

I do not have a car payment and the insurance for my vehicle is $50 a month.

The bad:

My savings are currently at about $150.  Ideally, I would like to put as much money into savings as I can. And before you ask, yes; I am under a lot of financial panic should I need a large sum of money fast.

$2,100 in credit card debt.

$ 1,075 private student loan.

$15,000 in federal student loans from a prior run with college (it did not go well, but that's a different story for a different day). The good is that the hospital I work for is non-profit, and I have switched my payments to a consolidation program for non-profits and my payments are income-based. I know I can put my payments in forbearance while I am in school, but I would prefer to keep paying off the huge sum of money while I can. I will probably carry this debt until I die, I am aware.

**Monthly Expenses:**

Rent: $665.00

Electricity: $25.00

Heat: $15.00

Car/renters insurance: $50.00

Phone plan: $100.00

Credit Card: $125.00, this is not the minimum payment; the minimum payment is $65 but I am personally choosing to pay more so I can pay this off quicker.

Personal loan: $169.00 2 payments left on it! :D

Private student loan: $25.00

Federal Student Loan on IDR and consolidation: $30.00

Groceries: $75.00 per paycheck, $150 per month

Pet finances: $50.00 (I keep $10 to the side for their yearly vet visit. I do all of their medical care besides their rabies shot, which saves $75 per year on them)

Gas for my car: $60.00 per month. I have a short commute to both work and school.

Monthly added up: $1,364ish. I make $1,530 each month. Not ideal, and things are understandably tight.

I guess what I am getting at is what I should do with my tax return and online yardsale extra money. I need to build more savings, which is hard since I live paycheck to paycheck.

My mom was also approved for a parent plus loan for the last 3 semesters of my schooling, so we agreed that we’d accept those loans with the understanding that I’d pay them off despite them being in her name. The parent plus loan is 18,800 at around 7% interest. So total student loan debt is 51,800.

My mom is allowing me to live at home with no rent payment as she did with my older brothers, but I would like to move out by next year, Jan 2021. She also covers my food expenses when I eat home, I cover any personal eating out. So for the next 10 months, my only hard monthly payments are car payment (207.30), car insurance (177.80), gym (10.00), amc a-list (23.95), and one-drive storage (7.60). Total of $426.65 of monthly payments. This leaves me with 3112.73 a month. Of course I have other expenses such as gas and eating out, problem is I’m wondering how much of my money I should be dedicating to such things over the next 10 months (I would like to dedicate some money to misc purchases and eating out for example). Also, I’m wondering what ratio of my monthly income should go to a savings account and what should go towards student loans. I would like to pay off the parent plus loan first as it has the highest interest rate. I was originally thinking since I am living rent free I should take advantage of that while I can and just pay as much as I’m able towards the loans while also putting some other income in a savings account (I don’t even have a savings account, any bank recommendations are welcome! I have chase for checking). 

So for example I was thinking I could pay 1,500 a month towards loans, 1,000 towards a savings account, and be left with around 600 for misc purchases, which I think I will not need all of as I don’t eat out much and don’t buy myself too many personal items.

Hey guys,

I've got a stupid problem.

Because some online tax services surprise you at the last minute, it has taken me several attempts to find a service. Apparently, I finally found one, and it only filed my federal taxes and not my state (probably an error on my part, admittedly). Anyways, I was under the impression that my taxes did not go through a few weeks ago. I try to use another service and get the notification that my federal taxes have already been filed. I was a bit panicked, checked my bank account, and saw that the federal return was in my bank account - so that was good.

However, I need to file my state taxes as well. For the life of me (even through e-mail correspondence, etc.) I cannot find the online service I used. I don't remember the name of it because they are all similar. Is there any easy way any of you know of that I can figure this out or remedy this by just submitting state only taxes?

Edit:

Clearing things up based on comments:

\- This was a few weeks ago, so my e-mail deletes trash after a week or so.

\- I've tried two more services and try to just file ""state only"" but they required a federal return before they could proceed to a state return. I presume this is the norm unless anyone knows otherwise?

Bitcoin,"I just don’t foresee mass adoption of bitcoin. When the federal bank started issuing paper money in the United States, many people were outright distrustful of it. People were","... counterfeiting the paper notes all the time. Different types of notes were used (in ways comparable to alt coins) and it was decidedly difficult for commoners to evaluate their currency with confidence. Eventually it got to the point where congress-issued paper notes were “not worth a Continental” a commonplace term. 

I’m not a historian, but I know some presidents were even elected, in part, on the basis that they would sort out the financial system (Andrew Jackson) who fought for the “common man.” 

I compare investing in bitcoin now to buying paper money - at the fraction of its stated value - with more “trustworthy” gold during the early 19th century, hoping one day it will be an easily verifiable, stable form of currency. But hardly anyone did that, and even if they did in the early stages, the currency evolved to the point where the form they bought wasn’t even worth anything. 

Only when the government took action and backed the notes with their power and authority (which rules over the immediate, every day lives of the common man) did people start accepting and exchanging paper money with confidence.  

The government redefined united states notes as “legal tender”—bills that were legally required to be accepted when presented in payments.  And not accepting was punishable by law. 

Until this happens and the government backs a particular digital currency as the de facto solution - I don’t see the general population or the common man taking to bitcoin the way it would need to happen. In order for something decentralized to take precedent, billions would have to come to a consensus or the authorities where those billions shop, retailers, institutes etc. 

Right now and for the last decade there has been a positive movement in forming that consensus, by educated tech savy individuals. But what happens when the pendulum swings back and the normal people don’t adopt. I fear many of the forward thinking people of bitcoin might be willing to give up the ground they took and the price will drop, big time.

On the other hand, if bitcoin did dig its feet into the ground and it eventually functioned as an everyday currency, it would have the potential to flip the entire wealth pyramid on its head. Essentially, smart, forward-minded (potentially poor) people could be become immensely wealthy just by buying one bitcoin early in its run. A wealthy man’s 250k could in essence be equal to a poor mans 3k in early 2017. I cant see the people in power or the wealthy enforcing that paradigm, and thats what history has shown us needs to happen. Authoritative enforcement. Maybe the internet (global community) is that authority. But there are still too many voices on the internet that look to the gov’t for the rules.

Im not trying to offend anyone. Im just ruminating on paper. I want bitcoin to be successful, I just cant circumnavigate this idea in my mind. Genuinely curious about counter positions.

He does not have a degree or any kind of specialized training. Because of the freelance work, which takes around 60 hours per week when he is busy, he does not want to get a minimum wage job. We disagree on this point but I can't make him look for employment. Ultimately, I have reached the point where I am just trying to salvage the situation on my own.

We currently have about $2000 left in the bank and (by my calculations) will squeak through this month with $24 leftover.

I have about $13,000 in a retirement fund, I believe I would receive about $8,000-$9,000 after early withdrawal penalties and whatever else is deducted. This would close the income gap for up to 5 months (if we just stop paying our credit card bills and maybe skip a mortgage payment)

Our mortgage payment is too high. We have only been in the house for 5 years and many things need to be repaired, repairs will cost between ($5,000 and $8,000). I don't believe we can sell without repairing it at this point. The balance is $215,000, When we bought it 5 years ago it was appraised at $240,000. Our market is slightly up but, like I said, there are a lot of repairs including obvious (though mild) foundation issues. Even if we could sell, I'm not sure we can afford to rent a truck and move our furniture, or first and last month's rent.  We can't take out a home equity loan, I checked. We could look into refinancing but our interest rate is 4% so I don't think refinancing would lower the payment. *I am willing to look into all of this if you all think I should though*.  A large chunk ($300 per month) is going to repay an escrow overage of $2500 from a change in insurance. If we can pay that off our payment will go down to about $1800 per month. We also now pay a $54 per month late fee because we are a month behind. The lender does not have any kind of deferment system and said that they will begin foreclosure procedures when 2 months' payment are missed.  Rental prices in our area vary widely. Because we have 3 children and 2 pets I estimate that we would need to pay between $1000 (if we surrender the pets) and $1800 for a place with at least 2 bedrooms. I'm not sure we'd be approved on my income alone, again, I am willing to look into this option.

We have no health insurance either so, if anyone gets sick I don't know what we will do.

On the bright side, our cars are paid off. I am starting a new position in August and hope to make an additional $1000 - 1500 per month, I won't know for sure how much until April.

We've made some terrible choices to get us into this spot. There are so many things I wish I had done differently. I am so scared for our kids and I just don't see an end in sight. Is there anything I can do to turn it around? Should we pursue selling the house? Put the retirement money towards repairs and then sell hoping to make some money back? Try to eek through? Walk away? Something else? Thank you for any advice.

Business Expenses $300

\*Updating to address some questions and also to thank you all so much for your advice! I need to hear the tough stuff. I know we did this to ourselves, we have let our family down. I am willing to make a change. 

I am trying to avoid being too specific because I am so embarrassed about our situation. We both rely on the internet for income which is why we haven't cut it. I work from home because our youngest is not school-aged yet. 

 \- Regarding the business expenses: I'm not sure, my partner (we are married) handles the finances although he is open about them and I can access the bank account balance. This is what he has listed in our monthly budget for operating his business.  Both of the credit cards are under $10,000, one is maxed out, the other is close we have a Home Depot card with about $2,000 on it. I don't know the interest rates. 

 \- The gas amount is high, we have a minivan and we have to make a two-hour drive once a week when I work away from home. Sometimes my partner has to meet with his clients. We also drive the children to school every day, too and from the store, friends houses, we were gifted a membership to the zoo as well so we go there about once a week to make up for the stuff my kids can't afford to do with their friends. Typing it all up, it does seem high, I will look into it. 

 \- Groceries: We can cut back, I think we are living in denial. I will get it down to $100 per week. 

 \- Mortgage: $300 per month escrow payback, $700 monthly interest, $ 700 escrow (which does include PMI) and $450 to principle, plus the $54 late fee. 30 yr fixed loan

 \- I am canceling Youtube TV and Netflix today. 

 \- Regarding Other: Last month we spent: 

$40 on haircuts  - all three kids, we do this about every 6 months

$15 on new shoes for the littlest due to larger feet, 

$40 for Girl Scout dues

$50 deposit for a summer camp the rest of which is being paid through a donation, $30 for two birthday parties

$8 for ice cream

$25 Honor society dues

$30 for Valentine's and parties

$15 for a spirit night fundraiser

$10 for Girl Scout cookies

$110 for a new tire

$30 for an oil change and I set aside $40 to pay the registration for one of the cars next month. 

We budget this each month and I am in charge of budgeting, I save whatever I can which is currently about $500.  This is in addition to the $2000 mentioned earlier in the account. I was not trying to obfuscate this amount, I worry about applying it to debt and bills because I want to have money to take the kids to the doctor, pay for unexpected expenses and whatnot. 

It's hard because things come up like, my kids having friends over and our friends wanting to get together, school is always needing this and that and I feel like it impacts the ability for the children to maintain friendships. For example, we were invited to a museum near our house with a friend who has a membership, they will get us in but the parking is $10. I am always telling people that we can meet after lunch because I know I can't buy food while we are out. It's still too much. Looking back and trying to justify this expense has really opened my eyes. Everything counts, there is not even $10 that we can waste. It doesn't feel significant to spent $20-$30 here and there but it adds up and, as u/mreed911 correctly pointed out, had we not spent this money each month we would have had enough for a mortgage payment. 

I will cut down on these. Next month I have one event for $25, my nieces birthday gift which I've budgeted $30 and my daughter's birthday which I've budgeted $50.  I have already explained to the children that we are not getting them presents this year, the $50 is to have two friends over, feed them and make a cake. I can get it done for $25 I think. 

With the reductions, I can reduce the budget to $4676. 

I will get a realtor to come by and look at the house.

What do I do?

personalfinance,Worth refinancing my house?,"Hi guys,

&amp;#x200B;

I've been seeing a lot of posts regarding home refinancing and was wondering if we're in a position to refinance our house.

We got married back in November and my wife purchased the house shortly before we met 3 years ago now.

Details:

\-Home: 133k valuation in a fairly stable market (slightly up but not crazy obviously)

\-Loan amount: 117k left (124k initial)

\-Interest rate: 4.625% on 30-yr fixed and we pay PMI that totals out to around 1k a year.

\-I've been looking at rates if we were to consider refinancing and the lowest I could find was a 2.625% 15-yr fixed.

I understand we're not at the 20% cap to be able to refinance yet, but I have the ability to come up with 10-20k to reach that threshold if this is worth it (stock investments).

My wife and I make around 95k/year gross. We've started budgeting and we have plenty of excess funds each month to absorb another couple hundred dollar increase to our budget without giving up much in the way of our life - maybe one less trip a year etc.

As far as I understand the fees would be around $400 (upfront costs advertised) to refinance through a credit union? This is the part I have no knowledge on, this is just what the website says. From what I've seen refinancing usually costs somewhere in the thousands of dollars.

Our plan is to live in this house for maybe another 2 years before we move if the job lets me.

Let me know what you think and if I've left anything out!

personalfinance,Options for refinancing my private student loans,"I currently have some private student loans. Right now, the balance is $15,400 at 4.2% variable with a payment of about $110 per month, but I'm paying $120. The payoff for the min payment would be 16 years and 1 month and the payoff for what I am paying now is 14 years and 3 months. Since this is variable, the rate has been as low as 2.5% and as high as 5.1%. Nothing too drastic, but it does fluctuate.

I have been thinking about refinancing these into a fixed rate, fixed term loan. I checked out Education Loan Finance (ELFI) and I got pre-approved for a 10 year loan at 4.05%. The monthly payment would be about $157, which I can afford. If I went with 5 year or 7 year loan, I could get a lower rate, but I would be cautious about the increased payment. For example, if I went with a 7 year term, it would drop the interest rate by 0.1% but the monthly payment would go up about $50 to $210. I know going from $110 to $210 per month isn't that big of a difference, but money is tight and I like to keep my monthly minimum payments low while having the option to pay more each month if I wanted to.

So, should I go ahead and refi with ELFI at 4.05%? I'm leaning towards yes. Are there any other private student loan refi options out there?

Thanks in advance.",finance

personalfinance,Debt Consolidation Assistance. Need help deciding best way to get out of debt.,"Hey Reddit,  I was hoping someone could take the time to review my finances and let me know how I should be proceeding. I think I've got this figured out,  but rather have other opinions. I'll list my income and debts below.   

Income: $4,520 Monthly After Taxes.  

Bills:  
Rent - $2007.  
Renters Insurance - $13.  
Electric - $260.  
Cell Phone - $183.  
Car Insurance - $180.  
Car Payment - $566.  
Gas - $90.  
Subscriptions - $64.  
Minimum Credit Card Payments - $187.   
Total: $3550.  

Roommate pays $500.  
Total monthly cost to me: $3050.  

I have $7175 in credit card debt. I tried to apply for debt consolidation loan to cover the total but was only approved for $3000. The interest rate was 17.75% through a credit union. Is it worth taking this amount to pay off 5 credit cards? This would lower my minimum payments by $125. Would I also be able to refinance my car at this time as well because my score would go up? I've made on time payments for my car for a little over a year. This would theoretically save me another $100. I'll be getting an extra $2260 in May, which would payoff 1 more card and half of my last card.  

If this was too confusing, my apologies. I believe it's worth to take the 3,000 because it'll save me $225 a month. Then once the windfall hits in May, I'll be essentially credit card debt free.

So I financed a later model used car through a dealership with an outrageous interest rate like 20% or something. My plan was to overpay to pay down the principle and avoid the interest.

The payment was 250/mo and over half of it was going to interest for several months before I overpayed $1000, 800 of which took a chunk out of the principle 

After that I had no payments due for several months.

Last month was the first payment I had due since and it was 20 some dollars.

I overpayed again paying 100.

Then I just checked my account and it now says the last payment DUE was 100. Which is a lie because I remember specifically the last payment DUE was only 20 and change. I presume only a portion of any given payment CAN be interest and at least some of every payment MUST go to principle. So only a portion of that 20 should have been interest and the rest, plus ALL 80 I payed over the amount due should have gone to the principle!

But not only is the record showing that the last payment due was 100 instead of 20, it's ALSO saying all 100 went to interest with not one penny paying down the principle.

What the HELL is going on here and what can I do about it???

It's also saying the current amount due is back up to 200 most if not all of which will probably be taken as interest if I pay it.

When I should be enjoying another several months of no payment due since I, in fact over payed the last due by a factor of 5!!!",finance

I ran through my share of cars and lost a lot of money that way. I also ran up my credit cards with vacations and food. Now, I'm about to join the military. I'll only make about 2k a month give or take before taxes, life insurance, and retirement plans. My wife won't have a job, at least not right away. Together we are paying damn near 1300k a month just in debt. That doesn't count our rent, utilities and food. It's been pretty hard to get by. The good news is, I won't have to worry about paying rent with the military since they will supply me housing. But even still, it will be really hard to get by given one debt to income ratio. About 25k of my debt is my car loan. I'm about 7k upside down on the loan as is. For anyone unfamiliar with the Civil service relief act, I can call all the creditors I acquired a loan through before I joined the military, and they will have to lower my interest rate to 6%. Even still though, the debt will take me years to get out of, where as I feel as if i could file for chapter 7 and just save that money over the next few years during my service. I'm only 22 years old. I really dont have many assets. She has a car that's already paid off in her name but it's only worth like 3k. If I did file bankruptcy, should I 'sell' the car to a family member before I actually file for bankruptcy? Also, filing for bankruptcy can affect your security clearance and I'm currently unsure what my job will be. I've heard a lot of military members just keep their superiors updated on the situation and it usually doesnt affect your clearance, especially considering if the debts weren't acquired from something like gambling. I would appreciate any ideas or opinions on what I should do. The idea of joining the military and just filing chapter 7 and being debt free entices me because they will provide my housing so it's not like I really have to worry about finding a place to rent that will check my credit history for the next few years. I feel like with a dedicated budget I could save at least 35k over the next 4 years in the military. But is bankruptcy worth all of it or should I try to climb out?

- The stock market is at record highs because there is quite literally nowhere else to put one's money

At 30 years old, I just began being on my own. My wife and I recently came back to the States almost 3 years ago after trying to get started in Panama but ultimately decided to try it in the states. We are currently waiting for her migratory status to change and hoping that it does change sometime this year.

Here are all the facts:

I am currently in $52,761 in debt. Which include:

$43,694 in student loans spread across 11 small loans between $1,156 and $9,103.16 at between 3.4%, 4.66% and 6.8% interest rate.

2 credit cards currently in collections, $1,289 and $2,318

2 credit cards with about $400 in debt which I'm currently paying off as my paychecks come in.

1 auto loan of about $2,400 left which I'll be paying off as soon as my tax return come in and 1 auto loan of $5,060 which has been written Bad debt profit and loss write-off.

Our living expenses are we both make about 2k every 15 day. We are looking to move where we are in due to the living situation not being suitable at all, rent is $1,100 and looking to increase that by an extra $100 or 2. I am currently going to school to make a career change at the moment. Wife has almost no debt as she is starting with one credit card and getting about half the limit and paying it off.

My question is, should I start paying off the collections first including or excluding the auto loan that has been written off? Pay the loans as is as a whole or one loan at a time (highest or lowest first?) or should I attempt to get a loan to pay everything off and just work at paying everything off and pay that loan over time. Any advice would be greatly appreciated and any probing questions would be answered with not issues.

More detail: This is a fairly remarkable point in history. The recent outbreak has garnered more attention than any other major public health threat since 2008, according to my Google search analysis ([https://imgur.com/a/FnWc4bR](https://imgur.com/a/FnWc4bR) ). China's large share of world GDP and the globalization of supply chains are reasons why we shouldn't gloss over coronavirus. In my view, global economic activity and earnings growth could take a heavy hit, albeit temporarily, due to the containment efforts of governments and corporations. We already saw a sharp tumble in Chinese manufacturing activity on Sunday, in fact the worst since the global financial crisis. While textbooks tell us that the stock market is a discounting mechanism looking far into the future, I believe investors are near sighted. With that said, a 10-15% selloff isn't the worst we could see. Furthermore, last week's repricing only brings the S&amp;P 500 index level back to where it was in October 2019 - not bad at all. U.S. stocks somewhat rebounded this Monday on hopes for central bankers to come and save the day with rate cuts. I highly doubt monetary policy is an effective solution in this event - while the Fed can provide market liquidity, they cannot mobilize people to travel and get on planes. While I expect some policy intervention, I don't believe central bankers will cut as much as investors want them to, which could be a headwind for stocks.",finance

personalfinance,Is it common to have different lock dates for interest rates and closing cost during refinancing,"I recieved my loan estimate yesterday and it has rate lock until 04/02. However,  I also see ""all closing cost estimates and lender credits expires on 03/15"". 

Is this some kind of catch or this is normal? My rates and closing cost seems to good to be true, APR: 3.28%, closing cost: $300. 

My current loan has rate of 4.3% and new loan if approved,  will reduce my monthly installments by $450 or so. 

I have 750+ credit score,  low debt [$4k in credit cards] . Lender said under-writing is initiated.

I'm obviously going to call them and see what is going on with this but i feel like i just got kicked in the chest as I just now have been getting my credit up to a somewhat decent place and this is going to f*** my financial plans up for quite a while. I never received any notice by mail of this debt in the past 8 years and saw nothing on my credit report so I thought I finally had all of my old debts paid off.

How should i go about getting this cleared up? I never took a loan from the school itself just the federal loans which have been paid off. Was never even aware that I supposedly owed the school money for anything. If I do end up owning them the money it won't be the end of the world but how can a nearly $4000 debt be owed for this long and I wasnt even aware it existed.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.

The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

stocks,It’s just a dead bat bounce.,"Half of the workers in our economy are women. Many of them have children. In the near future, daycare centers (and schools) will begin to close to prevent the spread of disease. During that time, women will become highly unproductive to the economy [insert joke about women ever being productive here]. It isn't a matter of if, but when. 

Additionally, consumer goods stock is dwindling in warehouses all across the country, as are supplies and materials for assembly and manufacturing. Just because something is ""made in the USA"" doesn't mean its components are. There is a significant lag time between when the shipping lanes stopped moving goods (and Chinese factories scaled back) to when the supply shock hits the US.

Today's bump in market prices was speculation over Fed rate hikes by the media to shake retail investor's puts out of the market. The media is owned by very rich people who leverage uncertainty by creating predictable market gyrations and profiting from them. That is what happened today and will continue to happen. Don't panic into the market during the next few weeks unless you want to lose money. Do not buy back into the market as a retail investor until after daycare centers have begun closing. Some time after that is when the bottom will be found.

People should remember that for the first half of Feb the stock market remained elevated, even though everyone had access to the information that plainly showed China was a total mess. The market does not act timely, and it doesn't always take all information into account, it is a herd of humans behaving more like a swarm, and it isn't as intelligent as many like to pretend. If you flash a bright light at a swarm you can influence its flight path, the same is true of the market when flashed with media headlines. The fundamentals don't lie.

Bitcoin,Bitcoin gift idea for no coiners,"Just thought I’d share a neat concept I used to gift bitcoin to friends/family members on their birthday or Christmas which was received rather well and generated a lot of interest. Use a [mockup certificate ](http://www.pixeden.com/misc-print/psd-print-certificate-template#) to create a “bitcoin gift card” which displays the amount you are gifting (in bitcoin, since the value fluctuates) to the name of the person. You can add other elements like the coin name (Bitcoin of course, but I’ve done it for Litecoin also since a family member already had BTC), add the coin symbol etc to make it look more quirky. Add a QR code that [links to a reliable source ](https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet) that explains how the gift holder can create a wallet of their choice without being mislead. Once the gift holder acknowledges that they are ready to receive their token, you ask for their address and send over a test transaction to confirm that they’re doing it right. Then send over their gift funds. Interest sparked. Creative gift idea compete. If they don’t create a wallet you simply hold their funds on their behalf until they are ready to receive / might even want to cash out instead - of course you insist that they don’t cash out and explain the HODL wisdom.

Edit: Once you’ve mocked up the certificate I’d  personally use a professional print company that offers documents to post. Printing the certificates yourself would just result in a unpro piece of paper which doesn’t look official or legit. Those certificate mockups I linked above look so sweet and the quality is amazing when printed on thick shiny paper.

I used this method two/three years ago for my mother and she literally framed the certificate and was so chuffed that she owned Bitcoin. To this day, she hasn’t cashed out and always checks the price, bless her.

Edit: Wow thanks for the silver mystery reddit user, never received any awards before so that was a super nice surprise! I will continue to find new ways in which to expand bitcoin into the mainstream. God bless Bitcoin and the community!",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Best Options for Student Loan Repayment,"Hello everyone!

I will try and keep this post short and sweet, but I am looking at the different options to deal with the student loan debt that I've accumulated while going to undergraduate and graduate school.

This June I will be graduating with my Doctor of Chiropractic degree and I will have close to \~240K in student loan debt. Thankfully, all of my student loans are federally based with no private loans taken out. I do truly believe that I can payback all my debt over a matter of time, but I need to know what options I have when it comes to repayment.

Standard repayment vs income-based? From my understanding, income-based has a smaller monthly payment, but the debt will ultimately accumulate faster because of interest. I have also seen articles about loan forgiveness - is that an option?

Like I said earlier, I want to fully repay back all of my loans, but at the same time, I don't want to be a slave to my debts right out of the gate.

Disclaimer: I currently have a family of 4 that I will be supporting coming out of school and I already have plans as working as an associate for 3 years. After that time, I will be completely buying out an already established practice to acquire full ownership in my local area.",finance
personalfinance,I'ma 24 year old part time student/part time worker. I'm going to be taking classes over the summer and am unsure of my options financially for the next year.,"I'm a 24 year old in college. I went to college the first time when I was 18 but had to take time off due to medical problems. I couldn't get enough money to go back for a few years so I worked when I could. 

 I went back to a different (cheaper) school this past fall. I paid for fall tuition outright and did a payment plan for the spring. This year is completely covered. I have to take summer classes to graduate but there is no payment plan option available. I will be working full time over the summer so around second week in may to third week in august. I will make enough money to cover school in the summer but it will be after the due date and I need to save a decent portion of it for the next year when I will be a full time student and probably won't have time to work.

I also have to get work done on my car in a week and a half that will cost around $1,400. I have this money but that's about it. I won't have money for gas or groceries for about two weeks till I get paid. I will be working full time the week I get the work done on my car so I will make around $420 that week after taxes but won't see the money till the next paycheck a week or two later.

I applied for a credit card through my credit union and was denied. I'm waiting to get a letter in the mail letting me know why I was denied. I have been paying student loans from my first school so i have a very small amount of credit. I also had a paypal credit account opened in my account that wasn't from me so there is an open fraud case for that with paypal.

I'm wondering what my best option would be. 

1. Try to get a loan for the summer whether it be a federal loan or from a private lender. (Only problem is I don't have anyone to cosign)

2. Apply for a credit card through another bank. If I got the credit card in time I could put most of my car work on my debit card and a small amount (a few hundred) on the credit card and pay it off when I get my $420 paycheck. This way I would have some money for groceries and gas and still get the work done on my car. 

For the upcoming fall and spring, I already filed my fafsa. I'm able to get a federal grant and federal loans. I will be good with paying for next school year with the grants and loans but I won't be able to work to have money for gas or anything like that so I need to save all I can over the summer.


I'm not sure where to go from this point.",finance

personalfinance,Debit card dispute help.,"I used a debit card to make a purchase in NYC while on a weekend trip. My wife did not like the item I purchased, so I returned it to the merchant once they had sent me a prepaid FedEx shipping label. 

The company never refunded me, and then proceeded to go out of business so their customer service department was dissolved. 

Since my bank cannot reach the merchant, but has all the proof that I returned the item (receipts, tracking number, email interactions), they refuse to give me my money back. They initially provided a temporary credit, but since the merchant has not responded, they have told me I cannot get my money back. 

Here are my questions: 

Shouldn’t a chargeback be instituted and money be refunded to me? 

Do I have any protection/insurance in this situation? 

Overall I’m looking for a solution to get the money I rightfully deserve back into my account. Seems unfair that my bank will not honor my situation even after ample evidence has been provided.

personalfinance,"Planning on moving, pay more Taxes and keep savings liquid or IRA and pay less taxes.","I just ran my wife and I's tax information through turbo tax and in doing so realized that I messed up while filling out my W4 and didn't withhold enough through out the year.

Playing with turbo tax I was able to see that if we both contribute the max to a traditional IRA we can get what we owe down to just over 1000.

I've the last 8 months we've been pretty good about saving and have managed to accumulate about 18,000 in savings. This was to be our 6 month emergency fund and fund our move. 

As I see it, we have 2 options and then two methods to execute each option. 

1) Open a traditional IRA, contribute the $5500 max per person and save $1800 but make a bulk of our savings inaccessible. Pay the remaining $1000. Either out of savings or by establishing a payment plan with the IRS to spread the load over time. 

2)  Pay the $2800, keep all our capital liquid. Again this could either be done in one bulk payment or by setting up a payment plan. 

We do not currently have an IRA or 401k established. Both of us have anxiety about putting savings somewhere that we cannot access it if we need to.",finance

Bitcoin,Vitalik on Twitter: not sure if the main purpose of bitcoin is to check government monetary policy ??,"This is truly unbelievable. In fact, trying to decrease the power of government to arbitrarily inflate the currency is the MAIN REASON why bitcoin (and therefore blockchain) was developed. Vitalik says he is not sure it belongs among the 'top five' reasons. In fact, it is reason #1, #2, #3, #4, and #5 !!! Here is the tweet:

https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/991095496520318976

The reason I posted this here is because many people may not realize that Vitalik was once a true bitcoin OG. However, like many of those early bitcoiners he really DID NOT truly understand what bitcoin was all about. It's now painfully obvious that many of those guys missed the big picture of viewing bitcoin as a new type of money and instead viewed bitcoin as just another payment system.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Refinance or Get New Credit Card?,"I am in a situation where I’d like to refinance my auto loan AND get a new CC. For my auto loan, I have an interest rate of 8.05% through Capital One.  I have a secured CC with CapOne that I have been using to rebuild my credit. I have made 100% payments on time for a little over a year on both my CC and Auto Loan. The thing is, I feel like the utilization on my CC is hurting my score. To help my score I wanted to get a QuickSilver Card that CapOne has offered me. I figured a higher limit will help with the utilization on my current secure card. I also would like to refinance my auto loan to help increase my debit. My main worry is having two credit pulls basically at the same time hurting my credit score. Also, with my current score, approximately 680, I am not sure if/how that can affect my chances of refinancing. Also, I wanted to open a Roth IRA account and was hoping to do that and the auto refi through a credit union, and a higher limit (again, all for the sake of lower utilization) through CapOne. 

Does my plan make sense? Is there anything that I am not seeing here?",finance

investing,Fed overnight repo operation oversubscribed,"The New York Fed's overnight repo operation offering liquidity to broker-dealers was oversubscribed on Tuesday. The Fed tendered $100 billion of temporary funds in return for high-quality collateral like Treasurys and mortgage-backed bonds, with $108.6 billion of bids offered for the available funds. The longer-term 14-day repo operation of $20 billion was also oversubscribed by around 3.5 times. Tuesday's results are a reversal from the last few months which has seen take-up of the Fed's cash offerings steadily fall due to the Federal Reserve's monthly purchases of Treasury bills. The Fed's repo operations and asset purchases are designed to inject reserves into the banking system and allow dealers to lend funds to market participants that use short-term lending markets to finance their trading operations, ameliorating the funding pressures that surfaced in September and sent overnight borrowing rates to as high as 10%.

personalfinance,How will a Fed rate cut effect the price of mortgages?,Hello all! So I read that Trump is calling for a fed rate cut. Will this actually effect the interest rates on mortgages as well? I've heard mixed things. They are pretty low as we speak. Do they have a chance to go lower with a Fed cut?

personalfinance,Did my mortgage broker mislead me?,"So three years ago I was buying my house and the mortgage broker provided me with paperwork that said the interest rate was going to be 4.5%. This was a USDA loan with no down payment. Then later on, the appraisal (appraiser was hired by the mortgage company, as they also paid him) came back and I was going to be short about $3k.  Meaning the maximum loan I was approved for was also the appraisal value, but the price of the house was $3k more.

My state (DE) provides down payment assistance through various programs, so I was going to apply for them, but the broker told me it was a long process and I may not get anything, so I shouldn't bother applying.

I told my parents and they wrote me a check for $5k.  The broker said not to cash their check because I would have to provide my parents' bank statements to show where the money came from was not an illegitimate source. I did not feel comfortable asking my parents for all of their bank statements.

The mortgage broker suggested that the mortgage company would cover the difference, but in return they would have to raise the interest to 5.75%. He said this was my best option and that it would help move things along faster, so I agreed.

I am looking back at this and I think I may have been misled.  Was I lied to? Do I have any options now?",finance

investing,U.S. Corporate Supply Chain going forward &amp; 50 bps Cut,"The Federal Reserve just announced a 50 bps interest rate cut, the largest emergency cut since the financial crisis, in hopes of reducing the effects of the Coronavirus on the U.S. economy. Unfortunately, the G-7 were unable to move forward a similar effort to act overnight. Nevertheless, stimulus has been provided to U.S. corporations in the form of lower interest rates, and hopefully this will spur further investment or at least alleviate financing issues caused by any slow down.

I believe this is definitely a wake up call for U.S. companies and a lesson learned. The era of concentrated supply chain in China will not be so going forward and companies will take a long and hard look at diversifying their suppliers and supply chain so that something like this, whether it happens in China, or anywhere else around the world, won't be felt as hard the next time around. Don't get me wrong, I think China will still be the dominant powerhouse in the manufacturing sector, and much of products will still be produced there, but I am almost certain that when and if this blows over, there will be communication from upper management about how to mitigate the concentration risk going forward.

In my opinion, I think corporations will start to move a small portion of their Chinese investment outside of China: perhaps the likes of Vietnam, Malaysia, Taiwan, Africa, Mexico, Brazil, or India. In other words, Emerging Markets Ex-China. This is open for discussion.

I believe a way to gain exposure to this is through some sort of EM Ex-China ETF. The only one I've found is [EMXC](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/288504/ishares-msci-emerging-markets-ex-china-etf-fund) that's offered by iShares. I would be interested to know if there are any other vehicles out there that would give similar exposure.

**TLDR:**

* 50 bps Fed rate cut puts money in U.S. Corporations pockets.
* When, and if, the Coronavirus blows over, the message from upper management will be how to mitigate supply chain risk going forward. The likely answer would be to diversify suppliers/supply chain.
* China will still remain the manufacturing powerhouse going forward; but a small portion of Chinese investment will flow out to other Emerging Markets: such as Vietnam, Malaysia, Taiwan, Africa, Mexico, Brazil, or India. This will perhaps not be optimal, but a redundant measure in order to mitigate concentration risk.
* A way to gain exposure to this is through some sort of EM-Ex China ETF such as EMXC offered by iShares. Open for comment on other ways to gain exposure.",finance

I did 2 semesters from Fall 2011 - Spring 2012 and dropped out afterward. I was also an idiot and let my loans go to collections and just completed student loan rehab last year on 5/23/19. Today I got a letter in the mail saying I still have a balance with the college directly and am trying to validate all of the information and whether or not I need to pay this. I emailed them and was told that my ""Plus loan was never applied because the Master Prom Notes weren't signed"", what does that even mean and why are they only reaching out now after 9 years? I recall signing up for a Plus loan with my mother and she's not a very well organized person so it's certainly plausible that the loan was never taken out. Once I get in contact with her I'll check her accounts and credit report.

Email response:

&gt;The balance on your account is from unpaid tuition.  The Plus loans never applied because Master Prom Notes were not signed causing this balance.  The loans that you paid in full on 5-23-2019 were your federal Subsidized and Unsubsidized loans through the Department of Education.

personalfinance,Refinancing a mortgage - what’s the catch? Why would my own lender be pushing me to refinance?,"I bought my first home July 2018. Original loan was acquired by my current lender in Dec 2019. 

I keep getting emails and notifications from my lender (Mr Cooper / NationStar) to explore refinancing.

When googling the current mortgage interest rates, they are lower than my existing mortgage. In fact my current interest rate seems really high compared to what I can see just with a quick google search. So what’s the deal? 

Why would my lender WANT me to refinance to a lower interest rate? 

I will freely admit I am pretty naive about how this all works. Like I said, first home I’ve ever owned and I pretty much relied on my realtor and my parents to help me navigate the lending process. 

Potentially relevant info: 
- loan origination July 2018

- loan acquired by Mr Cooper Dec 2019 

- current interest rate: 5.25% (no points - although I have no idea what that even means)

- principal remaining: $283,180

- current equity estimate (according to my lender): $58,822

- Not sure if this is relevant, but..... We purchased the house for 305k, and I believe the value of the home has probably increased. It was originally appraised at 320k, and several identical floor plan homes in our neighborhood have recently sold in the 340s (I’d say very comparable - some with slightly “nicer’ interior touches but far worse yard - some with less desirable interior but decent yard, some with a pool and some without (we have a pool and an amazing yard). 

Anyway - I would very much appreciate any kind of basic explanation of how refinancing works and why - and what I’m missing. It can’t be as simple as “get a lower interest rate and pay less!” 

Thanks!",finance

I recently completed a new w4 for my employer with $4000 for dependents (I have one kid and one on the way). I also added an extra amount to be taken out per per check. My bi-weekly gross pay for my base salary is roughly $1923.  I was paid on Monday for the first time after submitting my new w4. No federa l income tax was taken out of my check, only the extra amount. I asked my employer if this was correct and they sent me the IRS calculator they use to calculate the amount of federal taxes should be deducted from my check and it says $0. I was sent a copy of the IRS calculator they use and I can input a salary up to $2367 before it starts taking out $1 in federal income tax. This is based on step 1. married joint” and step 3. $4,000.

On my last pay stub for 2019, my gross pay was $1923 and I was set up as married/joint and had only 1 dependent. My federal income tax taken out was $149.65. If I put the same info in for 2020, it’s a much lower amount withheld at $24. 

I know there have been some changes to taxes but I don’t remember hearing it would be this big of a change. Even going back to my last pay check in 2020 before I updated my w4 to add another dependent, the amount of Federal tax taken out was $128. 

I know this is a jumbled mess but can anyone explain to me what is going on? I receive a monthly bonus which is 2/3 of my income and I want to make sure enough is being taken out so I’m not paying a large amount of income tax next spring. Thanks!",finance

personalfinance,Are these closing costs reasonable?,"Hello everyone,

Like many others, I am currently looking to take advantage of the low interest rates available to refinance. I bought my home in 2016 with a 30 year loan at 3.875%. I had no idea what I was doing at the time, and was talked into an FHA loan with 3.5% down, even though I had saved enough to put 20% down on a conventional loan. So now I am stuck paying 91 dollars a month in PMI for the next 26+ years unless I refinance this loan. I would also like to move to a 15 year term for the lower interest rates available. 

I have applied with several different lenders and the lowest rate I have seen is 2.875% for a 15 year fixed, with no points. I have run the calculations and between eliminating PMI, and the reduction in interest over time, I would save just under 76000 dollars over the life of this loan. This all sounds great, and I definitely plan to proceed, however, I have never refinanced before, so I am note sure how the closing costs on this loan compare to what is available from other lenders. I was hoping people with more experience can look over some of these numbers and let me know if they are in line, or if I should keep shopping. 

ESTIMATED HOME VALUE - 185000

So, do these cost seem relatively normal for a refinance? I don't mind shopping around more if I have to, but if it would only save me a couple bucks it may not be worth starting over at this point.

Numbers are rounded to the nearest dollar.

The reason for my question is I listen to a finance podcast that has listeners call in and explain their financial situation. People that call in with a similar salary to mine are then told by the host that their take home pay should be around $7k per month. 

Granted there are things like living in a state without income tax, having kids, being married, but does it really impact net take home pay by $2k per month? I am not referencing a one-off situation, it's a consistent response on this podcast to this income range. Also, no details are ever given as to how that number is calculated.

In the near future, daycare centers (and schools) will begin to close to prevent the spread of disease. During that time, women will become highly unproductive to the economy [insert joke about women ever being productive here]. It isn't a matter of if, but when.

Additionally, consumer goods stock is dwindling in warehouses all across the country, as are supplies and materials for assembly and manufacturing. Just because something is ""made in the USA"" doesn't mean its components are. There is a significant lag time between when the shipping lanes stopped moving goods (and Chinese factories scaled back) to when the supply shock hits the US.

Today's bump in market prices was speculation over Fed rate hikes by the media to shake retail investor's puts out of the market. The media is owned by very rich people who leverage uncertainty by creating predictable market gyrations and profiting from them. That is what happened today and will continue to happen. Don't panic into the market during the next few weeks unless you want to lose money. Do not buy back into the market as a retail investor until after daycare centers have begun closing. Some time after that is when the bottom will be found.

People should remember that for the first half of Feb the stock market remained elevated, even though everyone had access to the information that plainly showed China was a total mess. The market does not act timely, and it doesn't always take all information into account, it is a herd of humans behaving more like a swarm, and it isn't as intelligent as many like to pretend.

personalfinance,"Looking for advice on how to resolve my financial mess... owing IRS, cars, and possibly job loss","Hey all,

I am not as bad off as some of the posts I read on here, but I still feel like my situation is in a pretty dire position and that if I don't figure things out soon, could be in a lot worse.

I am an older fella.. not retired, still working. Currently have a pretty decent job, but I am struggling in it and without going in to why I think so.. I suspect my days are numbered. If I can pull out two more months, I would be ecstatic, but the particular work I am working on right now, I have almost know idea how to solve in a timely fashion and time is everything in this job.

I have a home that has around 300K equity. Could be more or less, but right around there. Selling it is not a good option because they are building new homes up the street for not much more than what I would likely sell this for (based on the value of some homes around me that recently sold), but most of the time when new homes are going up near by it's tough to sell a 10 year old home, even though my location is actually pretty good (court yard, near schools, etc).

I did some 1099 work a couple years back and didn't pay quarterly taxes. I paid my state taxes for that year, but I still owe the IRS about 80K, not sure how much penalties/etc have surmounted but this was for 2018 taxes.. so its a year over due. I reached out a few months back, tried to get the plan where they cut what you owe in half or so.. turns out I dont qualify, so I haven't called back yet. Also, I am pretty sure I am going to owe about 25K or so for 2019 taxes.

When I add up our mortgage (3500 a month), cars (2 of them at 1350 a month total), food (we have a family, we go through about 3K a month between eating out and food we buy), insurance ($350 a month thanks to teenagers driving), phone ($350 a month for 5), gas/electricity (about $250 a month as we have solar) and a few other misc bills, basically we average a monthly outgoing of 9K to 10K. Which absolutely forking boggles my mind how it costs us this much to live!

As for credit cards, we had issues years ago and since getting some cards that earn points, we pay them off every month. Most of what we buy (food, etc) we put on the cards, then pay them off each month. So we typically have little revolving debt each month. Sometimes we let it slide, or.. like what just happened where my water heater died and it's costing me 3500 to get it taken care of... we'll charge that on the card then pay it off usually in a month or two.

In total, with IRS, the two cars, and one of my kids school loans, we owe about $175K.

So.. now.. this is what I am hoping some of you that have been down this path and/or are smart with finances might be able to help me figure out.

My thought was to somehow lower my monthly outgoing expenses. Oh, we also have PMI on the house right now (FHA loan). We originally wanted to refinance the house into a new loan that got rid of PMI. PMI is about $400 a month for us right now, and after we get the house evaluated, we should have enough value to get a new loan and remove PMI. House value is about 750K.. give or take 50K. We owe $375K. That is why I think we have around 300K to 350K equity.

I was thinking if we could redo our loan, and take some money at the same time, to pay off our other debt which runs us ($1350 for the cars, and the IRS bill after we put 20K down would be about $750 a month for 6 years for a 50K payment), the cost of the mortgage loan may go up a bit, but I would assume redoing the loan for 30 years (we owe 22 now) would keep the price around 4K or so a month. I don't know for sure.. I dont know how to figure out math, interest rate, etc at this point.

There is also the option of home equity line of credit.. but I am not sure how that works in terms of interest. Like, our two cars are both 4% interest. If the home equity line is MORE interest.. it would be stupid to pay those off and pay more interest on that loan, right? Also not sure if the term is longer to pay that back.

My other concern with all this is IF I lose my job (which currently pays around 10K a month after taxes) and I end up with a job that pays like 3K a month... which is likely.. we lose a LOT of income. I have been lucky the last few years to find good paying jobs, and made some stupid financial decisions not paying shit off sooner. As I have no retirement, only this house, I am a little worried about my situation as I am nearing that retirement age. If I borrow against house, pay off all debt, and between wife and I we have just enough to barely make it.. I mean.. it would suck but so be it.

Been trying to find a way to get down to about 6K a month to live on.. which is another reason I was trying to figure out if I pay off the cars, IRS and such and have one payment only to worry about, if that will be a good route to go or if I am truly making a bad decision doing that.

TL;DR Owe a lot of money between IRS, cars, etc. Have a good paying job now but likely losing it soon. Have home with equity of about 300K or so. How to wipe out debt, lower my monthly outgoing costs, get on track to wiping out all debt.",finance

personalfinance,Which loan type for best interest rate?,"Hello Reddit!  I have some questions regarding which loan type would provide me with the best interest rate. This is my first post, so If I need to tag this in motorcycle or subcategory etc please let me know how.

Credit is good 735+ and income is stable.  I have great credit history and no negative marks as I can see now on reports.  Mostly all Credit cards and 1 car loan payed off years ago.  Never missed any payments etc.

 I have already made my mind up on financing vs paying cash in order to diversify credit variety of credit account types, keep cash in hand, and plan to pay the loan off early to pay least amount of interest possible.

I am an experienced rider, this is not my first bike, I use it for half of my commuting, I carry full insurance, and I am aware that toys are not good items to finance in general.  For me this is a perfect item as the price is less than 10k, and will allow me to show a different type of credit (small loan) being borrowed and paid in full well ahead of time.

I purchased the motorcycle new last year and put it on a credit card with 12 months interest free period.  Have used the last year to make payments and build credit higher, but now the interest free period is over...so I need to transfer this purchase to some type of a loan so that I can pay it off in full and have this new paid account reported in the near future.

\*\*\*Should I be looking for a new motorcycle loan or motorcycle refinance loan even though I already have the bike's title in my name...or an unsecured personal loan from bank or credit union?

If the approvals of the loan themselves are not an issue - Does anyone know if a motorcycle or auto loan would give me a better rate than an unsecured personal loan?

Someone told me to finance it for the longest term amount possible with the lowest rate and to to pay it off as early as I can, but not sooner than 6 months.  Would the personal loan ""look better"" on a credit report as being paid in full ahead of time or would both affect it the same?

Any experiences or insights would be greatly appreciated.  Let me know if I forgot any important info and thank you all in advance for your help!!!",finance

personalfinance,Using Indiana 529 to Repay Student Loans - Is My Process Sound?,"Hello there, PF! I'm looking for someone to help me nail down the best plan for leveraging my Indiana 529 plan to repay my (and my wife's) student loans with some tax benefits now that the SECURE act has passed.

Relevant details:

* I (26M) and my wife (26F) have approximately $45k in Federal Student Loans (most with 3-5% interest rates)

* $15k are in my name, $30k in my wife's

* Our first child is due in August (yay!)

* We are Indiana residents, no plans to move.

* Currently both employed, but this will change once baby arrives. Wife may nanny some other kids, but will be a SAHM from Aug-Dec 2020.

We live comfortably, but will be stretched slightly once we go down to just my income. We will be able to continue making slightly more than the minimum payment, with any windfalls going to pay toward these loans. Emergency fund and baby funds are all in good shape.

**With all that in mind, this is my current plan:**

* Fund a 529 in my name, making regular loan payments on my student loans by ""passing the funds through"" the account. Cap this at $5000 for the year, to gain the $1000 *state* tax credit for 2020.

* Continue paying my wife's loans from our checking account to ensure we take advantage of the $2500 *federal* interest deduction.

* Repeat this process in 2021 to reach the $10k max for *me.*

* Transfer the 529 (or open another) to my Wife in 2022, again passing $5k through, then paying any additional from our checking to gain any available federal deduction.

* Repeat for 2023, hitting my Wife's $10k max.

* Transfer 529 to our child, begin saving for their college as we pay off the last few grand of our loans from the checking account to get the final federal deduction.

If this works, we would get **$1k per year in state credits** and **$2500 in Federal deductions** for the next 4 years, essentially saving us **$14k** on that balance of $45k - right?!

*I know that in the last couple years, we likely won't be able to claim the full $2500 federal deduction as the loans amortize, but there will be a partial benefit at the very least.*

**TL;DR** - Would like to save as much as possible in paying for student loans by passing funds through an Indiana 529 up to the state max for a tax credit, while paying additional loans from the checking account to grab student loan interest deduction from the feds. Not double dipping because they will be different dollars - right?",finance

I’ve found myself in a situation that I’m trying to make sense of regarding loans, and wanted to reach out and see if anyone out there can offer some advice. 

I recently had my truck stolen outside my house. Looks like it’s not going to be found, at least not anytime soon and definitely not in any sort of usable condition. Insurance is paying me $10,000. I have found another truck to buy, from a private seller, for $27,000. I have great credit, no issues getting a loan through my credit union. Here’s the catch: the truck is located in Canada. In order to purchase it I’ll need to take out a personal loan, as my credit union won’t finance a vehicle that is not registered in the US. 

SO my plan is as follows: Take my $10k insurance payout, take out an unsecured loan for $20k (to make sure I can cover taxes, customs fees, etc), purchase said truck, register said truck in the US (I live in Washington state). Then I’m planning to immediately cash out refinance for a lower interest rate and make my monthly payments. 

Is there anything glaringly wrong with this plan? I’d like to avoid the high interest rate of an unsecured loan, and my credit union will refinance for 100% of the Kelly Blue Book value. Since the US dollar is stronger than the Canadian dollar, this will work in my favor, unless I’m missing something. 

Any advice would be appreciated!! Please spare me any “Why don’t you just buy a truck in the US?” type posts. I’m close to the border and this truck is available and exactly what I want. Thank you all in advance for your help!!",finance

stocks,FED's big mistake,"Let me start by saying I highly respect and value the experts in the FED. I believe they have a lot of experience, knowledge and data, on which they base their decisions.
All of that being said, today’s decision to cut the rates was absolutely unnecessary, wrong and in the end will have only negative effects. As I stated in my forecasts today and yesterday, the FED cutting rates has nothing to do with resolving the Coronavirus. This is not a financial issue, it is a biological problem. I am in Europe right now and you do not have to be here to know people are emptying shelves in fear of food shortages, events are being canceled, sports games postponed etc. I hope this does not replicate in the States, but I am pointing it out to paint a picture that lowering rates will not get the sports match back on schedule, nor the people back into crowded malls, concerts etc. Most of Europe and Japan have already negative rates and they have had those for years now with no positive impact on their economies. This move from the FED now pressures ECB officials to cut rates next week (it is expected by 10bp), as well as other Central Banks around the world. This is a race to the bottom with no meaningful solution to the problem, a virus outbreak.
I believe the only reason they did this move is to calm the stock market and what happened – the exact opposite. After an initial spike of more than 600 points, the move reversed and all the major indexes finished in the red with the Dow losing almost 800 points finishing at 25917. The stock market’s reaction can be attributed to two factors:

The market was already expecting a rate cut at the next FED meeting, but since it got it so early now it is expecting one or two additional ones.

The FED cutting rates proved to the sceptics that there will be significant economic impact and that is why there was a massive sell off after the initial spike.

So instead of reassuring the markets of a proactive Monetary policy, the FED only induced more panic, it used up 50bp at once and now there is only 1% left from turning negative. Also with all the QE it has done over the years, the tools left in their arsenal to fight is smaller and smaller.
In my forecast today I wrote it will be a down day and it is one of the few days when I am sad to be right. I was expecting the Dow to finish slightly lower as a normal pull back after the massive gains yesterday. But now with this move, not only are we deeper in the red than expected, there are absolutely no good news that we can expect in the upcoming days. There are more and more deaths in Washington State, the virus is spreading in more and more places, if Europe is any indication concerts and sports events will start to cancel and the general panic will just grow.
Sadly I am writing this hopping I will be proven wrong, but if I am right there is still a long ways down for the market lead by unpredictable algorithmic trading where fundamentals and value are thrown out of the window.",finance

If I pay $10,000 now and wipe it out, I'll save a few hundred in interest and hopefully have the largest affect on my credit score.

personalfinance,Mortgage Insurance/Refinancing,"I’d like to get some advice on refinancing our home but I don’t know where to start?

We bought our home in 2015 before the housing market skyrocketed, our interest rate is pretty low, and our loan was for 215k. Zillow is saying it’s worth 315k today, without adding the improvements we’ve done to it.

We’ve done quite a bit of improvements to our house since we moved in. Installed a 10x25 foot deck, full garden/relaxation area with 4 very large raised beds and a stone patio with a fire pit and bench seating. Also I installed ductless heating/cooling units and a full surround sound stereo system with a bathroom speaker.

The only downside to all of this is we had to take mortgage insurance because we didn’t have enough to pay a down payment to get us out of needing mortgage insurance. 

I’d like to know whether it makes sense to refinance our home, or not, and what benefits/downsides may come from it.

personalfinance,Should I refinance my 30 year mortgage? Condo in Chicago Loop,"Original mortgage terms: Conventional 30 year mortgage, 4.25% interest rate. Bought the condo in May of 2017.

Current monthly payment is $598/month ($187 principal + $411 interest).

Current balance of Loan: $116k.

Value of home: bought at $152k in May of '17, likely appreciated with surrounding area (Chicago Loop). I am guessing it is worth $170k or $180k.

Current credit score: 723

Main goal: lower monthly payments.

&amp;#x200B;

Chase offer (I called them):

3.625% 30 year mortgage

$2,800 in closing costs including appraisal

New payment would be $553/month.

Payback is 62 months ($2,800 closing costs/$45 saved per month).

&amp;#x200B;

""Lower"" offer (they called me)

3.25% 30 year mortgage

$4,100 closing costs including appraisal (not sure if this includes points?)

New payment is $529/month

Payback is 59 months ($4,100 closing costs/$69 saved per month).

Should I shop for more offers? Is this a good deal? Is this process worth it?

What is an acceptable payback period?

personalfinance,Looking for some advice on my credit card debt situation.,"Hello /r/personalfinance!

I'm looking to get some advice on what I should do with my credit card debt. Currently I have 3 cards (all with capital one) with the following balances and interest rates:

* Card 1: $2,445.14 @ 18.40%
* Card 2: $11,925.42 @ 17.40%
* Card 3: $9,993.02 @ 16.40%

I'm working full time and I also do freelance work. I'm able to make the minimum payment, plus a little more each month. Usually around $30 more for each card. I am currently working on a freelance project that pays monthly that will be able to pay off about $15,000 of this debt. I have been going back and forth between a few options.

1. Leave my balances at capital one and just pay the mins + extra when I can and put all the money from the freelance project towards the debt.
2. Find a balance transfer card with a 0% apr and transfer the balances over to that. Looking at a 21 month 0% APR just to have some breathing room. Once I move the balances, I would lock or even close the capital one cards. Probably lock to keep the line of credit open and just not carry the card with me as well. This would mean taking on an additional ~$1200 from the balance transfer fees. 
3. Take out a loan and do the same with with locking/closing the cards.

Right now I'm leaning towards 2, because even thought i'll take on an additional ~$1200, that would be less than the amount I would take on with my current interest rates. Also, I know I'll be getting the money from the freelance work I'm doing right now over the next few months and will keep making my normal payments. I'll also still be making my normal payments.

personalfinance,"How would my money be better spent - by securing a slightly better interest rate to start, or by saving cash to refinance into a mortgage with incredible rates 6 months from now?","Hi everybody! My partner and I are shopping mortgage rates for our first home. We have the money to put 10% down but I’m wondering if I’d be better off minimizing my cash to close to apply our funds to a VA loan refi after our wedding in 6-12 months (this probably sounds scary but we’ve been together 10 years).

We’ve been pre-approved for a few:

A 30yr. 0% down, no PMI, 5% interest loan

A 30yr. 3% down, PMI req., 4% interest loan

A 3/5ARM 10% down, no PMI, 4% interest loan

A 5/1ARM 5% down, PMI req., 3.25% interest loan


So what I’m wondering is should I put more cash down now to get a better rate off the bat, and wait a few years to refinance (or maybe just don’t refi at all) - or should I save my cash to go towards refinancing into a cash-out VA loan refi 6 months to a year from now once we’re eligible to get an unbeatable rate (it’s 2.875% today)? I figure I’d eat several thousand in closing costs by doing that, but I’d break even quickly with such a deep rate cut, and my VA loan closing costs wouldn’t be quite as bad (I think about 2-3%). 

Plus if I save my money from the first closing, I could use it as a down payment to reduce my LTV when I refi or put some of it towards discount points, etc. It’s a 300k mortgage and we plan to be in the area for at least 3-7 years.",finance

We've come into a small windfall of $3,000. We could use this to partially repay my mother-in-law, who lent us $5,000 to fully repay my wife's student loan balance, ostensibly to save on interest.

I like option 1: Bite off a big chunk of the smaller debt, see daylight in paying it off fully, then focus on the bigger debt. Logical, easy.

personalfinance,Is it a good idea to Cash-out Refi one of my houses to buy another house.,"Kinda of a tricky situation. I'm moving to a new town and want to get a house there. My current location I managed to get a bit lucky and currently own 2 homes. One is a rental and the other is obviously my main resident. I want to currently sell my Main Resident, which nets maybe around 90-100k in equity, and use that to buy a new place. My wife REALLY REALLY wants to keep our MR and rent it. 

So we've been thinking about doing a cash-out refi on our rental, to use as a down payment in new city. I think it's a bad idea to risk our VERY safe rental investment and acquiring new debt to just buy more debt. I can see some merit in doing it but also just feels wrong. 

House breakdown:

Rental - mortgage is 1200 (rents for 1650-1750) and interest rate is 3.25 (can't realistically go lower). Probably around 150k+ in equity.

MR - Mortgage is 2100 (would rent for maybe 2400), Has at most 100k in equity. It's also an older victorian that could be a rental that just cost us money as landlords due to it's age. There is also a possibility to refi this house (non-cashout) to lower the Mortgage to around 1800.

personalfinance,Should I refinance?,"Like a lot of people right now, I've been looking into refinancing.  I bought my house in July 2017 and have been paying a mortgage on it since.  The original loan was a conventional for $512,050 at 4.375%.  My mortgage payment right now is $2929 with $373 of that in escrow payment. Looking at better.com I received a couple of offers.


2.75%  $11085   $1998 a month

3.00%  $5700   $2064 a month

3.375%  -$1083   $2164 a month

3.50%  -$3271   $2198 a month


I think i know what all of this information means.  Would it make sense to try to go for the lowest interest rate as possible and pay 11K?  I think we are planning on staying int he house for at least 3-4 years. I would hope to try to do this without any out of pocket money but I know there are closing costs.  Do they typically wrap these into the mortgage and if so, how does this affect the monthly payment?

I don't know much about mortgages but it seems that it would be a good idea to refinance at this time.  Thank you for reading!

Edit:  Also, these quotes are for going back to a 30 year.  Are there benefits to trying to get it to stay on the same terms?  I.e. 27 years?  Will banks do that?",finance

Got my first full time job right out of college and on the second day I was told to fill out tax documents. Checked off exempt from federal taxes so federal taxes were withheld from my paychecks. 

So it’s tax season and I decide to file through TurboTax like I did last year (worked part time in college). TurboTax is saying I owe around $4500 in federal taxes which I thought was a bit high (I swallowed my mistake and will pay what I owe). I made about 51k last year. I asked my friends who make the same ball park I make and/or more than what I make and they’re saying they only paid around $2500-$3000 in federal taxes. Why do I owe so much? Can anyone help me out with this situation? My options are to go to like H&amp;R Block and get my taxes done professionally or just pay the $4500 I owe (which seems high to me). If I go get my taxes done professionally, would how much I owe be lower or does the $4500 seem right? NY State taxes were taken from my paychecks so I’m good with state taxes.

personalfinance,Help! I'm straddled with my parents' debt and I can't get up.,"Hello Financial Wizards of Reddit,


I've posted something similar awhile back, but I wanted to post again with more details to get some good advice.


When I started out college, my father had a relatively high paying job (around 100K/year).  Due to his high income, we were issued loans from the government.  I took out 15,000 dollars (which I just paid off!).  My parents took out $45,000.


Fast forward a couple of years: my dad loses his high paying job and is now making considerably less.  My mom has a chronic illness which prevents her from being able to work.  And so, they've asked me to take on payments for their loan.


Here are the details:

The loan is broken into two groups -

Group A: Principal of $23,918 with an interest rate of 6.410%

Group B: Principal of $17,817 with an interest rate of 7.210%


Now that I've paid off my own loan, I've been aggressively paying off Group A, as it's been accruing far more interest.  But is this the best method of attack?  Or should I consider refinancing my parent's loan with another company?


Any advice/guidance is much appreciated. Thanks for your time!",finance

personalfinance,Make credit cards jealous of each other!,"Hi all, 
if you have multiple credit cards giving you interest rates in the 20’s you should try this tip that worked for me. Please note that this is only viable if you have long term debt that you can’t pay off as soon as you can.

Step 1: Pay off your lowest balance, regardless of the interest rate. 
Step 2: Stop charging things to that card
Step 3: Each credit card has a section on their portal for “balance transfers”. Check this area periodically.
Step 4: Sooner or later you should see an offer for a balance transfer, typically these are 12-18 months of 0 or very low interest rates and charge an upfront fee of 3% or so.
Step 5: Use these funds to pay off another card completely, and then repeat the balance transfer step.

Background: I had multiple cards with about 30k of debt spread around. I have never missed a payment and other than credit usage % my credit was great. I noticed that after I paid off 1 card completely that was charging me about $100 a month of interest for dozens of months, I immediately got a balance transfer offer once the statement closed. My guess is their algorithms knew I was a nice meal ticket for them, obviously had more debt, and wanted to buy out the competition.

In a perfect world, you would want to pay off the highest interest card first, but sometimes it’s easier said than done. IMO it is better to pay off a card that has say $2000 at 18% vs a card that has $4000 at 22% and then hoping the first card gives you a balance transfer. 

Anyways that just my thoughts, good luck!",finance
personalfinance,Question about purchasing a second property,"My wife and I are looking at refinancing our current home with the intention of eventually renting it out.

We have heard from 2 lenders that there isn't really much of an issue for doing so (as long as the refinance was complete before we go under contract for a second place), however a 3rd lender had advised us to wait at least a year after refinancing to avoid being accused of mortgage fraud.

personalfinance,Coming into a little bit of money --- not sure which CC to pay off,"I'm coming in to a little bit of money. Like. Not enough to get excited about, but enough to cut down on some debt.

With the money, after paying house taxes and things that I need to pay, I will have enough to pay either nearly half of the $10,000 one or almost all of the $5,000 one. The thought being if I pay off the $5,000 one I will be able to focus all my other money on the $10,000 one and bring it down quickly. 

Currently I'm paying over the minimum on both but not making as much progress as I'd like because of interest and also not having a lot of spare money because of other bills. I rarely use either of them anymore. Built up the debt when I was having a rough time financially, but doing better now.

I ran the numbers with SoFi on a hypothetical lumped-together loan (even though I know I can't take on my wife's loans in my name), and I should be able to afford the combined monthly payments on a 5-year repayment plan and still keep our family's DTI ratio around 25%.

My question is whether or not I can even do both simultaneously (refinance my current loan, and co-sign for consolidating my wife's loans, both most likely with the same lender, SoFi for now)? Will the loan officers ""see"" both applications and potentially just choose one over the other? Am I better off just overpaying on my current loan (no penalties) and co-signing my wife's consolidation?",finance

personalfinance,"Buy/Sell a house via ""Land Contract"" - WI","Hello,

A family member who knows I'm into personal finance contacted me to ask a question about selling their home. They've been approached by the pastor of their church. The church would like to purchase the house to use for traveling visitors to stay in, or for seasonal workers to have a place to stay.

This family member heard about ""Land Contracts"" from another church friend (who is not associated or have any personal interest in the sale). This friend told my family member that she can get much better interest rates with a land contract (upwards of 6-8%). 

My family member contacted the church about this and they agreed to purchase the house via land contract.

From the research I've done it appears that land contracts are mainly used for people who have bad credit, and wouldn't qualify for a traditional loan. This is not the case with the church. So I don't see much of any downside or risk for my family member. I have no idea why the church would be willing to pay a higher interest rate than they can get with a 30 year locked mortgage rate, but apparently they're willing to do it.

What should I tell my family member?

**EDIT:** I should also add that obviously my family member would not be receiving a large lump sum like they would via a traditional sale. They're aware of this and are fine with it.",finance

personalfinance,"Should I pay off all my debt like my mortgage or invest my money? If so, where to invest for early retirement?","(on mobile please excuse the formatting) 

Hello PF,

I have been a lurker for a while in this sub, and I have been following the flowchart that is in this sub of how to attack bills and debt and then investing for retirement.

I am 26 years old, and I just paid off the last of my student loans so I am looking into what I should do next. I would like to semi-retire early from corporate work and work part time doing something I enjoy, so I don't think I want to put all my money into a 401K unless I am missing something about those.. But if I want to retire early I need a way to access my money before 64.5 if something comes up? I also reallllyyy hate debt, so I am tempted to start working on just laying off my mortgage? 

That being said, here is all the relevant information I could think of to help inform any advice:

Age: 26

Living situation: own my home, mortgage is $950 a month, I just bought it last July for $130k, 3.75% interest rate; girlfriend lives with me, pays $300 a month in ""rent"" and we split utilities

Dependents: 5 year old son (not my GFs); my GF and I don't want any kids in the future

Income: Base salary of $70,000 with $10k-$15k in quarterly bonuses; total annual income $110k-$130k

401K: I have about $15K in my 401k. I contribute 5% and my company matches 4%

Health insurance: I have a high deductible plan with an HSA. I contribute $200 a month to the HSA, my employer contributes $200 a quarter; I have about $5k in the HSA, all contributions beyond $2k are invested in mutual funds and get auto allocated there as long as the balance is $2k for the savings account portion 

Savings: I have been keeping $10k in my savings as an emergency fund, but I really wanted to knock out the last of my student loans so I dipped into that (not the most responsible I know, but I really hate debt lol). I have $1,000 there right now but will build it back up to the $10k

Monthly Expenses: 
Mortgage (mentioned above): $650 after my GF covers her portion
Car payment: $375 (2.49% interest rate, 3 years left) 
Car insurance: $150 (I live in a more urban area so rates are a bit higher than I would like) 
Cell phone: $60
Life insurance for my son and I: $75
Groceries: $350 a month
Internet, gas, electric, water, and sewer: roughly $125 a month for my half
Miscellaneous expenses, clothes for kiddo, play places, skiing, etc: $150-$200 

Roughly $2,100 for monthly expenses

What would you guys do if you were in my shoes and potentially wanted to retire early? 

Thanks so much in advance! 

Best

personalfinance,Car loan with ridiculous price hike. Am I an idiot?,"Am I an idiot or did they completely mislead me and is there anything I can do? Price for my truck was 47k with rebates and crap. That’s actually a great price for a brand new dually. 54k after taxes and fees, expected. They tell me monthly payments will be around $900 with 7.5% interest. Fine, whatever. I head into finance, am told payments will be almost $1,100 because it’s my second truck on my credit report so my interest rate is kinda high. (they offered me 1/3 of what my trades private sale value is so I told them I’d sell it myself). My plan is to refinance my new truck once my old one sells and I can put a few more grand down and have a better interest rate with the old one gone so the payment didn’t worry me. I sign everything, being lead to believe it was the $54,xxx just with a higher interest rate and shorter loan term so my payment is a little higher. Again, I’ll fix this issue once I sell my old truck. I proceed to log into chase and see they’ve added my new loan to my account with a principal balance of $66,000. What the FUCK? Am I missing something here? How did we go from 54 to 66 with a stated loan cost of $12k or so? Principal balance displays payoff, not loan balance. So my payoff now includes the interest I expected to pay over the life of the loan? What the hell is going on and am I just fucked into this deal?!",finance

personalfinance,"$50k in dept and I need some advice but wait, there's more.","So I acquired roughly $50k of credit card debt.  I'm a struggling wedding photographer in Ontario, Canada  Married for 5 years, with a new born.  

In the past 2 years, my business took a dive.  Bookings have become very minimal in the past few months.  2 years prior I would book 25-30 weddings a year, charging an average of $3000-$3500 for wedding photography.  It was running consistantly like this for thr past 3-4 years.  Business was great, clients have been booking, but all good things must come to an end in this case.  This year for 2020, I booked 6 weddings only.  Yes, the business changed alot and many photographers and videographers in the industry agree.  Anyone now a days can pick up a good camera and charge a client $500 to shoot a wedding.  But that's besides the point.  I'm 50k in dept and I need help, but i do have something coming my way.

So with all the CC dept, we had to move in with my parents. Not my greatest achievement but I am grateful to have amazing parents.  

I obviously want to get rid of this dept asap, but will take forever and ofcourse the interest rates are killing me.  Whatever I make goes towards my son and paying the minimum balances and to our daily expenses. My wife is on mat leave so she gets 55% of her cheque.  Finanancially my wife is good. She has money saved which is good. I dont want to touch her savings.  I rather have her keep it until shit hits the fan big.  She and I split the bills and expenses accordingly but I'm in the deep end about to go under.  

Soooo here's the thing.  I will be inheriting a bran new condominium that will be completed early next year of 2021.  The value of this condo is roughly $650k.  It will be paid off and my wife and I will be on title.  I'm sure the value will already have gone up when the condo is completed. So I was thinking of borrowing a loan from my parents by pulling the equity from their home to help pay my dept and in turn I will pay them back by pulling the equity from my future condo and refinance it to pay the mortgage left owing of what I borrowed.  My question is how soon can I pull the equity out from the condo once we move in and is it possible to do so I can pay my folks back.  

The person funding the condo is a good friend of mine and sees me like a son.  I've done lots of work with him by capturing his relative events and etc.  And over the years, we became good family friends.  So anyway, that being said.  He has some land and is building 2 properties and will be selling them soon to help pay off his and my condo.  He placed me in his will along with a couple of other individuals, so instead of inheriting the funds at a later date when he kicks the bucket, he is providing me the condo as an early inheritance.  The thing is I dont want to ask him for the 50k to pay my dept.  I know he will criticize my actions and tell me things I already know.  Over the years, he has looked to me with great respect and hold me in high regard when it comes to being responsible.  So I'm afraid if I ask a piece of the cheque to pay off the condo it look bad on my end.  Make sense?

I am open to hearing other alternatives as what I should do.  I know I will have to find other sources of income in the mean time but I want to know how I should go about doing this.",finance

personalfinance,Should I let my mother use my name to refinance her house?,"Hi All, 

This is a throwaway account since I know people who use reddit. My mother and aunt recently made an offer on a commercial property containing 3 houses previously used as a healthcare facility/group home for disabled teenagers and we found out a few days ago that their offer of 1.6 million was accepted. Their goal is to renovate it and rent it out as student housing. From what I know so far, my aunt has no intention of contributing anything to the property at the moment besides using her name and credit for the loan, and my mother is trying to fork up some money for the down payment and the renovations. I just recently got a job offer for a full-time position where I will be paid around 47,000 to 50,000 annually. When I told my mother this, she told me that she wanted to place the house in my name, and refinance it in order to afford her housing project. This property is in a really good location and from what I understand, has the ability to turn a really good profit if managed well. 

I have a few concerns with this. First, we live in Salt Lake City, Utah, and the house she wants to refinance is worth approximately 450,000. I highly doubt that the bank will allow us to refinance a house of this value based on my salary.

Second, a friend told me that this is considered fraud, as the house will technically not belong to me, despite being under my name. I am just a tool to help my mother finance her project as she lives abroad and does not earn any income. She is just dating someone who gives her money, however, she does not want to involve her boyfriend in this project, which is why she trying to drag me into this. In addition, I don't know how having a house in my name will affect my taxes. I was told by that same friend that that I could also risk commiting tax fraud if I list the - potential - mortgage interest rates as a tax write-off. My mom is telling me that she will pay the morgage for this house so that I won't have to make the payment using my own money. But I don't know if I believe her. It really depends on how soon we can start renting out rooms. 

Third, for personal and financial reasons, I don't think I should be involved in this project. I have $15,000 of student debt, $10,000 for my autoloan, and around $3000 worth of credit card debt to pay off. I would really like to get into real estate on my own in the future and I was told that having this house refinanced in my name could affect my goals. 

I guess I want to ask you guys what your thoughts were on using my name to refinance as a strategy for this housing project. Is what my friend told me true? Or is the risk of being caught for this kind of fraud very minimal. I'm very new to the world of commercial real estate and have no idea how this would impact my finances in the future. If it is a good idea, what is the best way to go about this? If not, what are some reasons I can use to convince my mom to let me stay out of it? Is there some other finance concern I'm taking into account?

We are on a bit of a hurry since we need to make the down payment soon and my moms broker is giving me a call tomorrow. I have a gut feeling this is a bad idea and I am 67% sure I don't want to be involved in this.",finance

personalfinance,"Left Ed Jones to start managing on my own, looking for confirmation","Hey all, I have been a long time reader of this sub-reddit and finally decided to take the plunge and begin managing my own money a few weeks ago.  I am a 31M married to a 31F and roughly 3 years ago decided to use Edward Jones to manage my money. After a lot of time spent not understanding what fees I was paying and not actually understanding how and why we were making different financial decisions, the final thing that convinced me to leave EdJones was the recommendation to begin putting my money into a LIRP since we made to much to have invest in a Roth.  Anyways, I decided to move all my assets to Fidelity and was just hoping for some confirmation that I am doing things right. It just so happens that I started doing this right around this big crash, so its been a bit of a whirlwind.  

Details about me:

Location: MI, USA  
Income -  
My Income: 130k (31M)   
Wife Income: 75k (31F)  
Debt -   
Student Loan: approx 120k @ 3.25% interest rate (paying 1700 a month)  
Mortgage: 350k @ 3.9%. (paying 2000 a month w/ insurance and taxes)  
Car Loan: 25k @ 2.99% (Paying 464 a month)

  
Savings:  
10k in checking (0.45%)  
15k in savings (1.6%)  
80k in Fidelity Brokerage account

Retirement:  
90k in Fidelity Rollover IRA (from previous job 401Ks)  
1k in my new job 401k  
40k in wifes 401k  
6k my Fidelity Roth IRA   
7k in wifes Fidelity Roth IRA  


We both put 10% of our salary to our 401k. I have invested all of our Fidelity accounts in the following percentages:  
30%  FSKAX  
35%  FZROX  
10%  FTIHX  
15%  FZILX  
10%  FXNAX  
The current thought process is that we should keep 15k in our savings for emergencies, and keep the checking around 10k for bills and such, and as we begin to build a surplus in the checking to move that into the fidelity brokerage account.

Sorry, this is a long post, I just wanted to make sure I didn't miss anything.  I am mainly looking for someone to tell me a few things:  
1. Did I make a good move avoiding the LIRP?  
2. How do my fidelity investments look? I used some recommendations I found throughout articles and posts on this subreddit.  
3. How am I doing in terms of retirement funds?  
4. Is there anything else I should be doing instead?

personalfinance,Take out home equity loan to pay off debt?,"Hi Reddit! 

Due to the coronavirus uproar, as I’m sure you’ve seen, the government has reduced interest rates in refinancing mortgages and what not to entice consumer spending.

Background: Married, combined income of $104k. Total debt (only student loans) is $77k.

My question is this - should my wife and I take out a home equity loan out, pay off the mortgage and then use whatever is left in equity to pay off a good chunk of the student loans? My guess would be that it also saves us money in interest from the student loans as the HELOC rate is 4.25 at the moment, and I have some loans upward of 6.6%.

I would estimate our house is worth around $140-$145k and we owe about $103k on it. Thanks in advance! If you need more info let me know and I’ll add it :)",finance

personalfinance,W-4 - Take out nothing but what I enter on Step 4C,"Greetings, 

A few years back I had HR make a change to include 99 exemptions (nothing withheld) and then a flat amount on top of that. This was done to limit the refund at the end of the year based upon my prior few years of tax liability. I don't want to give the IRS my money for use for free, and then get a large refund at the end of the year. I'd rather just have more in my paycheck during the year and get as close to zero as I can. 

So the 2020 W-4 comes out and I have no idea how to make this happen again. I'd like to adjust that amount based on my current refund for next year, given the new standard deduction. Anyways, I contact my HR department and they say ""the best that we can figure with the new W-4 is this:""

Step 1 – Married  
Step 2 – Not Checked  
Step 3 - $10000.00 on line 3  
Step 4C – enter the about of flat tax for federal withholding that you would like withheld.

I was asked to let them know if I made this change so they could watch my check to make sure it calculates this way. I'd like some input from others if possible on if this is correct, or if there's another way to fill out the 2020 W-4 so they only take out what I enter in Step 4C. 

Thank you!",finance
personalfinance,What to do with my cash in the light of a recession (Europe)?,"From saving for buying a house (which will not happen soon) and a bigger bonus I have a good 500k € in my checking accounts. I have another 60k€ as emergency fund in a saving account. I have no other assets apart from a paid new German car, no debt. I am 42, wife and kids, we’re lucky that our annual income has risen to around 300k€ net or more in the last years.l, we’re renting in an expensive area (and don’t want to move), and I can expect substantially more to come in over the next years. 

What shall I do with my cash right now - I don’t feel investing in stocks is wise today? It seems like the timing sounds more like waiting for the crash and invest then. Real estate where I live (Germany) is extremely overpriced - due to the low interest rates of the last years all possible investing objects are heavily overvalued (decent condos cost around 25-30 years of rent), which is huge. But leaving your assets in cash in a crisis also doesn’t seem to be a sound investment.

personalfinance,I've completely screwed myself and my son is going to suffer for it.,"Okay, this will be a long one. I have been a lurker for years but finally made an account because I have completely made a mess of my life and I really need some help.

I don't even know where to begin but let's start by saying I just lost my job due to some medical issues (yay America) and I have $150 in my bank account. Rent is already past due, my car insurance got cancelled yesterday, and pretty much all of my other bills are due. My son just lost his Medicaid because of a clerical issue so I spent yesterday at DFCS reapplying because he is already late on his 12 month vaccinations because he has been sick too. He needs meds and I can't help him, and it's completely breaking me up inside. 

His dad just got a new job (I was the breadwinner, as he has had physical problems and his entire career has been in a very laborious industry) because his last job was being garnished for child support arrears (his ex put him on years ago and never told him.. he was paying her out of pocket the whole time not knowing she did that). He just found out a few months ago when they arrested him for the warrant he didn't know about, suspended his license and took EVERYTHING.  No paychecks for months, and he has another kid that needs his help too.. we have no problem paying child support of course but good Lord we need to eat too. 

So now we can't afford childcare and I am going through too much pain to go back to working in restaurants.. the hours he works make it impossible to get an office job like I want. I need a procedure done next month but it was setup on the insurance through my job and I have no idea how that's gonna work now. We were counting on my taxes to pay rent and our bills this month, but I think I messed that up by claiming my son's father as a dependent. I thought I could since he was out of work most of last year. Now they are holding my refund and the message says they are reducing it because of child support or some other federal debt.. of which I have none. I didn't think they could take my taxes because of his child support but that's the only thing I can think of. 

I want to take this time to go back to school but I can't afford to pay out of pocket and I messed myself up yet again by ignoring my student loans from years ago. I was going to defer them and never did, and now they are in default. My credit is terrible, we have title pawns out on both our vehicles that we now can't afford to make payments on, and I still owe my mom for a loan that she took out for me. 

I feel absolutely helpless. I was just about to start the credit repair process when I lost my job and now I have no idea where to even begin. I feel like a complete failure and like I'm worth more dead than alive at this point. Every time I turn around it is something else and I am so tired. I am not sleeping and losing weight because I am so stressed out. I can't even feed my son properly. Someone please tell me there is something I can do because I am at the end of my rope.",finance
personalfinance,Worth it to refinance private student loans?,"Hi Reddit,

I am beginning to payback student loans and am looking to employ the snowball method.  However, while I found that I could reduce my loan repayment by $100 through refinancing with SOFI.  Would this help me to pay these loans off faster? These are the first on my list as they are private student loans and once paid I will be pushing all of this money into my big federal loans to accelerate payback there.

A little info:

I have 3 loans in a 10 year repayment via Sallie Mae: 1) $10,325 @ 10.25% &gt; $148.19/month, 2) $9,057 @ 10.5% &gt; $131.24/month, 3) $7,993 @ 10.25% &gt; $114.72/month.  In total, the combined charges are $394/month.

 I know this is very high, but at the time I had no other options for financing.   The rest of my federal loans average between 3.8-5.4%

The benefits of refinancing with SOFI are through reductions of the interest to 4.64-4.96% depending on the repayment term. Repayment terms for SOFI are as follows: 7 years @ 4.64% &gt; $387.25/month.  10 years @ 4.93% &gt; $294.15/month.  15 years @ 4.957% &gt; $220.45/month.

What I am struggling with is understanding if refinancing for the lower rate will reduce the amount I pay as in the current situation I anticipate paying the smallest SM loan off within 4-5 months, and so on for the next year and a half until all 3 are repaid.  I understand by refinancing it will consolidate them into one payment and will take away the quick wins, but won't it still be beneficial if I make the same payment towards the larger principal with a much lower interest?

Anyone in/or has been in a similar situation and has seen the light? 

&amp;#x200B;

TL/DR: Financially inept, trying to snowball but curious if refinancing some loans will help.",finance

- She thinks Greenspan was completely taken in by the fame and glory of being Fed Chair, he became obsessed with stock market performance throughout his time and it trickled down to subsequent chairs.

- She thinks that the banks are taking the Fed for a ride and are the ones pushing for lower rates when they could actually afford higher ones.

- That the Fed uses an outdated and inefficient inflation index because if they changed to something better ""our models would break"". And this is how they decide monetary policy! Craziness.",finance

personalfinance,Feedback on options when debt is low interest and stable?,"I am in a position to get what will be a pretty significant payout for me soon and I'm torn on how to move forward with it. It's not completely finished yet but should be in the neighborhood of $30k (maybe more). My car and mortgage are my only debts. I won't have to pay taxes on this money.

Car loan: Current balance: $18,633.28 Interest rate: 0.9% Current value of car is around $19k. No plans to get rid of it anytime soon (it's less than a year old).

Mortgage: Current balance: $45,509 Interest rate: 4.75% Current value of home (based on recent sales in my neighborhood) is around $85k. I am hoping to sell in the next 1.5-2 years but that's not locked in. Refinancing isn't an option right now but would be later this year (due to a first time homebuyer program).

My savings isn't where I want it to be (around $5k) and neither is my retirement fund (around $23k, I'm 32).

My plan is to finish maxing out my 2019 Roth IRA and max out the 2020 amount first. But after that, I feel like I have a few options and I'm unsure which is best.

Option 1: Pay off car, put the remaining money into savings. Without a car payment, I'd be able to easily up my 401k contribution and put more each month either into savings or my mortgage payment.

Option 2: Put all of the remaining money into savings, drop my current monthly savings a little and put extra money towards retirement and the car each month.

Option 3: Put X amount (maybe $10k?) into savings then put the rest into the mortgage.

Any thoughts? Are there other options I'm not thinking of? I’m leaning towards the first option but I’m not used to have this much cash at my disposal so it makes me a little nervous.

Forex,Explanation of safe havens,"when you are looking at safe havens  you need to look at the reason WHY they are considered safe havens to  decide which will be best for any given situation. People consider the  United States to be the safest for protecting their principal. Market

participants around the world can protect their principal by buying up short term U.S.

government debt, or medium term or long term. For the United States has never defaulted on it’s

debts, at least not currently. The United States has survived a civil war, multiple world wars, and

always came out the other side in decent shape. It has a strong federal government, with the

states having their own authority. There is the separation of powers and delegation of authority.

The country usually has a strong executive branch, no matter who is president. This strong

executive branch helps to get things done in terms of not wasting too much time squabbling with

hundreds of lawmakers on many decisions.

So  to put it simply, its all united under one government, and is the most  liquid market in the world, so when people want to protect assets, they  invest in USD

In a global financial crisis and worldwide recession/depression, then commodity prices would

drop a lot, and the commodity currencies of AUD, NZD, and CAD would get hit hard because a

large portion of their gross domestic product, economies, jobs, and high interest rates depend on

rising commodity prices

So,  whenever their is global crisis and recessions, the US dollar gets much  stronger because even if people have to acccept lower returns, it  ssafe.

JPY

The Japanese Yen tends to strengthen during periods of risk aversion. It tends to strengthen

during periods of reduced global growth recession/depression. In fact, during the 2008 financial

crisis the Japanese Yen was the biggest currency safe haven of them all. Even above the U.S.

dollar. If you look at a chart you will see that the USD/JPY exchange rate went down from 110

to 88. That means the Japanese Yen got stronger. Even the safe haven U.S. dollar weakened

against its Japanese counterpart. And it is important to understand why this is the case. A lot of

it has to do with the way the capital flows from the Japanese and American economies.

Japan does not really rely on foreign capital. Thus, when there is risk aversion, their isn’t much

foreign capital that wants to flee Japan because there wasn’t a large presence to begin with. This

means that there isn’t going to be a reason to sell the JPY during risk aversion periods. Now the

market just needs some reason to buy the JPY and it can appreciate during risk aversion.

The Japanese companies taking out loans start to cash in their earnings in foreign currencies and

bringing that money back to Japan. They bring that money back to Japan because there is risk

aversion and they don’t want to hold through the exchange rate risk that risk aversion can bring.

Remember risk aversion can be simple profit taking, or it can be a financial crisis, or global

growth slowing, or globe entering a recession/depression.

The outsiders that came to Japan to take out yen denominated loans start to buy the Japanese yen

back in order to start repaying those loans. They do not want to hold through the risk aversion as

well.

And finally the speculators who were long the yen crosses because of the interest rate differential

or betting on capital appreciation of the exchange rate need to close out those trades.

All the above market participants know that everyone else will do the same thing, so it is a race to

the exits as to who can repatriate the money to Japan the fastest.

CHF

The Swiss Franc typically benefits from a different sort of risk aversion. It is usually linked to

some sort of war, political risk/turmoil. As long as that doesn’t cause a global financial crisis/

worldwide recession/depression. Because if it did cause a global financial crisis/worldwide

recession or depression then the U.S. dollar save haven bid can be activated and market

participants can sell Swiss francs for U.S. dollars some of the time.

Switzerland is known to be a diplomatically neutral country, a tax haven. A lot of money from

various places including oil money travels through Switzerland.

When there is a crisis in the Middle East a lot of money tends to travel into Switzerland. A lot of

oil money looking for a safe haven in the Swiss Franc. Not just from the Middle East, but also

from countries such as Russia, which have a large amount of corruption tied to their huge energy

sector.

worldpolitics,Rise of Bernie vs the Boomer class,"I thought this was a concise read on the rise of Bernie and what Boomers are doing (if they acknowledge it or not).


But, the reality is that economic opportunity for young people in the U.S. is seriously impaired, especially relative to what older generations went through. They are saddled with huge educational debts (that boomers didn't have to pay), and the housing costs in areas with healthy labor markets are exorbitant. The previous pathways to the middle class and financial security - home ownership, retirement savings/pension, healthy pay increases - are essentially out of reach for a distressingly large share of these younger cohorts. In addition to decreasing funding for education and doing nothing to ease housing shortages (if anything most localities have made things worse), governments - who are largely made up of and controlled by boomers and boomer voters - have added massive amounts of debt to federal government while lowering the funding going to things that will increase future economic growth (R&amp;D, infrastructure, health care). They are preventing policies that will ease climate change, etc. Essentially, boomers were given the capital that was the result of 200 years of economic growth (and previous generations investing in infrastructure, education, R&amp;D), and then just setting policies to just extract from the past and the future for their benefit. 

I support Biden because I want Trump gone. Boomers are a huge cohort and they vote. We know they won't support someone that will redistribute society's resources from their own extraction to investing in the future. And, thus, those candidates supporting policies like that will likely fail. But, i completely understand why these young voters support someone like Bernie. 

And, while Biden might knock out Trump - especially if the virus wreaks havoc on the economy, he won't deal with underlying conditions that brought Trump. There's a small elite for whom our current economy works great and slightly bigger group for whom it works OK. Almost everyone else is just treading water, or for the younger cohorts, sinking.",finance
personalfinance,"Home Loan in One Name, Title in Two Names (US)","I’ll start with the TLDR. Is it a bad idea for a married couple who are buying a house to have the loan in one person’s name, and the title in both names?

Seems like it could be a recipe for disaster, but here’s the situation.

I’m a 47-year old dude in the greater Boston area, and have never owned property. I married my wife (46) in April 2019, and she owns a condo in Cambridge which she is currently renting out, and the intention is to keep it as a rental unit for the foreseeable future, and on which she still owes approx. $100K. Neither of us have been married before.

I’m not on the title of her condo, and I’m not really concerned about that, but we filed our taxes jointly for the first time. We both have very little debt otherwise (her car is paid off, mine will be paid off next year, we both have low credit card balances, no student loans, etc.)

We are looking to buy a house in the greater Boston area, and houses are expensive right now. We’re probably looking at $600K or so. We talked to a lender, and it turns out my credit (828, 805, 816) is much better than her credit (638, 620 &amp; 592). Her low credit is primarily the result of paying bills late. Not because she didn’t have the money, but because she’d just let them stack up and wasn’t very organized.

The loan guy said it’d probably be best to put the loan in my name, and the title in both names, so the rate and mortgage insurance would be tied to my credit scores. My questions are:

* What are the risks and implications of such a strategy?

* If we *did* take the above approach, would I qualify for a ""first-time home buyers"" loan? Since I'm not on the title of her condo?

* And with financial markets all over the place right now, and the Fed cutting interest rates drastically, is this a good time to be buying a house?

Side note – if it matters, we currently have roughly $70-80K saved to put towards a down payment and closing costs.

personalfinance,Jumbo vs Conforming Mortgage Decision,"I am in the fortunate position of shopping for a mortgage right now.  Rates are insanely low, and I need to determine how much to put down and what type of loan to take.  I have crunched some numbers, but would love others opinions on the best, purely financial, move.

I will have $450k liquid after the sale of my current residence (scheduled 4/4).  I am under agreement to close on a new place @ $865k on 5/1.

I have three scenarios that I am considering:

1. Maximize down payment (close to $450k) to minimize monthly payments.  This would get the best interest rate (2.875% for 30 yr fixed)
2. $355k down payment to keep mortgage conforming @ $510k.  This would also get the 2.875% rate but would free up $85k or so in capital to invest.
3. 20% down payment ($175k), jumbo loan @ 3.375%.  This would free up \~$250k in capital to invest.

In scenario 2 and 3, I would have higher monthly payments, but would see benefits in investing the capital earlier and reaping compounding returns.  As far as affording higher payments, I would divert some of the money I typically allocate to investments each month into my mortgage payment.  Additionally, I assume I would have a higher write-off due to paying more interest in #2 and #3, and therefore would significantly reduce my tax liability annually.

I am open to any other alternatives or analysis.  This is a major decision for me and I want to make sure I am thinking about this in a level-headed way.",finance
MachineLearning,[Discussion] What would be a good approach to finding strong predictors of a response where I expect strong non-linear interactions between variables?,"I realize this may be more of a r/statistics question than r/machinelearning, but it feels like this community would have some good ideas, so I'm asking here.

The gist of my problem has to do with predicting whether two random species of bacteria will interact in a specific way. I have label data on this: for each species pair, they either interact (1) or don't interact (0).

I also have some relevant genomic data on each of these species. Basically, whether each species has a gene which may be related to the interaction, or not. However, we don't really know which genes cause the interaction, and it is likely that different genes cause the interaction under different circumstances.

To clarify with a sort-of unrelated example, the interaction might be ""mutualism"". This could result if species X has gene a and species Y has gene b, or if species X has gene c and species Y has gene d, etc. I would like to be able to predict which sets of genes, between two species, result in my interaction.

So my data look like this:

each species has a boolean vector representing presence / absence of potentially important genes:

x_i = [0,0,1,0,0,1,1,...] where x is the gene vector for species i. Each vector x_i has the same length, n.

Then I also have the response data: y_ij = 0 or 1, where y_ij is the interaction result between species i and j, and 0 is no interaction and 1 is interaction.

I imagine my data would be fed to a statistical approach in which the labeled data are my y, and my feature data are the gene vectors concatenated for the relevant species.

In other words, a row of data would look like this:

column 1 = y_ij # whether species i and j interact columns 2:(n+1) = x_i # the gene set (of length n) of species x columns (n+2): (2*x + 1) = x_j # the gene set of species y

This sort of looks like logistic regression to me, but I think it is more complicated because the interaction may result from the presence of different predictors, making it not straight-forward.

If it matters, I have ~1002 rows of data, and the feature length is ~60.

Any suggestions? Thanks!",technology

I do not claim to know when a crisis will occur. But if we are already at such low rates now, when it really isn't that bad, what are we going to do when banks start going under? Is every central bank going to go negative on their rates, tens of trillions of QE?

Oh, boy, I am super worried, this is going to be worse than 2008 because the world has far more debt and far lower interest rates than we did back then prior to the crisis. We also counted on China for our recovery the last time, but we will have no such luck this time because their economy is probably in worse shape than the US is due to demographics and a housing bubble in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen so large, that they easily rival the bubbles of NYC, SF, Toronto or Vancouver.

personalfinance,"Comcast Sent $112 balance from 2017 to collections in 12/2019, I had no knowledge of debt","I recently got a credit change notification with a significant (60+ point) drop in my credit score. I used the free annual credit report website to look into it, and I found that a collection company had opened an account for a $112 debt with the original creditor being Comcast.

I had no idea what this could be for since I have automatic billing setup on my account. I logged in and verified that my account was paid and then I called Comcast for clarification. The person in the billing department was pretty much useless. She could only see that my account had been up-to-date since I started the service in 2018.

Hitting a dead end there, I called the collection agency to get more information. What they told me is that debt is from an account with an address I lived at four years ago. I had been late paying my final bill when I moved out, but by the collection agency's own records, I paid the full balance of three-hundred-something dollars in 2017. There was no collection action on that late payment and I did pay the full amount. I didn't get much clarification of where this additional $112 charge was coming from, but the collection agency rep seemed to be saying that Comcast charged me for an additional month after the ""final bill"" was paid.

So the charge itself doesn't seem to be valid to me. But I don't doubt there ability to come up with some bullshit reason as to why it is. 

That being said, I have had zero communication from Comcast that I owed them this debt over the last 3+ years. I didn't have service with them for about a year between 2017 until 2018 when I started service again. I didn't even think that they allowed you to start new service if you owed a balance. So no mention at that time of any amount due. I have received no paper mail from them unless they sent it to the address that the service was at in 2016/2017, which wouldn't make sense since I have always kept my address up-to-date with the post office and credit bureau. No communication by email either. I tend to ignore unknown phone numbers, but I have not received any voicemails regarding this.

The collection agency received the debt from Comcast in December 2019 and hit my credit report for collections in February 2020.

\-------------------------------------------------

So my questions are:

1. Can Comcast sit on an alleged debt for three years without notifying me in any way?
2. How valid is this charge if it was supposedly charged after I paid my final bill with them?
3. What are my options for fighting this?

Not being sure what to do, I submitted a complaint to the FCC earlier today. I figured this could at least get me in touch with someone higher up at Comcast that may be able to shed some insight into what this charge even is and if they ever attempted to contact me about it. I'm not sure what to do next though. I know I could dispute the collection with the credit bureaus, but it seems like it would just go to the collection agency who could just say: ""yup, we received this from Comcast so it's valid to us.""

The next steps I can think of are sending the collection agency a certified letter requesting proof of debt (or should I send this to Comcast or both?), submitting a federal reserve compliant, and filing in small claims court.",finance

CryptoCurrency,Central Banks and Crypto,"From the FT today: (paywall - https://www.ft.com/content/27cf0690-5c9d-11ea-b0ab-339c2307bcd4)

&gt;With the rise of populism there are growing calls for monetary finance of increased fiscal deficits — that is, direct financing of government deficits by central banks of the kind currently happening in Japan. Monetary finance has [traditionally] been a precursor of high inflation and while its proponents argue that the risks can be contained provided the quantity of such finance is controlled by independent central banks, central bank independence has been increasingly under threat since the crisis.

The author points to the near certainty that there will be another crisis (this time originating in corporate debt he thinks), as well as the even nearer certainty that many governments will fail to adjust fiscal policy to deal with rising deficits. There is far less room for central bank intervention than was the case in 2008, so the only alternatives are for politicians to demand more from taxpayers, or else inflate debt away through money printing. Populist regimes always opt for the latter.

Gold and Bitcoin can only benefit. And if the price of BTC rises above a key threshold, the IMF may well feel obliged to include Bitcoin in the SDR calculations. Governments everywhere would then need to properly regulate the instrument. This is the Big Moment that will drive Bitcoin to a million a coin, but it is, alas, not imminent - most governments would still rather Bitcoin go away, and they refuse to regulate as a way of avoiding the issue, as well as keeping professional money out. Even so, the days of this kind of head-in-the-sand policy are coming to an end as more forward-looking governments begin to recognize Bitcoin as a legitimate asset.  

Central banks are trying to put together digital currencies that offer some of the advantages of crypto, but with state control over the money supply levers. Again, this will be good for Bitcoin as it will become even easier to switch value between digital fiat and trustless crypto with a programmed monetary policy. It can only be a matter of time before wallets will do this on the fly, automatically.",cryptocurrency
investing,Trying to understand interest rates,"I’m trying to understand how interest rates work, is my understanding below correct?

If the Fed reduces interest rates, that effectively makes money “cheap”. So borrowing would be cheap, but those who are in debt, have to effectively pay more because the money they have isn’t worth as much. 

This would ideally incentivize new businesses and ventures and enable people to make riskier bets, which is good in theory, trying to artificially create demand to match the supply. 

Right now, when even the supply is weakened (due to China and decrease in worldwide manufacturing etc), how did the most recent rate cut help? 

If anything, it artificially tried to pump demand but there isn’t a strong supply to match. And if we keep lowering them, soon enough, that would trigger inflation?",finance

personalfinance,What equation should I be doing to determine if a refinance is worthwhile?,"My situation:

Loan type: 30yr. Conventional

Years remaining: 28yr (although probably a bit less because I over-pay it)

Rate: 4.5%

Total loan: $289,750.00

Remaining: $278,872.87

Current PMI: $99/month for 3 more years.

Plan to keep house: 4-6 more years most likely, but subject to change


---

It was my first home purchase and it sounds like I got in at pretty much the worst time possible (rates jumped from ~3.5%-&gt;4.5% a couple days before I put an offer in). I constantly get these refinance offers in the mail, but they never have websites or ways to get more information outside of calling so I just assume they're scams, or at the very least have ulterior motives to just saving me money.

But I just got another one today with a rate much lower than I've seen before. The rate they're offering is 2.875%, which sounds like a huge improvement over my current 4.5%, and I trust this a little more since I've heard about the fed dropping rates lately due to the coronavirus scare.

But even with a little more legitimacy, they still only have a phone number listed, mention my loan company by name but are not associated with them, and as always include no other way for me to get more information.

-----

So I figured I'd ask reddit first:


1.) Are these offers a scam? If not, what are they getting out of it?

2.) If it's legit, are there any tricks I should watch out for while talking with them? The conditions they list are:

- No payment until May 2020 (not really something I care about since I don't have problems with payments)
- Lender pays escrow, title, and appraisal - No closing costs
- Zero lender points (not sure what this is?)
- Up to 80% cash out option (I don't want/need money back, just want a lower rate)

3.) Is it possible to ditch my PMI with one of these offers? I currently have 3 years left, but I've been overpaying my mortgage since the purchase, and my house has increased in value (according to estimates and neighbor's comps) around $20-30k, so if we're going by house value, I'd be at about 84% remaining, but if we're going by original value it'd be closer to 91%. I believe 78-80% is what I need to hit to get it to drop under my current loan, but I wasn't sure if it was possible to get it dropped earlier with a refinance

4.) Does re-financing reset the age of my loan? Is it even worthwhile if I'm planning to sell within the next ~5 years?

5.) Anything else I should consider that I'm not thinking of?

investing,Rotschild last report (March 3th),"“As we enter 2020, we are cognisant that interest rates remain very low, which for some investors, makes equities the ‘only show in town’. Our view is that a significant amount of good news is already priced in, and the market is unlikely to show resilience against any sustained macro or geopolitical volatility. Furthermore, after such a strong run in many of our structural themes we are, if anything, more focused on managing risk rather than adding exposure. This backdrop means that incremental equity additions are likely to be more selective than ever.”

Long time lurker but created a throwaway for various reasons... I can verify with mods if they want.

Here's the situation...

My wife and I are starting to look at buying our first house! Hurray!!! 

She has no student loans. I have a total of 10 individual loans. 3 with Navient and 7 with Great Lakes. There's about $25k owed to each lender. Navient (Private) interest rates are between 10%-12%, Great Lakes (Federal) are between 3.4%-6.8%

What is the best way to combine all these loans into a single payment and interest rate?

The next question is when is the best time to do that if we want to buy a house? I don't want to open a $50k loan right before applying for a $200k one, or does that not really matter?

personalfinance,Need advice on helping parents get out of large credit card debt,"So here's how the story goes. I recently found out that my parents owe quite a bit of money to credit debt due to poor business decisions, my sibling and I's college education, and poor spending habits years ago. The total amount they owe is about 100k spread across multiple credit cards. They are slowly paying it off, but only a little bit per month. As for me, I currently live with them and help with the bills every month. However, with this news, I wish to help them as much as I can to get out of debt. Currently I have a fantastic job and have already saved a good deal for an emergency fund. I myself have no debt, so I can give about 70-80% of my pay monthly to the debt directly. The major money eater that we have are three credit accounts with the highest (\~16.7%) interest rate. 

Account 1 = \~$13,000 

Account 2 = \~$30,000

Account 3 = \~$11,000

They have other accounts (5 more) as well, but they're currently at between 0-7% interest rate, so I was told to put them on the lower end of importance, but they pretty much make up for the remainder of the amount owed. 

Together we are able to give about $6000-7000 per month depending. With the whole virus outbreak and public fear, less money is earned. 

Our plan is to tackle account 3 first and pay that off, then work our way to account 1, then finally to 2. However, my thinking was that we focus on account 2 first due to its high balance, and get that out to save money on interest. I'm not as educated in finance, so I most likely may be missing a crucial part here. But does this strategy sound reasonable? Is there a better way to go about this?",finance

personalfinance,19 years old's lifestyle inflation...,"I am addicted to online shopping and have trouble controlling my wants and needs. I really don't have any needs besides transportation, my parents makes sure I'm fed and have a roof over my head. Yet I'm spending nearly $500 each month when my transportation cost is at most $127. I set up a budget of $250 per month, leaving me $120 for entertainment/food/little things. And after adding up all my expenses per month since opening a bank account, I have...

July: $18.50 (The start of my part-time job, I usually have a $20 monthly allowance before my job)

August: $612.05 (I bought a new iPad for college)

September: $548.56 (Some books and access codes, the start of unnecessary buys.)

October: $1058.55 (About 600 is tuition and the remaining 400...no clue what I bought)

November: $247.30 (I MADE A BUDGET)

December: $398.24 (Christmas happened...also my 18th birthday...NYC expensive)

January: $365.56 (Inflation...maybe $105 on books...got a credit card...food is expensive in NY)

February: $446.65 (I need help...NYC is expensive)

I went from a girl spending around $20 per month to a girl spending $450 a month. The worst part, in February, that is about $300 spent on USELESS THINGS. I have zero recollection of what I bought. The only thing I know is that about 90% of it was spent on food. Part of the reason is that I grew up poor, still am poor, but am able to get what I want now. 

When I was younger, my parents would do their best to get what I want. One example that pains me forever is my 8th birthday. I wanted a cake and asked my dad for one. I never had one before but saw on tv a big round cake. My dad bought home a slice. I remember the disappointment and the tears that pooled. But I knew we can't afford one. Yet I had always been a slightly spoiled child, so I had a moment where I silently blamed dad. Now I have my own money, I buy what my little heart desire. An apple pen, bags, phone cases, and foooooooooood. 

Now I also have a sister 13 years younger than me, and I can't help but provide her with what my parents can't. Pizza occasionally, ice cream was not luxury anymore, whole cake on birthdays. I can't help but buy Go-Gurt, something all kids at school had when I was younger, while I ate rice with a single link of sausage. I can't help but provide her an experience, to save her the embarrassment of not knowing what pizza was. I don't want her to feel the jealousy that bubbles when other kids have what she never had.  

I know very well all of these mean nothing to her. I only care because I had always been materialistic. She is a happy child with no worries in the world.  

But on the bright side, I have $0 debt. I don't rely on my parents for spending cash and have a relatively large amount of emergency fund that earns me $10 interest per month (FREEEE MONEY). My cc had been giving me cash back about...$5 a month (Still...FREE MONEY). 

I can buy whatever my heart desire with no huge consequences. And so on the month of February...I ended my balance on $5 and 0 dollars went to savings.  To compare...75% of my income went to savings the months prior, which was how I built my savings. 

To be fair to myself, my income had been halved due to my needs to focus on school and can't work. I also am able to afford all of these things. I'm not in any sort of debt or have the need to go into debt. I am just a little disappointed in myself for lack of self-control, and how materialistic I've become. I am also shocked at how rapidly lifestyle inflation grows.   

So, welp.",finance
personalfinance,Payed off my car but can't stop thinking about how bad I got scammed,"Hello all. I want to share my first car buying experience and hear your thoughts on the matter. I payed off my car last December but after doing the math I can't stop thinking about how much I overpayed and still feel like an idiot for falling into the dealer's traps. 

This was a purchase I made after having recently graduated from a masters in mid 2017 and moving to a new state for my first full time job. I wanted to start as soon as possible so I only had 5 days off after defending my thesis to move across states and get settled in. This involved finding a place to live in, buying furniture, organizing the new place, getting a car, etc. I was so busy before graduating that I was not able to carefully research how to go about doing all this.

I first came to the US for college almost 10 years ago but I was not born here and did not have wiser people to consult with about life decisions in a foreign country. In addition, after living life as a poor student and landing the highest paying job of my life thus far, I felt like I deserved to treat myself. Unfortunately, all these factors resulted in a bad financial decision: buying a new car from a dealership without doing any research. 

I will cut through the details of my terrible negotiation but, in summary, I ended up financing a new Nissan Rogue 2017 SV through the dealership and accepted a bunch of extras that I thought were typical of any car sale. Specifically the extras were: gap insurance for $1499, 6 year extended warranty for $1935, key warranty for $999 (it shows in the contract as ""other aftermarkets"" wtf) and 3 year maintenance plan for $1700 (later I found out this only covered oil changes and tire rotation, what a ripoff). In the contract, the total sale price of the car turned out to be $39,190.75 while the invoice price is $23,894 when I look it up online. This makes me sick. The financing I got with my 540ish credit score at the time was with an interest rate of 5.45% and with monthly payments of $459.21 for 75 months. 

Throughout the whole process of being at the dealership and buying the car I felt like I was paying too much but I just wanted to be done with it and felt that all these fees were probably normal anyway. Now I know I didn't do the research and it's all my fault since I alone signed the contract so please spare me your judgment. 

Thinking about the car debt always made me feel like I had gotten cheated so I made it a priority to pay it off as soon as possible. I ended up paying the car this past December after 31 months. When I payed it in full, I fought to get the most possible refunds as I could from the extras I had payed. I got refunded $874.67 for the gap, $1058.60 for the extended warranty and $117.58 for the key warranty. My final payment totaled to $33,894.53 ($10,000.53 above the invoice price). 

I also went to the dealership to express my discontent with my purchase. First they made me meet with an employee who said the dealership wanted to buy back my car so I could get a new car from them. I told her how I felt I had overpayed too much for my car and told her I would never buy a new car from them again. She kept insisting telling me how they would give me a great deal to make up for the first time but I kept refusing. Then I was able to meet with the salesman who had negotiated the car price with me (he was now a manager). He told me I had gotten a good deal and when I told him I felt the extras that were sold to me didn't seem optional, he said that was the financing person's fault and that he no longer worked there. I insisted that he was aware of the extra charges they were throwing at me to make more profit but he kept refusing to admit anything. In the end he apologized for my bad experience and said: ""I know this won't fix it but take these"" and handed me two coupons for free oil change and tire rotation. 

Ever since that experience I have become more studious regarding personal finances. Currently I am investing the yearly maximum in my company's 401k, HSA, employee stock purchase plans and Roth IRA. I payed off all my debts and I am living on less than what I make. I am also a frugal person and try to save as much as I can. However, despite all these efforts I can't stop thinking about how much money I wasted on my car. I can't stop thinking about how I wish I had bought a used car and how much more money I could have saved and invested on something more valuable. I certainly will never buy a new car again and probably plan on driving this one to the ground. It is becoming a little obsessive to the point I feel I need to save even more money to compensate for what I lost. I find myself still eating healthy every day but eating the minimum amounts to have more leftovers. I also haven't gotten a haircut in 3 months (I usually get them every 4 weeks) because I don't want to pay for it. 

With all of this said, I would like to read your comments. Perhaps you went through something similar and have some advice to offer. Is there a way to stop thinking about the money wasted and getting cheated at the dealership? Maybe there's something else I could go back to the dealer with to get some type of compensation? Or maybe I should sell my car (I am seeing listings for my model and year for about $18,000 with my 25k mileage on Carvana) and buy a cheaper, used one in good conditions. Thank you for reading this and I look forward to reading your responses.

TL;DR: Payed $10,000 more than the invoice price for a new car. I am obsessing a little about saving more to compensate for my mistake. What is your advice to stop thinking about it and/or recuperate loss?",finance

personalfinance,Lower down payment/higher mortgage rate vs. higher downpayment/lower mortgage rate,"We're purchasing a condo for 675k and our lender is giving us the option of going with a 25% down payment for a 3.125% interest rate vs. a 20% down payment for a 3.595% interest rate for a 30 year loan.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

personalfinance,Using 401k to lock in lower tax rate on Roth contributions?,"Hi all - I've done a ton of reading in the hopes of answering my question, but I can't seem to find anything quite this specific. Hopefully this great community can help me with a quick sanity check on my retirement savings strategy.

I (26M) currently make $63,860, living in NYC, putting me in the 22% federal bracket (state and local taxes bump that up \~10%). I have been putting as much money as possible (25%) into my traditional 401k as possible, thinking that I need to shield my money as much as possible from taxes here.

That said, recently, I've begun to value a more diversified approach to these tax-advantaged accounts, and I'd like to bolster my Roth savings. My plan is to scale back from my 25% pre-tax contributions and instead put 18% into a traditional 401k (plus a 5% match) and 5% into a Roth 401k (in addition to maxing out my Roth IRA for the year).

My thinking is that the standard deduction of $12,400 plus the 18% pre-tax contribution will bring my taxable income into the 12% federal bracket. And that my after-tax contributions will be taxed at that amount - effectively getting me the best of both worlds. I realize that I'm still locking myself into state &amp; local taxes, but \~22% all in isn't that bad in my mind, since we're at historically low tax rates, and I have reason to believe I'll have significantly more liquid assets at retirement time.

They had been at 95% utilization, last month I paid them down to 80%, and I have just paid them down to $65% total.

I also have a personal loan of $12000, paid down to $6980 outstanding.

I took an emergency loan of $2500 in early Dec which is now paid off and closed.

And finally, I had a hard pull of credit in Feb. and was rejected for a card.

And I also have outstanding IRS debt of about $9000 at 10% annual interest in a payment plan which I will pay off last since that is the best rate I have.) 

My credit score right now is between 624-640.

All interest rates are currently just below 30% APR, so I’d like to improve credit score to replace my cards with lower interest ones eventually.

Thanks for any advice.

Edit: (Additional information in my budget.)
I have a mortgage, HELOC, and outstanding auto loan ($14000) at 10%. I can’t pay any of those off yet.

I will now be having about $2000/month above bills, utilities, food, and gas expenses which is where I am planning to get the money for paying things off.

The payment on the personal loan is $509/month with over $325/month towards principal.

Card payments had been totaling about $360/month minimum.",finance
personalfinance,I switched to Schwab Intelligent Portfolio last year and my taxes are a disaster.,"I'm still in the middle of this, but looks like I owe [$30,000 on my taxes](https://i.imgur.com/yo2X9te.png) for this year, 2019.  state and federal combined, [wtf did I do to myself](https://i.imgur.com/UjwEf2D.png)


Yes it's my fault.  Yes, I kinda knew this was going to happen, but I forgot about it until I started doing my taxes last night.

So I had a bunch of money in a non-tax advantaged account with stocks and ETFs in it, I've had this account for over a decade.  I've been mostly adding to it and barely ever taking anything out this whole time.  

Well I hear about this Schwab Intelligent Portfolio and I think, hey that's great, I don't have to think about re-balancing my portfolio anymore, they'll do it for me.  I ask the guy on the phone ""this is gonna make my tax return really long because of all the robo-buys and sells, right?""  And he says yeah but you just import the file into the H&amp;R block system and it does all the work for you.  Ok fine.

Well I move all my funds over there and the robot investor immediately makes over a hundred trades to get my portfolio ""balanced."" Yikes.  Well, now I'm finally seeing what damage I did. 

Because of all the selling and re-buying, my taxable income went through the roof. On a total of about $500,000 that I had in this account,  the robot investor made $420,000 in long-term sells and $340,000 in short-term sells.  https://i.imgur.com/lwMptA1.png  

So now I have to sell off more of my stocks to gather up thirty fucking thousand dollars to pay the tax man.  All while the stock market is doing this stupid coronavirus rollercoaster.

AND now my income for the year is over the Roth IRA limit, so the $6000 I put in there last year has to come out or else I get penalized on that too!

My wife is gonna kill me.  My dad, a retired accountant, is gonna kill me.  I know I'm smarter than this.  I never would have made $700,000 in trades in one year if I hadn't switched to this new account.  I always knew that eventually I have to pay taxes on this money, but now due to my fuckup I get to pay them all in one year. 

I'm not looking for sympathy, I know I still have lots of money and this is not really meant to be a sob story.  I just thought I'd share my experience with this ""intelligent portfolio.""  I guess I didn't factor in my own complete absence of intelligence when I signed up for this thing.",finance
personalfinance,Denied IBR on student loans. What should I look to do now?,"Edit - Email just said IDR, not IBR specifically.

We owe about $54,000 in principal, and just under $1k in interest overall. We've been able to make very substantial payments.

We can pay off the interest today. That is the next step correct so that it doesn't get consolidated? Obviously we don't want to pay interest on the interest. Is there anything else we can do?

My rate is not terrible, It's actually pretty good.   Since then I took out a HELOC and installed solar panels on my roof and purchased my wife a new used car.  The HELOC is variable and currently at 4% but was as high as 5% a while back.  If i recall correctly it's based on prime, and bottoms at 4%.  My goal is to pay as close to $1,000/mo to the HELOC everyone month.  But it's been a bit harder than i hoped to do so.  So most months i put $800 towards it.  It's balance is $37k.  I did receive my federal rebate and paid it towards that already.  I'm waiting on one from Duke now that should arrive soon which will bring it to just about $31k.

personalfinance,Am I out of options with my student loans? (Sallie Mae),"TLDR; Took out too many loans. Was making almost 1k payments a month. Sallie Mae decreased them to $330 for 2 years. They’re going back up to $650, and I still can’t afford them.


Sorry for the book:

After graduating college, I started getting bills for $985 payments toward my Sallie Mae student loans. I was living with my grandmother without a car, so I adjusted accordingly to pay these for a good year or so.

Eventually, I decided to do something about it, as I wanted to live a normal life, so I called them up. After several weeks of back-and-forth, they had finally set me up with a two year re-payment plan, which decreased my monthly payments and interest rates, and subsequently the life of my loans. I was then making $330 monthly payments, which was a life changer. 

This month, the two year plan will expire and I will be going back to $650 payments. At an annual salary of 37k, I’m still not quite where I need to be in order to afford it alongside other loans with Navient, rent, car insurance, credit card bills, etc. I called Sallie Mae and the rep. I spoke with said, “You had two years to increase your income. Why haven’t you? And if you can’t afford it, you and your co-signer should be splitting it.” I explained that I DID raise my income, but not enough to afford payments nearly the size of a mortgage, and that my co-signer paying any of it isn’t an option. 

Consolidating would be the obvious choice, but my credit history’s not quite long enough to qualify. Raising my income further would be second, but I live in an area that doesn’t have a lot of employment options, and can’t afford to move while paying these loans. I make reeeeaally good money where I live.

I’m not really sure what else to do here. I’ve been paying these off for 8 years, and have never missed a payment. All I want to do is decrease the payments to a reasonable amount, so I can chuck money at them once a month and not think anything else of it.

For context, myself nor my co-signer had any idea what we were doing. I was 17 and my parents wanted me to get the “full college experience” living on campus, which is why my debt is so crippling.",finance
investing,Box Spread Financing for extremely cheap 0.85% Margin Interest Rates,"Want to max out your margin/buying power to make wild plays in this market but don't want to pay usury 8-10% margin interest rates to your broker? The answer is **SPX Box Spread Financing.**

Right now Mr. Market is offering you a 0.85% APR loan that isn't due until 1014 days from now. Selling the box on SPX on 16 DEC 22 will cost you 2.5%. 2.5%/1014 days to expiration * 365 = .85% annualized percentage rate. I got filled for 70k cost on a 2.8 million box spread. 70k/2.8 million = 2.5%.

10% interest rates for a fully secured loan is **usury.** I can balance transfer to my checking account for 3% for a year on my credit card.

# How box spread financing works

https://www.theocc.com/components/docs/about/press/white-papers/2016/box-spreads-options-strategies-for-borrowing-or-lending-cash.pdf

Short the box = borrower.      
Long the box = lender.    

Everyone here remembers GUH. The issue with Robinhood was they added the credit received from box spreads and other option selling premium as if it were a cash contribution. **There is a legitimate use of box spreads though!** However at a real broker say TD Ameritrade the cash is held secure. However it offsets your debit balance! You're no longer paying 10% interest to your broker but to the market!

# Pros and cons of box spreads

Pros:   
        
* Insanely cheap interest rates for margin. 
* No credit check, no application, Mr. Market gives to anyone smart enough to know how to short the box. 
* Fixed due date. Hint: **EUROPEAN OPTIONS.**
* Can pay back the loan at any time,  possibly profiting. 
* Fully and automatically deductible 60%/40% LTCG/STCG tax treatment unlike margin interest which requires you to itemize. 
* Possibly less broker interference with margin calls/more leeway since the loan isn't on their books and isn't due for years. 

Cons:     
     
* Reg-T margin reduces your buying power by the loan cost amount. You need portfolio margin to have access to 100% borrowing. $0 BPR on portfolio margin. 
* Portfolio margin traders can suffer margin calls if you have a bad mark/quote. This is a huge problem at Interactive Brokers. TD Ameritrade seems to be a lot smarter about this. You need to place a GTC close order at a very favorable unrealistic price to always quote your box. 
* Portfolio margin will reduce your equity by the current quoted cost to close the loan. Equity margin call risk with *rising interest rates* even though your interest rate is **fixed.**
* Brokers **hate** box spreads. See mechanics section.  
* Possibly forgetting about your margin debt since your cash balance is positive. 
* Interactive brokers will liquidate legs of the box automatically if margin called lol. Set the box to ""liquidate last"" in TWS.
* Doesn't offset short sale margin interest rates. Internally your broker clearing house lumps options trades + long equity in your margin account so the cash is offset. However you have a *separate* account for short sales of stock. You'll still get hit with 8-10% interest on short sales. Get over to IBKR pronto if direct short selling is your strategy.

# Mechanics of Box Spread Financing 

First: Find a European style 1256 contract eligible index options chain like SPX.

Borrower: Short 1,000 points of SPX = borrowing $100k.       
Lender: Long/Debit 1,000 points of SPX = lending out $100k.      

Type of options trade: COMBO/ Iron Condor option. **You must do all 4 legs at once.**

Limit/Market order: **LIMIT**  If I need to explain why then box spread financing isn't for you. 

Pair up a vertical call spread with a put spread in both the **same** strikes.

Place your combo order and carefully use confirm dialog/ option modeling software to absolutely be sure it's uniform max loss no matter how SPX moves. Start off with the most favorable price you want then slowly work it. Box spreads take time to fill and quote. Lender algorithm trading boxes hunt for them and it takes time for the options exchange to match order flow. It's essentially a shadow auction at the exchange.

**You need to direct route these orders to an exchange.** You can try smart routing first but it seems to work better getting quoted. Direct routing may bypass some limitations your broker attempts to prevent you from getting better interest rates. 

# Wide strikes vs multiple contracts

Obviously less contracts = less commissions. You can think of commissions as a lending charge/etc.

Brokers **hate** retail plebs getting institutional margin rates through the market. I had a lot of trouble filling my $2.8m box in a real account on TOS. TD Ameritrade simply won't send a box order to an exchange if there is no quote. So I had to resort to multiple contracts. 

Multiple contracts near the money = faster fill, possibly at better rates. Simply put there is more action and liquidity at the money. The options exchange software can possibly match your box legs to 4 different traders at the money and fill everyone making everyone happy. *Box spread lending is one reason why the zero sum argument in options trading is bunk.* 4 traders get whatever position they want and internally they're all lending money to you. That's a win/win where both sides profit.

Fewer contracts way out the money = only getting fills from people who **want** to be box spread lenders. 

In my experience I found, while more costly, near the money boxes are much easier and less frustrating to be filled. 

# Conclusion 

I hope learning about box spread financing helps you YOLO even more efficiently.

Edit 2:     
You need a margin account to make use of this. Box spreads DON'T give you leverage (when the broker implements it correctly). You can't use a cash account to borrow on box spreads, only lend. 

Edit:

# TL;DR spoon feed me the trade/position 

Stick to your 10% margin interest rates/ robinhood gold subscription. This isn't a trade but a *financing strategy.*",finance
personalfinance,Refinancing Home to Consolidating Debt,"Hi All, I have been reading through a few other posts about refinancing a mortgage and had an idea to refinance all of my current debt and roll it into a new house payment. I was hoping to get opinions and thoughts on what my next steps should be and to see if I am missing anything.

I purchased my house a little of 7 years ago for $116,000, and the loan was $110,000 overall. The loan was 30 years at 3.5%, and I pay $886 a month which covers PMI, insurance, taxes and everything else. House values in my neighborhood have risen significantly during that time and similar houses are selling between 170k to 190k.

financialindependence,Does SWR Apply with Record Low Interest Rates?,"The 10 Year Treasury which is the basis for SWR research is currently sitting at a record low of 0.74%. Not just below average, but all time record low. I am curious to hear some discussion of what this might mean for SWR research and FIRE strategies.

With bond yields at record lows, FIRE investors are faced with a choice between locking up a large portion of their portfolio in risk free assets with an expected *nominal* return of under 1%, or take their chances with a more aggressive stock allocation. (You might look at 10-15 year performance of bond funds and note that they have returned more than their yield, but that is only due to the long term trend of lower interest rates, culminating in what we are seeing today).

The Good

Record low interest rates is an indication of low underlying inflation. Institutions are only willing to loan money so cheap if they have confidence that the principal will have the same value with the interest paid back. Arguably, this new world of low yields is only possible with the removal of one of the principal threats to retirement success. This also means things like cheaper mortgages and other debt.

The Bad

However, this means there is no historical precedent for such low income (actually negative real return) coming from the bond side of the portfolio. Perhaps more importantly, the larger macroeconomic context is unprecedented, so we just don't know what effects this trend could have. For example, the Fed may have less room to stimulate the economy in the event of a recession. In that scenario, bonds (which go up in price as interest rates drop) could lose much of their diversification power with interest rates already at zero. A market crash when interest rates are already effectively zero could potentially be larger in scale and longer in duration than previous events we have seen (on the other hand, it is possible that the Fed is getting ahead of the potential recession, propping up the economy to pre-empt a major crash. This seems to be what the Fed is thinking with its emergency rate cut this week).

While SWR research is based on 100's of years of backtesting data, the current situation is unprecedented. I submit that we simply cannot say for sure that the SWR research will hold up.

Possible Strategies

1. Shift to higher yielding corporate bonds. However, corporate bonds are riskier and more correlated with the market than Treasuries, therefore expected to produce lower risk-adjusted returns. Muni bonds may have the same issue.
2. Increase your stock allocation. However, you will be more vulnerable to sequence of returns risk, especially in the scenario above where the Fed has no ability to correct a major market event.
3. Shift to TIPS. At least TIPS will be guaranteed to match inflation (although I have seen some reports of TIPS starting to sell with negative real rates). However, TIPS are somewhat less un-correlated with the market than traditional Treasuries and don't do as well in backtesting.
4. Explore annuities. Annuities can provide guaranteed income. However, they are subject to inflation risk, can be costly, and you lose the ability to pass the principal on to your heirs.

Basically, I don't see a good option that does not involve saving more. I am curious to hear thoughts on how FIRE folks are strategizing and coping with this inherent uncertainty.",finance

personalfinance,"Pre-Baby Planning: Help Us Manage an Oops, Reddit!","Hey r/personalfinance! Thanks for all of the great advice over the years. I'm hoping to get some feedback on how we can improve our finances in preparation of an oops baby. My partner and I are both in our desired career paths and working toward more but this child will primarily be a yearly financial burden more than personality or future burden for the two of us. We thought we couldn't get pregnant based on consultations with doctors after trying for three years. Six years later and I guess one good swimmer finally, somehow braved the extremely hostile conditions and made it through, so here we are.

So, the basics following our money:

&amp;#x200B;

|Item|Estimated Total|Notes|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Combined Gross Income (annual)**|$124,000||
|Item|Estimated Outflows|Notes|
|**Roth IRA contributions (annual)**|($12,000)||
|**457(b) contributions (annual)**|($19,500)|Pre-Tax|
|**401(a) contributions (annual)**|($3,400)|Pre-Tax|
|**Pension contributions (annual)**|($4,700)|Pre-Tax|
|**Health Insurance (annual)**|($6,000)|Pre-Tax|
|**Tax Liability (annual)**|($19,300)|Federal, State, FICA, estimated|
|**Mortgage (annual)**|($8,400)||
|**Insurance (annual)**|($3,000)|Home &amp; Auto|
|**Home Restoration (annual)**|($8,000)|Variable, restoring house with planned improvements - soft, padded estimate but sometimes something breaks and needs attention immediately|
|**Automobile Costs (annual)**|($3,000)|Variable, soft, padded estimate - Car paid off both walk to work|
|**School (annual)**|($5,000)|Doctoral studies - tuition waiver|
|**Food &amp; Drink (annual)**|($9,000)||
|**Clothing (annual)**|($2,000)||
|**Personal Services (annual)**|($2,500)|Personal Care Services - Massages, hair, etc.|
|**Travel (annual)**|($3,000)|Usually one trip per year|
|**Miscellaneous (annual)**|($5,800)|General household and retail|
|**Savings (annual)**|($9,000)|Extra savings toward house projects, possible new home, extra mortgage payments|

And our current financial standing is as follows:

|Item|Amount|Notes|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Savings**|$18,000|Low interest savings account, emergency fund+ funds to be used in coming months/years for projects or purchases|
|**Roth IRAs**|$64,000||
|**Other Retirement Accounts**|$70,000|457(b), 401(a), etc.|
|**House Equity**|$45,000|Downpayment+principal paid|
|**Vehicle**|$10,000|Estimated value - depreciating asset|
|**Total**|$207,000||
|**Mortgage Balance**|($120,000)||
|**Rough Net Worth**|$87,000|Assets-outstanding loans|

Based on cost estimates for babies in my area, my expected annual costs will be:

&amp;#x200B;

|Item|Estimated Costs|Notes|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Birth (one-time event)**|$10,000|US average, unsure of insurance coverage of total amount|
|**Infant Childcare (annual)**|$10,900|Local childcare center through partner's employment|
|**Miscellaneous (1st Year)**|$8,000|Baby essentials such as a car seat, diapers, clothing, etc.|

Now, assuming that the miscellaneous section of the baby cost isn't somehow astronomical, I feel pretty confident in the numbers presented above. And if we want to keep our current lifestyle and retirement savings rates, the easiest things to cut are annual travel and the rather high expenses spent on food and drink each year. That'll simply be a slight lifestyle change, but we'll be trading it in for quality time with the baby, so hopefully it all works out.

For those of you who somehow manage to be both smart financially and good parents, how are things looking? Right now we feel like we're sitting pretty and have a solid plan in place but this whole thing is a bit of a jolt and we're still thinking it may not stick even as we are almost out of the woods and the typical miscarriage window.

personalfinance,Buying points on a mortgage seems like a much stronger investment than is generally recognized,"So here’s a refi scenario pretty similar to my own:  450K owed on mortgage, 30 year fixed available for 3.375% at no cost.  Dropping the rate by 0.125% costs $1K and reduces monthly payment by $30.

So for the price of $1K, I get what is functionally equivalent to a 30 year annuity that reduces my fixed expenses by $360 annually.  Since fixed expenses can only be paid in after-tax dollars, comparison to a fixed income instrument in a taxable account is appropriate.  Between fed &amp; state I’m at a 33% marginal income tax rate, so it’s akin to a 30 year annuity that pays $540 annually pre-tax.

To me that looks like a monster of an investment (as long as I’m convinced I’ll be staying put).  As of now, I’ll be paying $2200 costs plus $3300 points to get down to 2.875% on a 30 year.",finance

I've created a tIRA account with Vanguard two days ago and funded the $6,000 contribution through my Ally savings account. I understand it will take a few more days for the contribution to settle but I'm not entirely sure what the next steps are once it does. Based on what I've read on this sub and on the internet, I think the next steps are as follows but please let me know if I'm mistaken:

**(1)  Once settled (as Federal Money Market Fund), click the ""Convert to Roth IRA"" link and open a Roth IRA.** 

\[***a few questions here:*** do I need to invest the settled money first?; should I open a separate Roth IRA account with Vanguard right now so I have an existing Roth account ready to dump money into?; if so, can I open the Roth IRA without any contributions, i.e. is it going to ask me to transfer money from my savings--that seems like it would defeat the purpose as I would go over the roth contribution limit\]

**(2) Choose to convert all of the account to the newly-created Roth IRA**

**(3) Select no tax withholding**

**(4)  Review and submit the conversion**

**(5) With the Roth IRA set up, invest the money in a desired target mutual fund.** 

Assuming this is the correct path forward, what do I do next year? Is it just a rinse and repeat (minus the creation of another Roth IRA account?)

personalfinance,Credit score is low not due to poor credit history but because credit history is not long enough--how do we fix this?,"My husband and I are 25 and 23, respectively. We are engineers at a major company with combined income of &gt;200k. We are extremely conscious of our money--we have budgeted and saved for all major purchases to avoid ever taking out a loan. No bankruptcies, no bad marks on our credit AT ALL except for \~3 late payments that seemed to have a very small impact on our scores.

This week we applied for a mortgage preapproval and were rejected by two of three lenders. Both of the lenders that rejected us use the middle of the 3 scores given by the major credit reporting agencies. The cutoff at one lender was 680 and the other was 700. My husband and I have monitored our scores for years and having always seen 730-740, thought this would be a non issue. We did not realize, of course, that the score we've been checking is reported by only one agency and has scored us highest of the 3 agencies.

One lender did approve us with an interest rate of 4.125% (high, given the current market) and closing costs of $25,000. We thought this was ridiculous, but it is now our only option. This lender also said that the single biggest factor in the elevated rate is our credit scores. 

The biggest negative in our current scores is the lack of ""credit depth and history"", which is bonkers because it seems we're being penalized for saving enough money to avoid needing loans. One lender said if we got the mortgage, within a few months of on time payments, our score would go way up. At that point we could refinance--but we're not sure if the high rate and closing cost would be worth it.

Our other idea is to buy a car, take out a loan this time, and make the payments on time. We are not sure this would work--would anyone be able to enlighten us here?

We are at a loss. What should we do to raise our scores? Take the worse mortgage, or take on some debt and wait to take on the mortgage? How can we accelerate the ""credit depth and history"" rating?",finance

Banking,Citibank - creating hurdles for firearm business,"I am a partner (treasurer) in a small new firearm distribution company, let’s call it XYZ. The company consists of 3 people including myself. I am the only American citizen in the company. We are registered in the state of Florida and after researching firearm friendly banks I was pointed toward Santander Bank and Citibank. We went ahead with Citibank. 

The banker made it know up front he is not a gun guy, which probably should have been my cue to work with another rep. 

Anyways, the gist of the business is we purchase firearms from a manufacturer, who is our affiliate located in Europe. The manufacturer ships the product to Florida, it will get inspected by the proper authorities at the airport then delivered to our location for storage via courier service like DHL/UPS. Once a licensed (FFL - Federal firearm license) buyer is found the courier service will deliver that product to our end user which are gun stores/gun ranges.

I would think opening up a bank account would be simple despite the restrictive nature of our business. I believe the incompetency of my banker is what is creating these hurdles, ultimately denying us from banking with Citi.

First Hurdle: the underwriter (who I have no contact with) came back to my bank rep and said that I, as the treasurer of XYZ, cannot open the bank account and that the president of XYZ needs to be at the branch in person. I don’t have a background in banking but this stuck me as very odd. I had to put pressure on my bank rep and asked how can a treasurer not be able to open up an account? That’s precisely the job of the treasurer. A day went by and he asked for more information about my partners (their date of birth, passports, and details regarding shares of each of us) — issue resolved.


Second Hurdle: Two days of waiting and I get this message from my rep:

“Unfortunately we will not be able to open a business account as Entities that manufacture and / or sell weapons, military technology and equipment to entities or governments outside the U.S are prohibited.”

Frustrated I called my rep to explain this does not pertain to my business. We DO NOT manufacture. I may be interpreting their message wrong but we also WILL NOT have customers outside of the US. My rep asked for me to write out a detailed explanation of the business so he can forward to the underwriters.

I wrote up an email explaining exactly what we do as if I was explaining it to a child.

Today I asked for a status update and my rep sent me the same paragraph in quotes as above explaining that’s why we were denied.


At this point I am out of options. I would like to get in touch with the actual underwriter/whoever is reviewing the file. I honestly think my rep does not have a good grasp on my business and that’s why we are getting denied

investing,Economics - What negative interest rates mean - Are we postponing an inevitable crash,"Recessions and depressions are devastating because they leave people unemployed, causing misery which eventually can turn into war and hate (ex. The aftermath of the great depression was WW2). The unit of account for the world is the USD. The economy functions because this unit of account remains stable. We, the regular folks (employees), expect that our savings will provide for us the essentials (food, water, shelter, comfort). Employers expect that they can pay their employees. **A deflationary spiral can change that**. 

Europe is already implementing the unimaginable: negative interest rates. For the longest time, one would read in economics textbooks that interest rates can never fall below 0%. In such a scenario, governments can not control an economy (inflation, GDP growth) because: (1) people are better off storing their money under their beds instead of banks (charged interest) (2) banks are paying borrowers, not the other way around. These are deflationary forces. 

**Where are headed and what we can expect?** 

**Are negative interest rates postponing an inevitable crash?** 

P.S: Thinking back to 2008, investment bankers got away with knowingly screwing over the masses (by selling them garbage mortgage backed securities) and profiting immensely. **Who is going to get away this time?

Recently I've been looking at refinancing my house to a lower rate - I currently pay 3.875, and am hoping rates drop to 2.875 for me.

Its pretty clear to me that being only 2 years into my loan, dropping 100 basis points on my interest rate is a win-win, with a very short breakeven point and very significant savings over the course of the loan.  

What ISN'T clear to me is how MUCH i should borrow.  My house has gone up in value since we bought it with 20% down.  Sample numbers

Original Purchase price 400k

Original Loan - 320k

Remaining Balance - 305k

Current value - 450k

Math and personal finance tells me that if I can expect to make 7-10% in the stock market, and I can borrow money for 2.875%, I should be borrowing the maximum I can and firing it into a index fund for 30 years instead.

MachineLearning,[R] Call for Paper: International Workshop on Federated Learning at IJCAI 2020,"**International Workshop on Federated Learning for User Privacy and Data Confidentiality in Conjunction with IJCAI 2020 (FL-IJCAI'20)** 

**Submission Due**: April 26, 2020 (23:59 UTC-12)   
**Notification Due**: May 24, 2020 (23:59 UTC-12) 

**Workshop Date**: July 13, 2020 (tentative)   
**Venue**: Pacifico Yokohama, Yokohama, Japan   
(with online meeting contingency plan) 

**Call for Papers** 

Privacy and security are becoming a key concern in our digital age.  Companies and organizations are collecting a wealth of data on a daily  basis. Data owners have to be very cautious while exploiting the values  in the data, since the most useful data for machine learning often tend  to be confidential. Increasingly strict data privacy regulations such as  the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) bring  new legislative challenges to the big data and artificial intelligence  (AI) community. Many operations in the big data domain, such as merging  user data from various sources for building an AI model, will be  considered illegal under the new regulatory framework if they are  performed without explicit user authorization. More resources about federated learning can be found [**here**](http://federated-learning.org/).  

In order to explore how the AI research community can adapt to  this new regulatory reality, we organize this one-day workshop in  conjunction with the 29th International Joint Conference on Artificial  Intelligence (IJCAI-20). The workshop will focus on machine learning  systems adhering to the privacy-preserving and security principles.  Technical issues include but not limit to data collection, integration,  training and modelling, both in the centralized and distributed setting.  The workshop intends to provide a forum to discuss the open problems  and share the most recent and ground-breaking work on the study and  application of secure and privacy-preserving compliant machine learning.  Both theoretical and application-based contributions are welcome. The  FL series of workshops seek to explore new ideas with particular focus  on addressing the following challenges: 

* Security and Regulation Compliance: How to meet the security and  compliance requirements? Does the solution ensure data privacy and model  security?
* Collaboration and Expansion Solution: Does the solution connect  different business partners from various parties and industries? Does  the solution exploit and extend the value of data while observing user  privacy and data security?
* Promotion &amp; Empowerment: Is the solution sustainable and  intelligent? Does it include incentive mechanisms to encourage parties  to participate on a continuous basis? Does it promote a stable and  win-win business ecosystem?

We welcome submissions on recent advances in privacy-preserving,  secure machine learning and artificial intelligence systems. All  accepted papers will be presented during the workshop. At least one  author of each accepted paper is expected to represent it at the  workshop. Topics include but not limit to:   

Techniques  

1. Adversarial learning, data poisoning, adversarial examples, adversarial robustness, black box attacks
2. Architecture and privacy-preserving learning protocols
3. Federated learning and distributed privacy-preserving algorithms
4. Human-in-the-loop for privacy-aware machine learning
5. Incentive mechanism and game theory
6. Privacy aware knowledge driven federated learning
7. Privacy-preserving techniques (secure multi-party computation,  homomorphic encryption, secret sharing techniques, differential privacy)  for machine learning
8. Responsible, explainable and interpretability of AI
9. Security for privacy
10. Trade-off between privacy and efficiency

Applications 

1. Approaches to make AI GDPR-compliant
2. Crowd intelligence
3. Data value and economics of data federation
4. Open-source frameworks for distributed learning
5. Safety and security assessment of AI solutions
6. Solutions to data security and small-data challenges in industries
7. Standards of data privacy and security

Position, perspective, and vision papers are also welcome.

stocks,Possible Peter Lynch Like Cyclical Auto Stock?,"A few years have passed since Peter Lynch's last book. Almost 30 to be exact. As you might know, some of his best positions for a number of years were auto stocks.

 Let's discuss Daimler in this post. The company has been hit pretty hard. Daimler wanted to sell 25,000 Mercedes-Benz EQC in 2019, but managed to sell only 7000. The company plans to produce 50,000 of them in 2020... 

By the way, how do you see Renault in the future? Is there something that makes you believe they will make it out in one piece? Renault's stock has fallen from 64 to 23 Euros in a year. I am not going to provide numbers for Renault though, because I haven't looked at its annual reports.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, let's start. Daimler right now has a P/E ratio of 16. Its average P/E for the last 3 years has been 5,25. According to Lynch that is one of the first good signs to look for in a cyclical company - with cyclical companies when P/E goes up it is one of the first indicators it might be a good time to buy(Well,I believe not like Ford whose P/E rose to 200, it is a bit too extreme :D). You can buy Daimler for 35 Euros with a Book Value of 58 Euros. NOTE : its price has recently fallen from 59 to 35 Euros!! Its Price to Book Ratio is 0,60. EPS has fallen to 2,22. The 3 year average EPS for 2016-2018 of Daimler is 8,12. Daimler's long-term debt is around 160 Billion Euros(Ouch, unfortunately pretty typical for almost every auto company with may be some exceptions). Cash on hand : Just 25 Billion Euros. Total Liabilities to Equity Ratio is 3,86. The dividend got cut from 3,25 Euros to 0,90 cents(2,49% yield). I actually believe that would help them right now to be more flexible when they don't have to pay out as much money to their shareholders. Daimler's Gross Margin has been around 20% for the last 7 years with a Net Margin of around 6-7%. Return on Equity has been MOSTLY around 15 and 16% between 2010 and 2018. They are trying to transition to electric vehicles and they have warned that it will be a painful transition.

Would you consider buying Daimler despite its big amount of debt? I believe it could be a potential turnaround, at this point of time I don't own a single share of it. Its debt amount makes me wonder. I understand they have taken it at low interest rates, but it still makes me wonder if banks would ""call"" their loans if a recession comes by and make Daimler pretty much go bankrupt or search for help from the German government... What do you think?",finance
investing,XOM - safer than cash,"Why would investors with medium to long time horizons not load up on XOM at these levels?

P/E of 14 and dividend of 6.94%

Seriously, isn't XOM safer than US dollars considering all the Fed pumping and printing?

Sure, energy demand has slowed due to Coronavirus, but give me a break, didn't impact dividend in 2001 or 2008 - 37 year dividend growth track record:

If you listen to Fauci, he literally says if you think you have Coronavirus, self-quarantine and ""hunker down"".  I understand why companies are coming out and supporting employees with statements like ""work from home"" (mainly for testing capacity), ""we'll pay you"" (MSFT, etc.), but that's largely PR and the hysteria is way overblown.

I mention XOM because of the strong balance sheet and dividend history, however GM at P/E of 6 and dividend of 5%...is that investment also not better than sitting in cash or buying treasuries at 0.6%?",finance

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning March 9th, 2020.

# **Wall Street braces for more market volatility as wild swings become the ‘new normal’ amid coronavirus  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/06/investors-brace-for-more-volatility-as-wild-swings-become-new-normal.html)**
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 has never behaved like this, but Wall Street strategists say get used to it.
*****
&gt; Investors just witnessed the equity benchmark swinging up or down 2% for four days straight in the face of the coronavirus panic.
*****
&gt; In the index’s history dating back to 1927, this is the first time the S&amp;P 500 had a week of alternating gains and losses of more than 2% from Monday through Thursday, according to Bespoke Investment Group. Daily swings like this over a two-week period were only seen at the peak of the financial crisis and in 2011 when U.S. sovereign debt got its first-ever downgrade, the firm said.
*****
&gt; “The message to all investors is that they should expect this volatility to continue. This should be considered the new normal going forward,” said Mike Loewengart, managing director of investment strategy at E-Trade.
*****
&gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped north of 1,000 points twice in the past week, only to erase the quadruple-digit gains in the subsequent sessions. The coronavirus outbreak kept investors on edge as global cases of the infections surpassed 100,000. It’s also spreading rapidly in the U.S. California has declared a state of emergency, while the number of cases in New York reached 33.
*****
&gt; “Uncertainty breeds greater market volatility,” Keith Lerner, SunTrust’s chief market strategist, said in a note. “Much is still unknown about how severe and widespread the coronavirus will become. From a market perspective, what we are seeing is uncomfortable but somewhat typical after shock periods.”
*****
&gt; # More stimulus?
&gt; So far, the actions from global central banks and governments in response to the outbreak haven’t triggered a sustainable rebound.
*****
&gt; The Federal Reserve’s first emergency rate cut since the financial crisis did little to calm investor anxiety. President Donald Trump on Friday signed a sweeping spending bill with an$8.3 billion packageto aid prevention efforts to produce a vaccine for the deadly disease, but stocks extended their heavy rout that day.
*****
&gt; “The market is recognizing the global authorities are responding to this,” said Tom Essaye, founder of the Sevens Report. “If the market begins to worry they are not doing that sufficiently, then I think we are going to go down ugly. It is helping stocks hold up.”
*****
&gt; Essaye said any further stimulus from China and a decent-sized fiscal package from Germany would be positive to the market, but he doesn’t expect the moves to create a huge rebound.
*****
&gt; The fed funds future market is now pricing in the possibility of the U.S. central bank cutting by 75 basis points at its March 17-18 meeting.
*****
&gt; # Where is the bottom?
&gt; Many on Wall Street expect the market to fall further before recovering as the health crisis unfolds.
*****
&gt; Binky Chadha, Deutsche Bank’s chief equity strategist, sees a bottom for the S&amp;P 500 in the second quarter after stocks falling as much as 20% from their recent peak.
*****
&gt; “The magnitude of the selloff in the S&amp;P 500 so far has further to go; and in terms of duration, just two weeks in, it is much too early to declare this episode as being done,” Chadha said in a note. “We do view the impacts on macro and earnings growth as being relatively short-lived and the market eventually looking through them.”
*****
&gt; Deutsche Bank maintained its year-end target of 3,250 for the S&amp;P 500, which would represent a 10% gain from here and a flat return for 2020.
*****
&gt; Strategists are also urging patience during this heightened volatility, cautioning against panic selling.
*****
&gt; “It is during times like these that investors need to maintain a longer-term perspective and stick to their investment process rather than making knee-jerk, binary decisions,” Brian Belski, chief investment strategist at BMO Capital Markets, said in a note.

# A ""Run of the Mill"" Drawdown

&gt; If you're like us, you've heard a lot of people reference the recent equity declines as a sign that the market is pricing in some sort of Armageddon in the US economy. While comments like that make for great soundbites, a little perspective is in order. Since the S&amp;P 500's high on February 19th, the S&amp;P 500 is down 12.8%. In the chart below, we show the S&amp;P 500's annual maximum drawdown by year going back to 1928. In the entire history of the index, the median maximum drawdown from a YTD high is 13.05%. In other words, this year's decline is actually less than normal. Perhaps due to the fact that we have only seen one larger-than-average drawdown in the last eight years is why this one feels so bad.

&gt; The fact that the current decline has only been inline with the historical norm raises a number of questions. For example, if the market has already priced in the worst-case scenario, going out and adding some equity exposure would be a no brainer. However, if we're only in the midst of a 'normal' drawdown in the equity market as the coronavirus outbreak threatens to put the economy into a recession, one could argue that things for the stock market could get worse before they get better, especially when we know that the market can be prone to over-reaction in both directions. The fact is that nobody knows right now how this entire outbreak will play out. If it really is a black swan, the market definitely has further to fall and now would present a great opportunity to sell more equities. However, if it proves to be temporary and after a quarter or two resolves itself and the economy gets back on the path it was on at the start of the year, then the magnitude of the current decline is probably appropriate. As they say, that's what makes a market!

# Long-Term Treasuries Go Haywire

&gt; Take a good luck at today's moves in long-term US Treasury yields, because chances are you won't see moves of this magnitude again soon. Let's start with the yield on the 30-year US Treasury. Today's decline of 29 basis points in the yield will go down as the largest one-day decline in the yield on the 30-year since 2009. For some perspective, there have only been 25 other days since 1977 where the yield saw a larger one day decline.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/030620-Change.png))**

&gt; That doesn't even tell the whole story, though. As shown in the chart below, every other time the yield saw a sharper one-day decline, the actual yield of the 30-year was much higher, and in most other cases it was much, much higher.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/030620-Yield.png))**

&gt; To show this another way, the percentage change in the yield on the 30-year has never been seen before, and it's not even close. Now, before the chart crime police come calling, we realize showing a percentage change of a percentage is not the most accurate representation, but we wanted to show this for illustrative purposes only.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/030620-Percent-change-in-yield.png))**

&gt; Finally, with long-term interest rates plummetting we wanted to provide an update on the performance of the Austrian 100-year bond. That's now back at record highs, begging the question, why is the US not flooding the market with long-term debt?

# It Doesn't Get Much Worse Than This For Crude Oil

&gt; Crude oil prices are down close to 10% today in what is shaping up to be the worst day for crude oil since late 2014. That's more than five years.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/030620-Crude-Oil-Daily-Changes.png))**

&gt; Today's decline is pretty much a continuation of what has been a one-way trade for the commodity ever since the US drone strike on Iranian general Soleimani. The last time prices were this low was around Christmas 2018.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/030620-Crude-Oil.png))**

&gt; With today's decline, crude oil is now off to its worst start to a year in a generation falling 32%. Since 1984, the only other year that was worse was 1986 when the year started out with a decline of 50% through March 6th. If you're looking for a bright spot, in 1986, prices rose 36% over the remainder of the year. The only other year where crude oil kicked off the year with a 30% decline was in 1991 after the first Iraq war. Over the remainder of that year, prices rose a more modest 5%.

# 10-Year Treasury Yield Breaks Below 1%

&gt; Despite strong market gains on Wednesday, March 4, 2020, the on-the-run 10-year Treasury yield ended the day below 1% for the first time ever and has posted additional declines in real time, sitting at 0.92% intraday as this blog is being written. “The decline in yields has been remarkable,” said LPL Research Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “The 10-year Treasury yield has dipped below 1%, and today’s declines are likely to make the recent run lower the largest decline of the cycle.”

&gt; As shown in LPL Research’s chart of the day, the current decline in the 10-year Treasury yield without a meaningful reversal (defined as at least 0.75%) is approaching the decline seen in 2011 and 2012 and would need about another two months to be the longest decline in length of time. At the same time, no prior decline has lasted forever and a pattern of declines and increases has been normal.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Blog-chart-3.5.20.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; What are some things that can push the 10-year Treasury yield lower?

&gt; * A shrinking but still sizable yield advantage over other developed market sovereign debt
&gt; * Added stock volatility if downside risks to economic growth from the coronavirus increase
&gt; * A larger potential premium over shorter-term yields if the Federal Reserve aggressively cuts interest rates

&gt; What are some things that can push the 10-year Treasury yield higher?

&gt; * A second half economic rebound acting a catalyst for a Treasury sell-off
&gt; * As yields move lower, investors may increasingly seek more attractive sources of income
&gt; * Any dollar weakness could lead to some selling by international investors
&gt; * Longer maturity Treasuries are looking like an increasingly crowded trade, potentially adding energy to any sell-off

&gt; On balance, our view remains that the prospect of an economic rebound over the second half points to the potential for interest rates moving higher. At the same time, we still see some advantage in the potential diversification benefits of intermediate maturity high-quality bonds, especially during periods of market stress. We continue to recommend that suitable investors consider keeping a bond portfolio’s sensitivity to changes in interest rates below that of the benchmark Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index by emphasizing short to intermediate maturity bonds, but do not believe it’s time to pile into very short maturities despite the 10-year Treasury yield sitting at historically low levels.

# U.S. Jobs Growth Marches On

&gt; While stock markets continue to be extremely volatile as they come to terms with how the coronavirus may affect global growth, the U.S. job market has remained remarkably robust. Continued U.S. jobs data resilience in the face of headwinds from the coronavirus outbreak may be a key factor in prolonging the expansion, given how important the strength of the U.S. consumer has been late into this expansion.

&gt; The U.S. Department of Labor today reported that U.S. nonfarm payroll data had a strong showing of 273,000 jobs added in February, topping the expectation of every Bloomberg-surveyed economist, with an additional upward revision of 85,000 additional jobs for December 2019 and January 2020. This has brought the current unemployment rate back to its 50-year low of 3.5%. So far, it appears it’s too soon for any effects of the coronavirus to have been felt in the jobs numbers. (Note: The survey takes place in the middle of each month.)

&gt; On Wednesday, ADP released its private payroll data (excluding government jobs), which increased by 183,000 in February, also handily beating market expectations. Most of these jobs were added in the service sector, with 44,000 added in the leisure and hospitality sector, and another 31,000 in trade/transportation/utilities. Both of these areas could be at risk of potential cutbacks if consumers start to avoid eating out or other leisure pursuits due to coronavirus fears.

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, payrolls remain strong, and any effects of the virus outbreaks most likely would be felt in coming months.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/US-Jobs-Data.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; “February’s jobs report shows the 113th straight month that the U.S. jobs market has grown,” said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “That’s an incredible run and highlights how the U.S. consumer has become key to extending the expansion, especially given setbacks to global growth from the coronavirus outbreak.”

&gt; While there is bound to be some drag on future jobs data from the coronavirus-related slowdown, we would anticipate that the effects of this may be transitory. We believe economic fundamentals continue to suggest the possibility of a second-half-of-the–year economic rebound.

# Down January &amp; Down February: S&amp;P 500 Posts Full-Year Gain Just 43.75% of Time

&gt; The combination of a down January and a down February has come about 17 times, including this year, going back to 1950. Rest of the year and full-year performance has taken a rather sizable hit following the previous 16 occurrences. March through December S&amp;P 500 average performance drops to 2.32% compared to 7.69% in all years. Full-year performance is even worse with S&amp;P 500 average turning to a loss of 4.91% compared to an average gain of 9.14% in all years. All hope for 2020 is not lost as seven of the 16 past down January and down February years did go on to log gains over the last 10 months and full year while six enjoyed double-digit gains from March to December.

# Take Caution After Emergency Rate Cut

&gt; Today’s big rally was an encouraging sign that the markets are becoming more comfortable with the public health, monetary and political handling of the situation. But the history of these “emergency” or “surprise” rate cuts by the Fed between meetings suggest some caution remains in order.

&gt; The table here shows that these surprise cuts between meetings have really only “worked” once in the past 20+ years. In 1998 when the Fed and the plunge protection team acted swiftly and in a coordinated manner to stave off the fallout from the financial crisis caused by the collapse of the Russian ruble and the highly leveraged Long Term Capital Management hedge fund markets responded well. This was not the case during the extended bear markets of 2001-2002 and 2007-2009.

&gt; Bottom line: if this is a short-term impact like the 1998 financial crisis the market should recover sooner rather than later. But if the economic impact of coronavirus virus is prolonged, the market is more likely to languish.

personalfinance,2019 filing mistake!,"Not sure if this is the right place, but here it goes...

My daughter (16) worked for the first time this year, and received her first W2.  Being the excited kid she is, she filed her taxes without consulting me, and checked that noone else could claim her as a dependent. Fast forward to yesterday and my federal return was rejected because I had claimed her as well.  

Now I know that she can file a 1040x and amend her return, but how long does that take to process?  And what do I do in the meantime?  I used TurboTax, and I cant efile based on this mishap, but it says that if I still want to claim her I can file by mail.

My first (and uneducated) instinct is to amend her return, wait a few weeks and paper file mine and see what happens.  

Any help would be great!",finance
investing,"The problems isn't the virus, the market already had many problems before and we will see a recession and the end of this Bull Market.","Before you start reading on the main topic, i would like to make an analogy.

The reason World War I started is extensively credited to the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand.

Its assassination is considered the fuse that would light the fire that would culminate in World War I.

Europe had many problems between it's nations before the assassination, things weren't going well diplomatically and there was a huge pressure on aliances systems and so on, it was just waiting to happen and the murder of the archduke just made it possible.

Having that in mind:

The coronavirus was just the fuse that would light the fire to the recession.

Relevant things that were happening before the coronavirus:

1. Corporate profits were already in a recession.
2. Huge piles of corporate debt, we are at the end of a credit cycle, meaning people and corporation will have to spend less to cut back on debt.
3. The P/E ratio of the S&amp;P 500, for example, had valuations comparable to previous markets just before the crash, like 2000 and 2008.
4. The Fed already wasted almost all of it’s ammo, reducing it’s ability to keep the economy going, the stock market has been relying for years on the Fed to keep the party going, now that they realize they are on their own, investors could finally realize every price is pretty much inflated.
5. Even though interest rates are historically low, the inflation rate is low, even with a low unemployment rate. This definitely means there is some core problems with the economy since it is a clear show of how much pressure the Fed, consumers and the producers are putting to stimulate growth but it’s still lackluster and clearly show signs of contraction.
6. Millennials and Generation Z are becoming more important every year for the economy. They are probably the most indebted populations there are, reducing their ability to consume, work and to defend themselves against a recession.
7. Even though we have unemployment at record lows, Americans suffer from low wages, almost no working rights, and low capabilities to consume since household debt is at record highs (can’t stimulate growth in the economy if all the households are using their paychecks is just to stay afloat and live up to the next paycheck, leaving little room to actually consume).

So, you have that in mind, and also a Bull Market that has been going since 2009, for 10 years, when the average is 8.

So, if it wasn’t coronavirus it would be something’s else, but let’s examine it’s economic impact.

1. The virus will cause a huge supply shock because of low volume of commerce since China is basically on quarantine and the world depends on China to many of it’s goods.
2. On the side of the consumers, you can cut rates as much as you want, but a huge household debt won’t disappear out of nowhere in these lackluster wages workers are given, have that in mind, the virus is another incentive to consume even less.
3. These halts on supply on demand can cause huge problems on corporations that today are up to their eyeballs in debt, failing to pay short term debts, causing a huge death spiral.
4. The outbreak is not even a it’s peak and already caused a huge economic impact that will only get worse.
5. You can't compare virus outbreaks to previous outbreaks. Because the variable (the virus itself) is completely different from previus outbreaks. People keep comparing this COVID-19 with the SARS in 2003 and they compare how the market reacts back then and think things are going fine. In 2003 the world was much less dependent on China commerce, the Stock Market was just beginning it's Bull Market that would end in 2008. Today we are on all time highs and very much depend on China for global commerce, this virus is much more capable of infection than SARS were, meaning it's economic impact is far greater than any outbreak there.

So yeah, I don’t see the next month with good eyes.

Also, one last thing to make things clear:

You don’t do a emergency cut of 50 bps on a national interest rates if you think the economy is strong and have good foundations, you do it because shit is going down fast and the gears of the economy are starting to break down even faster and you are trying to keep it going by cutting the rates.

personalfinance,Hastily opened up a credit line in order to pay for a mattress with no idea what I was doing or what any of the terms meant. Should I cancel/take a hit to my credit score or pay it off?,"My SO and I are moving into a new place and were (maybe still are) in the market for a new mattress. While at the mall, we visited a well known brand mattress store. We had a previously schedule commitment, so I wanted to leave and cracked when the rep mentioned ""This a special leap day sale - you won't be able to take advantage of it later,"" and had promptly agreed to ""take care of the finances"" when he asked. I had no idea what I was doing, just knowing that I was ""saving money"" and during the entire process of the rep asking me for info, I at the very least asking ""I'm not paying for anything, right? I haven't given you my credit card info or anything,"" and ""There's absolutely no penalty to cancel this, right?"" to which he replied yes. In my mind I thought it was fine, but then after he finished entering, he said ""congratulations on your new mattress, and have a good rest of your day."" It was at this point I realized I had entered into something I was not sure about and now I feel like an idiot. Later, I was told that if you open a credit line to finance things, you can cancel it but will suffer a blow to your credit score. And then I was told that I should just pay for a mattress all at once because a credit line/paying in installments will just screw me over with interest rates. I clearly knew none of this when hastily giving the rep my info.

Here's the deal though:

- We actually like the mattress (and delivery/setup service) that we ""bought"".

- **I am not in a bad place financially at all and can most certainly pay the full amount including whatever interest they may charge.**

- I am financially able to pay the amount in full and all at once, but I've apparently entered in a credit line to pay it off in installments

- This may be a bigger question altogether, but I still do not know what the terms are other than the vague ideas that I have ""taken advantage of a sale"" and am probably(???) saving money. I don't know what ""APR"" is, what opening a credit line entailed, or most of the numbers thrown at me while talking with the sales rep other than the total sum

- As far as I'm aware, my credit score has always been pretty good. I can't think of anything super egregious that may have affected it

Given all that, should I familiarize myself with the actual terms and agreements that I've made to pay off this mattress and just go through with it? Or should I bite the bullet, cancel/take a hit to my credit, and lick my wounds/actually be diligent in understanding what I'm entering? Currently I've not paid for anything nor given anyone payment information, but I feel like this thing will be breathing down my neck, and even though I can pay it off very comfortably, I would admittedly like to just pay for a mattress with one payment.",finance

financialindependence,Five Year Update,"Welp...this would have looked a ***lot*** better if I had done this a couple weeks ago.  But c'est la vie.

I've been posting my family's net worth updates annually for many years (see [2015](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/308xtv/on_track_to_re_by_50/), [2016](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/4a6oww/one_year_update/), [2017](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/5ynkqi/two_year_update/), [2018](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/838e92/three_year_update/), and [2019](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/b44qvp/four_year_update/) updates); I find sharing my plans and progress to be helpful for giving myself a heading check, and hope this community finds my inputs to be helpful.

**Current ages: 34 and 33**. We have two kids and are now (finally!) seeing a slow wind-down in childcare costs as they start to reach school age.  It's still a hefty bill, but we've always managed to keep it reasonable through dependent care FSAs and credit card churning.  

**Combined pre-tax income**: About $196k (\~5.9% increase). In my very first post back in 2015, I mentioned that we had a goal of reaching $200k income by 2020.  And here we are!  My wife gets her raises later in the year, which will officially push us over the top.  For reference, we don't live in a major metro, and things are in the low to medium cost of living range.  So this is big money for us.

**Assets:**

Cash/emergency fund: \~$44k (10% increase). We're doing some work on the house, so building up cash reserves.  More in a bit on that.

Tax advantaged Retirement/HSA accounts: \~$484k (12% increase). This was looking awesome until the recent COVID-19 panic a couple weeks ago.  Then it went down $50k.  Oh well.  We're now maxing out my TSP, my wife's 401k, both Roth IRAs, and about $4,100 towards an HSA.  Almost out of tax shelters.

529 accounts: \~$36k (12% increase). We're contributing about $3k/year for each of our children - our plan is to cover \~75% of the total cost of a public university in our state, including housing and food. A change here is that we converted a portion of these over to our state's prepaid tuition plan.  Our state has a good one at a reasonable cost that will give you full value if they end up going out-of-state; I recommend you read your state plan's details very carefully before you do this though, because most prepaid tuition plans suck.

Taxable investments: \~$9k (25% decrease). In a bit of good news, we coincidentally sold some of our index funds here about a month ago, not in an attempt to time the market, but just to pay for some home repairs/upgrades.  As we run out of tax shelters, most future raises are going to go here, so this account should start seeing big growth later this year.

Vehicles: $31.6k KBB value of three cars (13% decrease). Same cars as last year, just depreciation.  The Chevy Volt's amazing, by the way.  We just put gas in it yesterday for the first time this year.  It's March.

Home: Using Federal Reserve MSA home index, our home value is now \~$577k (10.5% increase), using Zillow estimate is currently $653k (11.6% increase).  This feels high to me, but our local market has seen great gains over the last year.  Our house is over 20 years old and has some basic things that need fixing - old furnace, old water heaters, double paned windows that are failing, etc.  Additionally, we're going to replace the roof and install solar.  To pay for these repairs/upgrades, we're using a combination of cash and are in the middle of a cash out refinance, because holy shit have y'all seen interest rates lately?

**Debts:**

Mortgage: $272k at 3.125% (3% decrease). I never thought I would see lower interest rates than what we got in 2012.  But we just locked in a 2.875% 30 year rate through our credit union which should close in the next month or so.  This is so absurdly low for long-term debt that we would never even consider paying it off early.

Home Equity Loan: $44k at 4.75% (7% decrease). This will be rolled into our refinanced mortgage, so should disappear soon, and will significantly increase our cash flow.

Car Loan: $20k at 3.1% (17% decrease). For the Chevy Volt.

**Net Worth Estimate:** $846k using MSA Home Index (\~17% increase), $922k using Zillow (\~18% increase).  We were *really damn close* to hitting seven figures a couple weeks ago, which I'm a little salty about.  But maybe we'll still hit it by later this year.

**Current plans going forward:** Between our retirement accounts (including matches), 529s, and HSA, we're up to like $70k a year towards tax advantaged savings.  Soon we'll be able to max out the HSA, then we can start working on building a tier of taxable investments.  Our goal is to be able to FIRE if we want to by \~2030 with \~$100k income.  Feels like we're [pretty on track](https://imgur.com/szNZgiU).

So there we go for 2020.  See y'all again next year.",finance
personalfinance,Use Heloc funds to pay off same heloc at higher interest rate?,[deleted],finance
investing,Macro Questions considering FED activity,"Hey All! So it appears to me that we're in a debt fueled bubble very similar to 2007/8. It's possible a big part of this bubble is that we never properly deleveraged in the first place (wrote down bad or under-performing loans), and instead printed money via QE to re-inflate asset prices in order to make the underlying investments of many banks appear stable when they were not. This supposedly temporary and emergency ""fix"" became the permanent state of the FED's balance sheets when their attempt to unwind caused a substantial downturn in stock prices in 2019. 

We could call this the permanent pump. A situation where either any attempt to lay off the gas by the central banks or a global hiccup (beer virus, could've been a war, could've been a terror event, or drought ) leads to immense deflationary pressures. 

So the stock market and it's continued rise may be seen as the primary way we've come to grade economic success or failure. The problem as I understand it with this state is that stock market success doesn't closely align with the overall success of the people at large. So we have a situation where though 50% of the general population is living paycheck to paycheck or worse slipping further and further into debt, the narrative of the media and what I generally see here is just how fantastic everything is (record low unemployment! record stock prices! rising home costs! etc). 

The most credible argument I've seen is that we've had a sustained demand crisis at the center of our economic life for 40 years or more. And that the policy effected by the government has been almost wholly supply side focused. This has led to further and further imbalances and instability within the system as the only way to increase demand these last 40 years has been via loaning money to people who have little (student loans, mortgages, credit cards, auto loans, etc). This has propped up consumer spending to keep it at the levels that the system requires to continue growing, but only by causing considerable pain (via foreclosure, bankruptcy, financial distress) to the everyday people.  

So if you've read this far thank you! 

Is this argument sound? If you disagree, please provide some resources to study why. If you agree please elaborate as I consider myself somewhat ignorant on these topics. 

If the argument is sound, the actions of the FED appear to me to be increasing the  instability of the overall system to continue inflating asset prices that are based on debts that should in reality be written down. The only way to make those debts sustainable is to decrease the interest paid to maintain them. I understand that debt on a national scale will never revert to zero barring a jubilee, however inflating the debt bubble with no punishment for poor investments seems to be creating perverse incentives where nearly any loan for any purpose can and should be given out with no regard to the return on that investment social, financial, or whatever other critical measure one would choose to apply. I know the old truism that markets can stay irrational longer than I can stay solvent, but at what point is the entire financial edifice threatened? Is there a true safe haven: or rather can the central banks maintain confidence in their debased currencies? 

The historical comparisons I draw to current events are both the sustained Roman debasement of their currency during the imperial period and the attempt by the French to create the first fiat currency in the 1700s. Both cases involved systems attempting to ride a wave that never crashes to disastrous effect.  In the Roman case to a centuries of systemic unraveling leading to the ""dark age,"" and in the French case to the quick abandonment of the fiat system and the return to the gold standard. I've never seen the gold standard as effective, but that view was dependent on the masters of the fiat system acting responsibly. 

Anyway, thank you in advance for any insight!",finance

personalfinance,Need opinions/advice for Big Decisions,"Hi Everyone!

In need of some opinions on how our next steps should be played out in goal to financial independence. Here is the summarized version:

We are about to hit our first milestone at the mid to end of June to go travel the world for about 1-2 years and also try our hand at making a blog/youtube channel as a business. All the gear is set for the trip. We are also quitting our full time jobs to do this but will be keeping the income from our rental properties and we’ve set aside a decent chunk of savings to put away in case of an emergency/to invest. I’m 34 and my wife is 30. When we are done travelling we would like to start having children.

**Income Stats starting end of June before trip:**

\-Savings: $120-140k (Currently in a savings account)

\-Wife has about 40k in retirement savings thinking we should move that to a vanguard index fund.

\-Rental Property Income: $5k-6k a month. (After all expenses. Fluctuates depending on what comes up)

\-Wife can do client calls for about $100/hour possibly, but debating since we would like to focus mainly on travel and trying our hand at an online business.

**Debt Stats:**

Student loans: $570 a month (Roughly $95k between both of us. Interest Rates around 4-5%

Mortgages of a duplex and 8 SFHs (Around $550k total. We’re in Michigan so easy to find cash flowing rentals that we manage ourselves and have almost on autopilot, but family helps)

**Questions:**

\-Should we pay off our student loans or leave them on auto pay? Pay down just some of it so more of the payments go to interest? Example: Pay half of both. Does that speed it up a ton?

\-Same question for some of the mortgages. Paying off all mortgages in the future will increase our monthly cashflow to about $10k a month. Not sure if we should just let tenants pay them off over 30 years

\-Should we just invest like $100k into a vanguard index and forget about it for now? I don’t think we’ll need to tap into that for at least a year, more likely more to just let it grow. Anywhere else to invest? Savings accounts aren’t offering much online anymore.

\-If we start seeing money from our new business by end of year….should we throw it at debt or keep investing? Our future goal is to have a nice lifestyle. We’ve worked really hard for this and are excited/scared since we are leaving our jobs for now but also cutting our income down by a lot, lol.

Thanks for your time and excited to be a part of this forum.

personalfinance,Can rental property mortgages be consolidated at lower interest?,"Hi!

My wife and I have a mortgage on our primary residence and mortgages on three rental properties. Each mortgage is serviced by a different company.

We'd like to see if there is a way to refinance everything into an interest rate low enough to let us focus on stock market investments instead of paying off our debt early. Our logic is that if we can reduce everything to 3% interest then we're better off investing in the market (long term \~6% gain) instead of paying off debt (3% loss).

1. Primary residence: $172k owed at 3.375% (house worth \~275k)
2. Rental #1: $50k owed at 4.75% (house worth \~110k)
3. Rental #2: $83k owed at 4.625% (house worth \~110k)
4. Rental #3: $20k owed at 5.625% (house worth \~110k)

I see comments on reddit implying that these are high interest rates compared to today's market. Our credit is strong and our incomes have increased since we secured these loans a few years ago. 

1. Are there banks/credit unions that would consolidate all 4 mortgages into one?
2. Is it realistic to expect a lower average interest rate given today's market (assuming we have strong credit and high income-to-debt ratio)?
3. Are there other considerations that we should be making? Any other gotchas?

personalfinance,Does Mortgage Refinancing Make Sense in this Case?,"My current mortgage was initiated in November 2013 for $200,000 with a 4.5% interest rate.  I currently have an outstanding principal of \~$177k.

I recently started exploring refinance options to take advantage of a lower interest rate.  I was presented with the following from my current lender:

* Option 1 
   * 20 Years
   * 3.375%
   * Monthly payment is roughly the same (increase of \~$13 per month)
* Option 2 
   * 15 Years
   * 2.75%
   * \~$200 increase in monthly payment
* Option 3
   * 30 Years

   * \~$200 decrease in monthly payment
* All loans have the same closing cost of $3,229

I'm leaning toward the Option A to keep the the monthly payment the same.  My only hesitation is that there isn't really a break even point to recoup the closing costs.  Perhaps I'm not thinking about this correctly? 

Which option would be best in this circumstance?

Also, is there typically any room for negotiation for rates and/or closing costs?  The options above were just an initial proposal

My questions:

1. Is it even possible to get a mortgage with such a meager down payment?

2. If so, will the benefits of the lower interest rate be enough to outweigh the cost of private mortgage insurance? Does mortgage insurance eventually go away or does it persist for the life of the mortgage?

investing,The coronavirus is vastly under appreciated,"I believe this is the largest black swan event anyone alive has seen. It will have dramatic health and market/financial consequences that are vastly undervalued. Below is my rationale for that thesis. 

1. In 2009 H1N1 infected 1/5 of the world population (crazy, right?) due to its airborne transmission characteristic but ended up having a very low mortality rate of 0.02% as humanity’s general influenza antibodies proved very effective. 

2. COVID19 spreads more effectively than H1N1 through airborne transmission (this is a disputed fact/assumption; https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/coronavirus/coronavirus-disease-2019-vs-the-flu) and 2x incubation period. Unlike H1N1 influenza, people have no have antibody defense for this strain of coronavirus - hence the novel nomenclature. The purported 1-4% death rate would be the most deadly virus to spread in the last 100 years and tens of millions of people could die. 

3. The virus is insidiously effective because it A) Does not cause large complications/illness in most people so they go about their life and spread continues; B) in the portion of the population it does seriously affect - it is serious serious, with numbers indicating 10ish% of infections require hospitalization and ventilator support. There is no healthcare system on the planet that can accommodate this, the system will get overwhelmed. 

4. The social distancing protocol that China put in place is almost unfathomable. 1.5 billion people have largely not left their apartment in 6 weeks other than to buy food periodically. This is why new numbers are declining but based on 1 and 2 this is just temporary and the virus will inevitably spread again. The virus is incapable of being “contained”. Extreme social distancing a la China might buy time until the 12 month lead time for a vaccine arrives but this would decimate economies. 

5. China style social distancing is impossible outside of China and smaller dictatorships but governments will impose and people will begin self imposing smaller versions. Expect to see March Madness, Coachella, etc all canceled and any business that is able move to work from home. 

6. The economy at the end of the day is driven by end consumer consumption of goods and services, often provided by small mom and pop businesses. Those speaking of a v shaped recovery are non sensical. A drastic month to multi-month drop in cash flow will tip over many of businesses and they will not meet obligations such as payroll. Your neighborhood burger joint can’t fall back on its strong balance sheet and wait for the V/U.

7. 6 will lead to recession and a domino effect through the economy. Where 08 was a top down driven recession this one will be bottom up. It being bottoms up also means it more resistant to the few monetary policy tools we have come accustomed to using. There will be a complete shakeout in the economy as we psychologically grapple with what this virus is going to mean and what things will look like when it is over. Once people start to understand that people they know will die things will get even more panicky. 

8. The world will recover and economies bounce back but we are in for a ride that has largely only been text book theoretical before this. Buckle up.",finance

I am waiting for some info from a certain bank to find out if are there any loan origination/up front fees, end of loan fees, early payoff fees, or a variable rate.

Just to preface this, I am Canadian so these values are measured in loonies and toonies instead of freedom bucks. 

I'm in my early 20's and have been saving up for a used car these last few months. I work full-time, still live at home and i am already spending \~$500 a month commuting through Uber. Bus routes are not an option as I am rural. After carefully budgeting and shopping for insurance, my expenses for a car are \~$500 a month as well.

I have good credit and no outstanding debts other than $4000 left on my student loan, which I am paying off at $100 a month and 3.7% interest. I clear $2300 a month, my current expenses (including Uber) are \~$1000 a month. All in all, $1300/month of discretionary income on top of the $6500 I have already saved.

So, with that information in mind, what is the best course of action for my money? I am quite desperate for a car because due to my rural location, buses aren't an option, I have little freedom outside of work and Uber gets extremely expensive.  Should I consider financing a car in the $10000 range if I can make a large down payment and get a good interest rate? Should I pay off my student loan immediately and use the remainder to buy a used beater? Should I only be looking at used cars under $6500? Am I completely misguided for considering any of these options?

I found this great calculator: https://www.daveramsey.com/mortgage-payoff-calculator, which give me some estimate, but I'm not sure how close it is to the actual number because the calculator expects the extra principal parameter to be either one time, or the same amount per set interval (annually, quarterly, or monthly). I tried set the one time extra principal (calculated by subtracting what I am owing now versus the original amortization) , but it does not allow me to set periodic interval for the future payments as I am planning to do.

Bitcoin,Proof of Drinks: An Open-Source Bitcoin Drinking Game,"*I’ve developed a new game that is played P2P…*

**Proof of Drinks: An Open-Source Bitcoin Drinking Game**

GAME RULES

Player Types:

+ The Market

	1. Includes Drinkers, Buyers, and Sellers
	2. Anyone within The Market may play any of the aforementioned roles at any time.
	3. Manages BITCOIN PROTOCOL
		- Block Reward (frequency, amount, halving)
		- Die Rolls
		- Drink Pour

+ The Bartender

	1. Acts autonomously; is not included within The Market.
	2. Sells glasses and drinks to Drinkers.
	3. Manages PRICE LIST OF GOODS
		- Glasses (fiat/glass)
		- Drinks (fiat/oz.)

+ The Government

	1. Acts autonomously; is not included within The Market.
	2. Manages MONETARY POLICY
		- Inflation Rate
		- Circulating Supply of Fiat

Items needed:

1. Copies of GAME RULES, BITCOIN PROTOCOL, PRICE LIST OF GOODS, and MONETARY POLICY.
2. One six-sided die.
3. A number of six-ounce measuring glasses equal to the number of players within The Market.
4. Drinks (alcoholic or otherwise).
5. Fiat money (or Monopoly money).
6. Minimum 6 players or so.

Object of the Game:

1. To learn the mechanics of bitcoin and the economy through drinking and having fun.
2. The game ends when one or more of the following conditions are met:
	- You run out of drinks.
	- Everyone is tired of drinking.
	- Everyone is tired of playing.
3. At the end of the game, the person with the highest net worth (fiat + bitcoin) is deemed The Winner.

General Rules and Definitions:

1. All die rolls are performed in front of all participants.
2. Bathroom breaks are permitted, however gameplay continues. If a Drinker is in the bathroom during their round, their round is forfeited.
3. Anyone within The Market may buy and sell anything at anytime.
4. Round: The procedure for drinking; may or may not result in the production of bitcoin.
5. Block: A round that results in the production of bitcoin.
6. Anyone within The Market can propose a change to any rule at any time.
	- If everyone agrees, game play continues with the new rule.
	- If no one agrees, the person who proposed the change may continue playing or quit the game.
	- If some, but not all, agree, then the game may be forked into two separate games (Note: this may cause hurt feelings). The Government and The Bartender tend to both games.
7. All values (bitcoin, block reward, fiat, etc) are to be rounded to the nearest whole number.

Analogies:

1. Drinkers = Miners
2. Glasses = Mining equipment
3. Drinking = Proof of Work
4. Die roll after drinking = Mining for the nonce
5. Drink pour = Difficulty
6. Bathroom break = Mining equipment maintenance
7. All drinks and die rolls observed by everyone = Nodes validating

Game Setup:

1. Designate a minimum of one player to be The Government.
2. Designate a minimum of one player to be The Bartender.
3. All other players (minimum 2? 3? 4?) are collectively The Market.
4. The Government gives The Bartender and everyone within The Market ___ dollars each.
5. For the first round, everyone within The Market is a Drinker (in subsequent rounds, anyone can step in our step out of the Drinker role).
6. All Drinkers claim a chair around a table.
7. All Drinkers purchase a glass from The Bartender at ___ dollars per glass. (Use a 6 oz. measuring glass for ease of pour.)
8. All Drinkers roll a die; the Drinker with the highest number goes first. Subsequent rounds proceed clockwise.
9. The Bartender determines the initial Cost of Drinking (fiat/drink).
10. Determine the beginning Block Reward (50?).

Round Procedure:

1. Determine the Nonce
	- Someone in The Market rolls a die. The number rolled is the Nonce for the Block.
2. Determine the Pour
	- Someone, other than the Drinker for this round, rolls a die. The number rolled equals the amount of drink poured (e.g., a roll of “3” means 3 ounces is poured into the Drinker’s glass).
3. The Drinker drinks the pour, then, once The Market has collectively determined the glass is free of liquid, the Drinker rolls a die. All participants in The Market verify the die roll.
	- If the die matches the Nonce, the Drinker receives the Block Reward! It is now the next Drinker’s turn, beginning again with Step 1 above.
	- If the die does not match the Nonce, no Block Reward is granted. It is now the next Drinker’s turn, beginning with Step 2 above.
4. Every 10 Blocks, the Block Reward is cut in half.
5. Once all Drinkers have completed a Round, The Government determines a new Inflation Rate and inflates the Circulating Supply of Fiat accordingly.
	- The Government rolls a die in another room then comes out and announces the result of the die roll. The number of the result is the inflation rate (e.g., if the roll is “3” the inflation rate is 3%).
	- The Government multiplies the Circulating Supply of Fiat by the Inflation Rate and adds this amount to the Circulating Supply of Fiat. The Government can do anything it wants with the fiat created.
6. The value of each bitcoin (fiat/bitcoin) is determined by members of The Market.
	- For the determination of the Winner at the end of the game, the final value of bitcoin is the last value at which it traded.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,"There are 3 paths you can go by, but In the long run...","We had a secured line of credit to lift our house and put a basement underneath. We switched it to a mortgage because rates were going up 2 years ago, and mortgage rates were lower than our line of credit rate. So now we have 2 mortgages on the same house. Our first mortgage is renewing this month, it has $133,883 left on it. We got a renewal rate of 2.79% for 5 years. Our second mortgage isn't up for renewal for 3 years and it is at $157,635  but right now we are paying 3.49% on it. If we pay a penalty of $2,643.92 we can renew it as well, and get the 2.79% interest rate. As an alternative our bank has also offered us a 3.20% interest rate for the second mortgage as a blend and extend option so we don't have to pay the penalty. The blend and extend will extend it for the next 2 years so they both renew at the same time. We are planning to pay accelerated weekly payments in order to pay as little interest as possible on both of them. Our amortization on #1 is 18 years and #2 is 22 years. So we have 3 options:

•Option 1: Renew # 1 @ 2.79% pay penalty and also renew #2 and have them both expire in 5 years

•Option 2: Renew# 1 @ 2.79% pay NO penalty and renew #2 @ 3.20% and have them both expire in 5 years

•Option 3: Renew# 1 @ 2.79% leave # 2 @ 3.49 which will expire in 3 years and who knows what the interest rate will be then.

I used a mortgage calculator and my horrible math skills to come up with how much total interest we will pay over the next 5 years...which is our main concern. We really want to pay the bank as little as possible in interest.

Option 1: $39,241.49 interest

Option 2: $45,824.27 interest

Option 3: $31,704 interest for 5 years on #1 and for the first 3 years on #2. Depending on where mortgage rates go after 3 years I did a calculation for 3.5% 5 year total =$54,453.06 or best case scenario if they went down to 2.5% 5 year total= $38,393.31

So I'm in over $60,000 in debt and have been getting some mail about refinancing my loans.

I've got 3 private student loans - I was never able to get federal loans as I'm a DACA recipient.

All three loans have fixed interest rates of approximately 10-12%

The mail I've gotten doesn't actually explain what it means to refinance these loans. It also states that I could *possibly* end up with 2% APR

Does refinancing mean that this company will pay off my loan and in turn, I will owe them instead of my the bank that issued my loans?

I've been in the process of finding full time work in my field - which has been really hard as I've had interviews but no work. I have been working part time in order to afford the time to go to interviews and apply to places, but this also means my low income has hindered me from even properly paying back loans.

The other option is to move. I don't know where I could move where I could make more money and still be in an office environment, but not have a crazy cost of living.

personalfinance,Refinance - 15 Year Mortgage or 30 Year W/ Extra Payments?,"Hi everyone,

With the mortgage interests rates at an all time low, I am considering refinancing. My goal is total savings and paying off my house faster. Lowering the monthly payment is not as important.

I have a $120,000 mortgage that started in 2010 with a 4.625% interest rate. I currently owe $86,000 on this mortgage and have **20 years left on this mortgage**. The principal and interest is $555 monthly. I plan on staying at this house for 20+ years. Great location, young children, nearby family, good job opportunities, etc.

**Refinance 15 Year Fixed Term Option**

I am considering refinancing to a 15 year mortgage and I can get a 2.5% interest rate. That makes principal and interest payment at $613. Closing costs are $1650. I can easily afford an extra $58 per month in my budget. I already have 6 month emergency fund, max Roth IRA contribution,  no debt other than mortgage, etc. The extra payment will not stress my budget. The 15 year refinance means I would basically pay off my house 5 years faster than if I did not refinance at all. I would also save ~$16,000 after 10 years compared to not refinancing, according to [this calculator](https://www.nerdwallet.com/mortgages/refinance-calculator).

**Refinance 30 Year Fixed Term Option**

My loan officer also provided a loan estimate for a 30 year fixed term at a 2.85% interest rate. That's a $381 principal and interest payment. Closing costs are $2,100. Initially this did not make sense, because I do not want to extend my mortgage another extra ten years by taking a new 30 year fixed term. However, I confirmed that I could make extra payments without penalty. So, with this lower interest rate, I could pay an extra 200 dollars per month, making my total monthly principal and interest would be $581 and it would be paid off in ~16 years. That's only about $30 more than my current P&amp;I payment.

For the goals of total savings and paying mortgage faster, **does it make sense to refinance to a 15 year fixed term or refinance to a 30 year fixed term and make extra payments?**

My wife and I are in our late 20s (no children yet), have staple jobs in the SF Bay Area. Our annual is around 280K (salary) + 20K (passive rental income), no debt besides two mortgages and a car loan. We have two houses both with positive equity (\~500K). With the current rate cut, we want to do a refinance for both houses (the current interest rate for both houses is around 4% and we could probably lower the interest rate to 3.5% minimum with no cash out). Since the rate is so low, we plan to go with the cash-out plan and tap into 20%-25% of our equity. Some of our friends suggest we should spend that money right away to purchase another house so we could rent out our current house to further increase our passive income. We do somewhat agree with our friends but we think there is more room for the housing market in the Bay Area to take another small dip. So our real question here, what type of investment we should do with the money? Currently, we are thinking pay off our car (\~40K left for the car loan), spending 20K in house improvement,  and save the rest into Betterment and wait for the right time to purchase a new house.

solar,LG 375W panels with integrated microinverter,"We’re building a house this year. We’re going 100% electric with heating/cooling and appliances, and we will be installing solar. The solar array will be west-facing (this roof plane is approximately 23ft x 42ft).

My first instinct, as a Tesla Model 3 owner, was to go with the Tesla “Large” system (36 Hanwha panels). The $/W for this system after federal/state rebates comes to $1.40/W. Pretty good. However, I’m concerned about using a standard “central” inverter with a warranty of only 10 years, and generally just concerned about Tesla’s installation quality. This is a company that doesn’t exactly take pride in their workmanship or customer service.

After researching more, and as a pretty handy and well researched individual, I’m thinking I can DIY a system and pay a contractor to install it. I think there’s a lot of benefits to a microinverter system, and I came across LG’s NeON R ACe modules... 375W per panel with an integrated microinverter, and everything warrantied for 25 years. Plus, I can do a 30 panel array generate essentially the same power as a 36 panel Tesla array.

personalfinance,Need help to identify correct Tax Software for my case,"I'm a grad student (non-resident alien) on F-1 visa and have worked in two states (MN/TX) in 2019. The total aggregate income is less than 69,000. One of the two states doesn't need me to file state taxes (Texas). 

I'm a non-resident as per Minnesota's state tax criterion and it states that I don't have to file for state taxes if my income while in Minnesota is less than $12,000. This applies to me. 

I lived in Texas for more than 183 days and it doesn't require a state tax. I'm filing my taxes from MN.

I'm fairly new to the tax process and I needed some help with my queries:

1. Am I allowed to be a non-resident of MN if I'm filing my Federal taxes from MN? In general, can I be considered to be a non-resident of two states and not a resident of any state for a calendar year? If yes, do we file non-resident taxes for both the states?

2. Since neither state needs me to file state taxes, can I just use any free software from the IRS website which would let me just file Federal Taxes for free? I had some money withheld while in Minneapolis (about 80 cents) which I don't want to claim for a refund. Will it be okay if I don't file state taxes to get that refund? Alternatively, can I file for MN even though the website says I don't need to because it's free? Will it negatively impact me later?

3. Does e-filing process require documents from previous years? Will it be a problem in the future if I don't have any state tax documents but federal tax documents?

4. As part of my job in Texas, I got a HSA account account in which I deposited 7 cents in monthly installments of 1 cent each and my employer credited a total of 300 dollars in 2019. I am aware I will need to file form 8889. As per the form, the HSA deduction ended up being 7 cents. I was told to round up all figures to the dollar amounts on my tax returns. Can I just skip entering the HSA deduction in 1040-NR and attach Form 8889?

5. Do I have to show interest earned on checking accounts as part of the tax filings? I didn't get any W-2 form from my bank and I'm unsure about the process to figure out if I did earn any meaningful interest from it. 

6. If I have a trading account and I didn't have any activity in 2019 at all in the trading account but I own some stocks from 2018 and before, do I need to still need to file taxes? As far as I'm aware, I would need to file taxes if on aggregate at the end of the year I either see a profit (capital gains) or a net loss I want to claim a reduction in gross income for. Am I correct?

7. Does cashback count as income earned?

Banking,Negotiating monthly account fees with Chase,"Two Things First:

1) I am looking to leave my current bank and start a new account with a bank that offers better services to customers and or checking/savings account interest rates

2) I am interested in signing up for a rewards credit card - I am most interested in the Chase Sapphire Reserve

I want to try to keep all of my accounts in the same place and I am tired of having an account with a 0.01%apy. Many banks offer 1.7%+ now. Chase does not. The Chase Sapphire Checking Account waives a lot of ATM fees, offers a safety deposit box with no annual fee, 24/7 customer service and a lot of other added benefits. Their site says the will only waive the $25/month fee if you have a daily average balance of USD$75,000 which I will not be able to meet.

The Chase Sapphire Reserve has a $550/year fee.

Has anyone ever had any luck waiving this $25/month fee by opening up a premium credit card, or by opening an IRA investment account or other means? I have a decent amount of money to start an account with and I could take it to a bank that does offer a higher apy. The $25/month fee just seems like it’s not that big of a deal. Even their lower tier accounts have $12, and $25 monthly fees without offering the same customer benefits. And $75,000 daily average seems kind of steep. 

The only two checking accounts that even earn interest both have a $25/month fee. The waiver requirement is $15,000 and $75,000 respectively. Their savings accounts only have a 0.01% interest rate unless you have one of the accounts with a $25/month fee and then it’s only 0.04% apy interest. So I’m trying to figure out where the customers benefit of opening an account with them lies. 

I’ve read some stories about people who when they approached their banks with a kind and respectful attitude that they sometimes will waive monthly fees. Has anyone had success? Other ideas about how to leverage myself as a customer?",finance

Potential costs based on option (if you have other suggestions please let me know, these are just the immediate ones we thought of):

1. Rent a 2bd/1ba place for mom and pay her expenses. I would have to cover her rent (min. $1200/mo + utilities + whatever I can cover in food and bills, total assumed to be about 2k max).
2. Buy a small 3 bedroom place for mom and charge my brother $2-400 rent (19, in college, reliable) to help cover expenses. Home would be around $120-170k, monthly payment around $1200 (PITI). Still pay our own rent. Biggest fear here is that any of my other siblings try to crash here for free (some of them are deadbeats who never paid their own rent, one is an alcoholic, etc).
3. Buy a larger home (4-5 bedrooms, 300-370k, room for our office and space to be able to breathe with so many people in 1 house) and have them live for us for at least the next 5 years while we get out of student loan/auto debt and plan for our financial future. No risk of siblings crashing with us, they wouldn't dare try me. We still have 8 months left on our lease and I haven't yet explored avenues for breaking it if needed (or if we should just wait until August to buy).

**Credit Scores:**  \~750 me, \~780 spouse - if buying we'd do conventional 5% down, can't wait for 20% down, don't mind paying PMI since we can rapidly pay off mortgage once debt is gone.

My mind is a big cloud right now. I have been weighing all options with my spouse and we're just so afraid of making the wrong decision and sinking our future. Our income only got this high in the last 2 yrs which is why we're rapidly trying to pay off debt. My mom is a refugee, no high school diploma, english is her 2nd language and she tries really hard. Her first job ever she got last September in retail on her own and she's so happy to finally be allowed to work and make her own money. She nets about $2-300/month on average. I don't expect her earning potential to go up due to her age and medical issues (fibromyalgia and a heart condition) - I don't expect my dad to provide any financial support even if ordered by the courts (he grosses about 30k/yr and doesn't work stable jobs).

I'm fortunate that my spouse and I are on the same page in that we know we must help them and we love my mom. We're proud of her for surviving this long and finally making it out. Please let me know if I can elaborate on anything. My mom+sister have been staying with us for a month so far and we are thankful they are safe and happy. I appreciate any advice you can offer.

I owe federal and I'm getting a state refund.

When I download my return I get some payment vouchers and my federal and state forms.

Here's something I found odd.  I get four payment vouchers for $524 each (with different due dates), so a total of **$2,096**. I also have a separate payment voucher for **$2,106**, which is **$10 more** than the sum of the four payment vouchers. $2,106 is what Turbo Tax says I owe. 

My first question is why is it more expensive to make a full payment at once? It seems like they'd give a discount for that. My property taxes have the same payment options but they give you a discount if you pay it all upfront.

My second, and really the main question is, what do I need to mail in to the IRS?  I'm assuming I just need to mail the payment voucher with a check because the whole point of efiling is to not have to physically mail copies of my return, but rather get them to the fed/state immediately.",finance

My wife and I both elected for our employers to contribute to a flexible spending account for child care.  The idea is that the employer basically helps us to pay for day care pretax, as a benefit.  Great.  However, there's a federal limit on this benefit of $5000 for the household, and we contributed $9300 collectively, $5000 for me, and $4300 for her.  (Oops.)

Surely there must be some rich, powerful people out there who are fed up with this bullshit and forming a lawsuit in conjunction with the SEC to have BitMex and its nonsense stopped once and for all.

personalfinance,"Refinance mortgage, student loans, or both?","So my husband and I closed on a mortgage not that long ago, like a few months, and we were told that we would be eligible to refinance already at .75 less than where we're at. Fees wouldn't be terrible as it would be through our current lender. 

Thing is - I was thinking of refinancing my student loans instead. I have about 75K (yikes) that I could get down to sub 2% territory. Thanks Fed! Also thanks to my husband for going into welding and having 0 student debt. 

I'm trying to get some clarity on the final numbers in either case. The mortgage refi as is would be the bigger savings but refinancing my student loans would be personally more significant for me - a good chunk are private and my dad has been hassling me for YEARS about them as he was a cosigner. It's been a huge strain on our relationship and having that be a non-issue would be a relief. I know emotions are the worst thing to base big financial decisions off of (just like taking huge student loans were in the first place, I graduated in 05 during that peak ""you absolutely must go to college or you're a failure"" ethos)

The biggest unknown is whether or not we could do both. As in - we already had this big loan go through and I know I could refi my student loans without an issue. BUT, if we were to refinance the mortgage would that be a big enough ding on our credit to cause a student loan refi not to go through (or at a less great rate). 

The biggest bummer would be if we started the process of refinancing the mortgage just to have rates bump up to where they were at when we financed in the first place. We're at 3.75, a great spot to be in considering the history of rates in general. I'm not going to lose sleep if we miss out on bargain basement rates. Our bank will let us do a recast in the future (we have already been planning on extra mortgage payments).",finance

personalfinance,Would paying off our car loan have a negative effect on applying for loans down the road?,"We have a car loan that will be paid off in about 18 months if we make the regular payments.

We're planning to buy a house in the next 1-2 years, which means applying for a mortgage. Would keeping the car loan improve our chance to get a better rate on that mortgage?

I realize paying off the car loan would save us some money on interest (I think around $250 over the next 18 months), but getting a better rate on the mortgage would save us much more in the long run. The question is whether keeping the car loan would truly make a difference at all.

personalfinance,Bad Year - Debt Consolidation Math Advice,"Hey all,

After a bad year I racked up some credit card debt after I had finally wiggled free. I can manage this, in fact I think I can pay it off in \~6 months, but I want to make sure I've got my head on straight if someone wouldn't mind indulging my math for a sec...

I owe \~10k on a card With a 21.3% apr. I was browsing and saw Upstart offering the best credit consolidation loan I seem to qualify for - they're giving me a 13.77% APR loan with a $600 origination fee... 

I just want to make sure I'm thinking about this right. It seems pretty simple to me, but that's what a lot of people say when making poor financial decisions... To do this math, I just need to:

* Divide the APR by 12 to get the monthly interest rate (mir)
* Multiply (mir) by the current principle of the card
* Subtract the expected monthly payment to get principle\` for that month
* Repeat, using principle\` until it hits $0 or less

Is that about right? I'm pretty sure I read that the interest is calculated by sampling your balance on a regular basis over the course of the month, but I'm guessing this isn't likely to produce significant discrepancies in the calculation...

If so then paying $2k per month to the card, I should have it all paid off in September, and the cumulative interest for each month, taking the payment and previous month's interest into account, seems like it comes to \~$650 (starting at \~$190 for March and going down by about $30 per month).

Right off the bat, given that there's a $600 origination fee on the loan and a 13.77% apr is going to rack up more than $50, it doesn't seem to make sense to consolidate... And even if I were to slip up for a month and end up getting charged a bit more interest, it would be a really close call as to whether I'd save any money on the loan...

That shakes out, right?",finance

Wow, everything is starting to get really scary. The only thing I can think of is: buy the Canadian dollar and oil stocks when oil goes down to &lt;$25 a barrel.

It is possible that we may limit down 7% on all of the US stock indices shortly after 9:30 AM open tomorrow, creating the 21^st century's own Black Monday (worse than August 24, 2015 or February 5, 2018).

Yes, be greedy when others are fearful and be fearful when others are greedy. But, stocks are still way too high for people with lots of cash on the sidelines.

First of all, I'm a Canadian in the province of Québec. I had a really rough past and an even worst year. due to health problem bla bla bla... I was living with  my insurance company amount that they were giving me. I had a bit of debts before the last year, but everything kinda went shit. So technically I have about, 20,000$ on a 19.98% credit card and I have a about 13,000$ on a line of credit. I tried to apply to two banks for a loan with written intent to close my big credit card but both didn't accept my case.

For my assets I only have my 2018 Mazda 3 for them to calculate so it's a bit because of that and also when I was sick I made half in a year than I make usually. I've heard about those credit cards that offer a promotionnal offer with a really low interest rate but I'm not sure they would accept to start a 20k$ credit card with me. I'm in a stable relashionship and we pay everything equally so that helps.

Right now I just came back from my year without a real salary and now I'll make roughly 50k$ per year instead of 21k$. I know that's great but with the budget I have it's practically impossible to live with this salary while I'm trying to catch up the delay from the payday of my new job.

I'm supposed to have about 2.5k$ in taxes soon. My plan was to simply take 1300$ and distribute that through my debts, and with the rest invest with mild to high risk stocks. I've always been goofd with that but never considered starting doing hit with real numbers. If I gain slowly some money this way I could invest safely a bit more and you kinda catch the pattern here!

Sincerely, anyone who takes the time to read this even if you don't answer, thank you I appreciate that you read this. And frankly I know it seems everyone on the internet has that, but I just got out of a major depression and honestly it was this close to win on me. I know it's cliché and bla bla but the reason I'm incluing this in is because right now with my new job that I just started and the future ahead, it's making a lot of pressureand stress, and I don't want to return on my bad path. Don't take this as pity but more like for me a reason to keep going.

personalfinance,Property investment conundrum - the UK vs Australia,"I'm an Australian living in the UK and have been here for 5 years. I've saved up lump sums on both sides of the world. They are both enough to put forward towards a deposit on a property. Currently, they are sitting in index funds.

I intend to head back to Australia in the medium-term future - 3 to 5 years - to settle down. At that point, I could have British citizenship as well.

My conundrum: I want to purchase a property, but where and how?

- Buy a property here in the UK as my rent is substantial enough to cover a mortgage repayment.
  - If I buy a property and then leave it as an investment, managing it from the other side of the world would be quite difficult. I would imagine letting agents would take me a ride unless I luck out and find a trustworthy one.
  - Considering the uncertainty in the British economy currently, this would be a long term investment if anything. I think over the long term it could be a fruitful investment.
  - If I leave the UK with a property but not being a British citizen, what kind of headaches could I have?

- Try to purchase a property in Australia.
  * I have found that getting a loan in Australia, while I'm employed/living in the UK results in less than favourable terms, e.g interest rates, total amount etc. I suspect this is due to the risk profile of me not working in the country.
  * Trying to organise purchasing a property over there from here might be tricky to get right. I can fly back to finalise things but the majority of the leg work has to be done from here.
  * I do have family who can assist with the management and possibly purchase. Although, I wouldn't want to defer responsibility on the purchasing aspect at least as it involves large amounts.

- I can keep saving my money and transfer it over to Australia, as the exchange rate is quite good - almost double to the pound.
  * I will continue to throw away more money to rent with this strategy.

- I could just call it quits in the UK and head home early.
  * I give up any getting British citizenship.
  * From a career perspective, it would be better to stick around for some more vital experience.
  * I'm not quite ready to head home yet as I'm still loving life here.

**Aside question:** If I buy in a property in one country and use the first-home owner benefits then do I void the equivalent in the other country?

Has anyone been in this position or have any experience I can draw on for some advice? I'm also looking for any recommendations of professionals I can seek out advice from on this matter.

I hope I didn’t cross any lines by posting some personal finance info, I just thought it would help if people decide to give advice. 

Recently graduated with my masters last May and am now straddled with debt. Wife and I both work, we make about $9k (US) after taxes per month. My student loans are at about $150k, right now I pay $1k/month and the interest rate is 6.85%. No car payment, no other debt, because of this we’ve been saving 40% of our income each month. Over the last 9 months we have been working on our emergency fund/savings and have saved $75k due to bonuses which are not expected to reoccur.

Now that we have our savings built up, we are trying to learn if it is smarter to keep renting ($1400/month) and pay our 40% savings each month to student loans (now that we have prepped our emergency/savings fund) or if it is smarter to use some of our savings to do an FHA loan on a property for somewhere in the range of $275k-$350k. Townhomes in our area appreciate on average at 12%, single family homes at 7.5%. We were thinking about putting the minimum down (3.5%) as we don’t want all our savings to go to the down payment. We supposedly live in a top 5 property appreciation state. 

We are talking about hopefully starting a family soon- if my wife stopped working completely our income would drop about $3k/month. Luckily I can work from home occasionally and she can go part time in the evenings at one of her jobs, so between providing our own childcare we are thinking we would lose about $1500/month. 

Given the background info, coupled with rumblings within the economy, we have no idea what to do to best help our family. We think it would be advantageous to buy, but are seeking advice. If there is someone out there who could help give us some direction we would love to find a way to thank you and pay it forward to someone in need down the line.",finance

Reasons for economy growth under Trump:
1. Pro Enterprise/ Pro Business Approach boosted confidence = more capital investment 
2. Deregulation  especially on energy which made America a net exporter of oil for the first time in 75 years.
3. Lower taxes for employees/employers which allowed them to expand &amp; hire more employees. Which in turn increased productivity which increased wages.

Under Obama earnings averages for top 25% remained higher throughout his administration. It has been been the reverse under Trump with the wage growth for the bottom 25% has been higher that the top 25% every month he’s been in office.
For the 1st time in 10 years, wage growth for low skill workers has matched wage growth for high skilled workers.

Under Trump, in just 3 years household incomes have gone up 5x more than 8 years under Obama.

personalfinance,How to start with investment properties?,"Hey all, I’ve been looking into investment properties/rentals/Air b&amp;b/etc for the last few years but I’ve never felt comfortable enough to jump in. I have several friends and old coworkers that are doing it and I want to get into it soon. Just looking for some advice on the best way to get started as well as any advice to be successful. I also have several connection with electricians/plumbers/carpenters/contractors/etc. that I feel could be very useful as well.

My current situation is I’m living in a house with my wife that is solely in my name (I bought it before I met her). I was able to get a good deal on my house as the market in my city was on the rise. Today, 4 years later, I’m predicting that I have about 40k in equity. 99k left on my 4% interest 30 year fixed mortgage and the property is probably worth about 140k (I haven’t done an appraisal yet). Me and my wife both have 770+ credit, and we make about 100k/year combined in a low cost of living area in a city in Nebraska. I have no debt and she has about 20k in student loan debt left. I’m also about 2 months away from obtaining my real estate license just from taking classes to try to educate myself if that matters or helps in any way.

We have a rough draft plan of maybe buying a new house that we like better, and keeping the old house and renting it out to start, but we are not sure the best way to go about it. We are open to ideas that would be better or make more sense.

Regardless of what I do next, I’m fairly positive I want to refinance my mortgage as rates are at an all time low and property values are at an all time high. I’ve done some research and found some quotes at a local credit union for 2.85% 20 year fixed or 3% 30 year fixed. After this I plan on looking into starting an LLC.

I’m lost on what to do next as it feels I have several options and questions...

- Do I refinance my mortgage at a lower interest rate at 20 years to pay it off faster with roughly the same payments? Or do I redo 30 years to try to keep my payments as low as possible?

- Do I take out all the equity I have in a refinance and use the money to upgrade my current house and get it ready to rent out and use the rest as a down payment on a new primary residence?

- Would it be smarter to use some of the refinance money to pay off my wife’s student loans that are about 6.5% interest?

- Would we even be allowed to refinance our current mortgage as a primary residence and then try to buy a new house as a primary residence with a new mortgage while renting out the old one?

- Would it be feasible to buy a new house while keeping the old one and using the equity in the first house to buy a 3rd house as an investment property?

personalfinance,Inheriting a house and mortgage from a grandparent.,"So, as I said, my grandmother has a practically untreatable diagnosis of multiple types of stage 4 cancers. She is currently on hospice, and it's very likely that she will need to move into a full-time care facility soon.

Now the mortgage on her house is fine, there's not a lot left on it relative to the value of the property, and I believe I can afford to pay it. But in terms of a residential care loan, I know they can get very expensive, depending on the location and time of the stay.Are rest homes different from palliative care? As I understand it palliative is free in NZ. Both myself, my mother and my grandmother don't want to see the house sold, it has sentimental value.

The current plan is to remortgage the house when I inherit it, consolidate mine and my mother's debt into the new mortgage so that we would have a lower interest rate, and also take some cash to make repairs to the house to make it rentable (the house has seen some neglect over the years). But the residential care loan threatens to make the mortgage too large to manage in my situation.

Do terminal patients often go into rest homes and is it a better choice for care than palliative care? Or is palliative care good enough to ensure my grandmother will be well treated? I don't want her to suffer neglect.

Is this a good plan? I understand that this is a tremendous windfall in the long term, but it does come with its own short term challenges.

Economics,What record-low interest rates mean,,finance
investing,The entire yield curve for U.S. bonds fall below 1% for the first time in history,"The entire yield curve for U.S. bonds fell below 1% for the first time in history after an all-out price war between the world’s biggest oil exporters triggered an unprecedented global bond rally.

U.S. Treasury yields plunged, with the rate on 30-year bonds diving as much as 59 basis points, as rising expectations the Federal Reserve will cut policy rates to 0% in the coming months drove investors to reach to longer maturities for yield. U.K. government bond yields tumbled below zero for the first time, Germany’s two-year bonds were close to a record, and rates in Australia and New Zealand fell to new lows.

The spread of the coronavirus and its fallout on supply chains and consumer spending have seen a dramatic repricing of global interest-rate expectations in the past month. The jolt lower in oil from the price war will sap inflation, increasing pressure on the Fed to take rates to the lowest since the global financial crisis.

“The more I think about it, the more it makes sense to me that that the U.S. cash rate will fall below zero some time very, very soon,” said Chris Rands, portfolio manager at Nikko Asset Management Ltd. in Sydney. “I wouldn’t be surprised if the U.S. tries negative rates, especially with the tailspin in oil now adding to the virus fears.”

The stampede for Treasuries comes after a weekend dominated by crisis headlines including the oil price-war, plunging Chinese exports and Italy’s virus-induced lockdown. Adding to the sense of malaise, Japan posted its biggest economic contraction in more than five years, while France said its economy may barely expand.

Risk assets plunged with S&amp;P futures dropping about 5% to hit circuit breakers, and European stocks plunged by the most since 2016, putting the STOXX Europe 600 Index on course for a bear market. Commodity-linked currencies weakened, with Norway’s krone and Canada’s dollar falling at least 1% against the U.S. dollar. Italian bonds plunged, sending the yield on 10-year debt to 1.23%.

Meanwhile, the yen and the euro strengthened. And the dollar, which suffered its worst week in two years, was up slightly, as soaring demand for U.S. Treasuries canceled out concerns that more Fed cuts would hurt the greenback’s appeal. The dollar has an edge over its peers by being the world’s reserve currency of choice.

**On a Tear**

Treasuries, the world’s deepest pool of haven assets, had been rallying in the past few weeks as the virus wreaked havoc across the globe. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell surprised markets last week with an emergency rate cut of 50 basis points, raising the specter that the virus fallout will be longer and worse than anticipated.

**Bad Old Days**

The yield on 10-year bonds dropped as much as 45 basis points to 0.31%, before settling at 0.5% as of 9:30 a.m. in London. Most of the German curve is now trading under negative 0.55%, which, together with the euro’s advance, may give the European Central Bank food for thought when it decides on interest rates this week.

“We know what the financial crisis looked like, the tech wreck, but this bond rally we’re seeing is just unchartered waters,” said Stephen Miller, adviser at GSFM, a unit of Canada’s CI Financial Group. “A global recession is now a probability, not a possibility.”

**Central Bank Action**

Markets are pricing almost 75 basis points of rate cuts by the Fed at the March meeting, with a return to the 0% lower bound expected by the end of the year. Some are speculating that the U.S. central bank will deploy unconventional policies used to combat the global financial crisis. That’s driving the larger moves in long-dated bonds.

Federal Reserve Bank of Boston President Eric Rosengren said Friday that policy makers should be allowed to buy a broader range of assets if they lack sufficient ammunition to fight off a recession with interest-rate cuts and bond purchases.

Money managers are expecting the Reserve Bank of Australia to turn to QE as soon as the middle the year, while bets are increasing for the Bank of Japan to ease this month.

“The market is panicking,” said Shinji Hiramatsu, a senior investment manager at Sompo Japan Nipponkoa Asset Management Co. in Tokyo. “Position adjustment, loss-cut buying and all sorts of buying are emerging. Everybody’s buying Treasuries.”

stocks,Today is a judge of who the weak hands are in the market.....,"I suggest anyone who is feeling scared and wants to sell, read this passage from a berkshire hathaway shareholder letter....

America’s economic achievements have led to staggering profits for stockholders. During the 20th century the Dow-Jones Industrials advanced from 66 to 11,497, a 17,320% capital gain that was materially boosted by steadily increasing dividends. The trend continues: By yearend 2016, the index had advanced a further 72%, to 19,763. American business – and consequently a basket of stocks – is virtually certain to be worth far more in the years ahead. Innovation, productivity gains, entrepreneurial spirit and an abundance of capital will see to that. Ever-present naysayers may prosper by marketing their gloomy forecasts. But heaven help them if they act on the nonsense they peddle. Many companies, of course, will fall behind, and some will fail. Winnowing of that sort is a product of market dynamism. Moreover, the years ahead will occasionally deliver major market declines – even panics – that will affect virtually all stocks. No one can tell you when these traumas will occur – not me, not Charlie, not economists, not the media. Meg McConnell of the New York Fed aptly described the reality of panics: “We spend a lot of time looking for systemic risk; in truth, however, it tends to find us.” **During such scary periods, you should never forget two things: First, widespread fear is your friend as an investor, because it serves up bargain purchases. Second, personal fear is your enemy. It will also be unwarranted.** Investors who avoid high and unnecessary costs and simply sit for an extended period with a collection of large, conservatively-financed American businesses will almost certainly do well.",finance

""Markets shuddered Monday—with U.S. stocks falling hard enough to trigger a trading halt—as a price war for oil and the economic fallout from the coronavirus frightened investors, who sought shelter in the safety of government bonds and propelled yields to unprecedented lows.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&amp;P 500 both fell 7% at the open, a drop that triggered circuit breakers that halted trading for 15 minutes.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average sank 1,885 points, or 7.3%, to 23980. The S&amp;P 500 fell 7% to 2764. And the Nasdaq Composite slid 6.9% to 7987.

All 11 sectors in the S&amp;P 500 were down, led by energy, which slid 10%. Financials were down 3.3%, and materials were down 2.6%.

Saudi Arabia’s decision over the weekend to instigate[ a price war ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/saudi-aramco-shares-fall-below-ipo-price-for-first-time-11583663747?mod=article_inline)as it escalates a clash with Russia sent oil prices down by the most since the Gulf War in January 1991. Crude prices, along with U.S. government bond yields, are typically viewed as key barometers of economic health and confidence, said Gregory Perdon, co-chief investment officer at private bankers Arbuthnot Latham.

“There has always been an assumption that when the oil price collapses the world is going to become a darker place, whether that is driven by the demand side or supply side,” Mr. Perdon said. The latest tensions put the oil market in somewhat uncharted territory with pressure in terms of both supply and demand as the coronavirus epidemic threatens to sap businesses’ appetite for energy.

 

The plunge in crude added to two weeks of turmoil in equity and credit markets as investors have grown increasingly concerned about economic growth stalling. It also raised fresh concerns about the risks tied to heavily indebted energy companies in the high-yield market, and the fallout for other companies if broader credit markets tighten.

U.S. government bonds, which have already rallied to unprecedented highs, extended gains. The yield on the 10-year Treasury, which moves inversely to bond prices, dropped to 0.431%. The 30-year yield fell below 1%, reaching 0.866%.

The Federal Reserve Bank of New York said Monday it will increase the amount of [very short-term loans ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/fed-increases-short-term-funding-to-keep-lending-markets-stable-11583756069?mod=article_inline)it has been offering to money markets amid the widening market rout. The move underscores the growing concerns about funding constraints and liquidity.

“The fear today is about a global recession,” said Thomas Hayes, chairman of Great Hill Capital, a hedge fund-management firm based in New York. “If Russia does not come back to the table soon, investors worry the default risk and credit spreads widening will lead to tighter credit and even a recession.”

Public-health authorities are escalating efforts to contain the coronavirus outbreak, leading to a drop in business activity and curtailing global trade. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases has exceeded 110,000, with over 3,800 fatalities globally. At least eight American states including New York have declared states of emergency as infections spread to new parts of the U.S., and Italy quarantined some 17 million people.

“It’s a falling knife situation,” said Esty Dwek, head of global market strategy at Natixis Investment Managers. “You don’t need to be buying on a day like today.”

Brent crude, the global gauge of oil prices, shed 23% to $35.01 a barrel, while U.S. crude futures dropped 23% to $31.69 a barrel.

Ahead of the opening bell in New York, U.S. energy producers were among the hardest hit. [Chevron](https://quotes.wsj.com/CVX) and [Exxon Mobil](https://quotes.wsj.com/XOM) dropped over 15% in premarket trading. Smaller energy companies plummeted even more, with [Devon Energy](https://quotes.wsj.com/DVN), [Occidental Petroleum](https://quotes.wsj.com/OXY) and [Marathon Oil](https://quotes.wsj.com/MRO) stocks dropping over 30%.

Rising defaults among U.S. energy producers may make it harder for companies in other sectors to access credit markets, analysts said.

“That ultimately is the negative aspect to lower oil,” said Viktor Hjort, head of credit strategy at BNP Paribas. “There is a real risk, and that is tighter credit conditions.”

The price war between major oil producers is “throwing petrol on the fire” at a time when investors are struggling to understand how deeply the outbreak will impact global supply chains and consumer spending, according to Lyn Graham-Taylor, a rates strategist at Rabobank.

“We have got a massive demand decline brought about by the virus and now you’ve got headline inflation going through the floor: all combinations that say we need to do more easing,” Mr. Graham-Taylor said.

Stocks in the European energy sector led markets lower in the region, with [BP](https://quotes.wsj.com/BP) plummeting over 20% in London. Anglo-Dutch firm Royal Dutch Shell, Norway’s Equinor, Italy’s Eni, the U.K.’s BHP Group and France’s Total were also among the big decliners.

That led the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 index down over 6.6% with key equity benchmarks in the U.K. and France entering bear-market territory.

Foreign-exchange markets also faced [renewed volatility ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/market-turmoil-cascades-through-currencies-11583739387?mod=searchresults&amp;page=1&amp;pos=3&amp;mod=article_inline)on Monday, as steep drops in oil sparked a flight from commodity-linked currencies. The Russian ruble lost 8.3%, while the Norwegian Krone dropped 2.8%.

In the Asia-Pacific region, the S&amp;P/ASX 200 index in Australia dropped 7.3%, suffering its worst day since October 2008, during the depths of the global financial crisis. That puts the gauge close to bear-market territory, which is typically defined as a peak-to-trough decline of more than 20%. Japan’s Nikkei 225 index closed down 5.1%, its biggest daily drop since 2016, while the benchmark stock index in Shanghai dropped more than 3%.

The Japanese yen, which often rallies in times of market stress, surged 2.9% to trade below 103 to the dollar, at its strongest levels since 2016. Gold, which is also normally considered a haven asset during times of turmoil, edged up 0.3%.  


“We are in uncharted territory now,” according to Hubert de Barochez, markets economist at Capital Economics. “Up until last week, what we were seeing was bond yields lower, stocks hurt and riskier currencies getting hit, but the idea was that if good news were to come all these moves would revert.""",finance

\*\*\*

# COVID-19 + oil crash: How to respond

*Markets sold off and the S&amp;P 500 halted trading for 15 minutes after a 7% fall. Here's what investors should do.*

**What's happened?**

Risk assets slumped and safe havens soared on Monday as a collapse in oil prices added to the complexity facing global investors grappling with the spread of COVID-19. Brent crude futures fell more than 20%, the worst single day sell-off since January 1991, after Saudi Arabia slashed its official oil prices and signaled a significant production boost. This followed the failure of OPEC to secure additional production curbs from Russia.

Equity markets fell sharply in Asia (KOSPI –4.0% Hang Seng –3.5%, and CSI 300 -3.4%) with even larger declines in Europe in morning trade. At the time of writing, the Stoxx Europe 600 index was down 7.4%, its sharpest fall since the Brexit referendum vote and Italy’s FTSE MIB index was down 11%. The S&amp;P 500 opened 7% lower, triggering a 15-minute halt to trading.

US 10-year Treasuries fell by 28bps to a record low of 0.43%. The number of countries with negative bond yields also continued to expand: Five-year UK yields traded below zero for the first time, and France, Germany, Spain, Portugal, Sweden, the Netherlands, Switzerland and Japan are all trading in negative territory. With 65% of Eurozone bonds at negative yields, sharp increases in risk premiums leave only Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain positive on the 10-year yield.

The dollar came under further pressure, dropping by 1.6% versus the euro, its sharpest single-day decline since January 2018, and the yen jumped 3.4% versus the dollar, having fallen more than 9% since 20 February when coronavirus concerns intensified. The Swiss franc has appreciated 2.5% ytd against the euro, to its strongest level since July 2015. Gold is now up by 6% since the end of February, and is trading at its highest levels since 2013.

**What are we watching?**

Factors which could continue to have a negative impact on markets include:

* **News of further spread of COVID-19.** The virus remains uncontained in Europe and the US, with infection numbers continuing to grow. In Europe there are now more than 10,000 cases and Italy recorded 133 deaths in one day, similar to levels China experienced during the height of its outbreak in February. The Italian government imposed travel restrictions to and from parts of northern Italy, which are economically important and hold a population of some 16 million people. Such restrictions increase the chance of a sharp economic slowdown, and news of similar restrictions being imposed in other economically important regions of the world would likely be taken badly by the market.
* **The oil price shock and impact on credit markets.** Lower oil prices in themselves are not a negative for the global economy. But the scale of the adjustment in prices will be challenging for the market to absorb. Given the energy sector’s 14% weighting in the US high yield index, fears about defaults in the sector could lead to wider outflows and problems accessing credit for non-energy businesses. The new issue-market has frozen, creating difficulties for companies needing to raise capital, but we note that only 2.3% of US high yield debt is maturing in the next year. In the credit default swap market, the iTraxx EUR crossover index widened by 120bps on Monday, to reach its highest level since the Eurozone sovereign debt crisis in 2012.
* **The yield curve and impact on financial conditions.** The market has priced the Fed cutting the fed funds rate to zero (100bps of cuts) by the end of the year, and curves are flattening, indicating some expectation that the Fed will relaunch QE. A flat yield curve and cash rates at or below zero are not a positive for the banking sector and could lead to fears about credit provision to the real economy. With credit markets currently closed to new issuance the only source of funding for corporates is currently banks and central banks.

These factors, and investor deleveraging, are likely to continue to contribute to market volatility in the near term. However, amid this weekend’s negative news there were also positive signs on both the efforts to control the virus and policymakers’ response. We are monitoring developments in four main areas that could lead us to take a more positive view on the outlook.

* **Evidence of successful virus containment.** Amid the negative news over the weekend, the number of new cases in China—excluding Hubei province and imported cases—dropped to zero. In Korea, which has the highest number of cases outside China, the rate of increase in new cases is now also slowing, with cases now doubling after nine days, instead of three days in late February. Growing evidence that the virus can be contained in a relatively short time period with specific policies could engender market and business confident that the outbreak needn't be prolonged. Evidence that more countries are having success in containing the virus and slowing new infections would also be a clear positive.
* **Clarity on the net economic impact.** In the near-term, the focus of consumers is likely to be on avoiding exposure to the virus, and the resulting reduction in spending on travel and leisure activities will bring a near-term economic cost. But should fears begin to ease, consumers could begin to respond to the significant recent drop in oil prices (and hence gasoline prices) and mortgage rates (US 30-year fixed rates are now 3.29%, from 4.41% a year ago). We should also note that, prior to the virus outbreak the US economy was on a solid footing—as illustrated by last Friday’s strong non-farm payrolls report.
* **Concerted policy response.** The latest news is rapidly bringing forward the prospect of greater fiscal stimulus. Hong Kong has announced fiscal measures and Italy’s Prime Minister, Giuseppe Conte said that “We will use a massive shock therapy.” Fiscal measures are also being discussed in other countries, like Germany and the US. While interest rates are already close to zero, monetary policymakers can also respond with measures like quantitative easing. The crisis may also provide ""cover"" for some countries to experiment with coordinated monetary and fiscal action.
* **Valuations**. Valuation is rarely a catalyst in itself, but it can provide nervous investors with a yardstick for potential long-term performance. The decline in bond yields alongside falling equity prices has made equities even more attractive on a relative basis. The 12-month trailing earnings yield on the S&amp;P 500 is now 5.4%, compared to 10-year bond yields of 0.5%. The gap of 4.9% is the largest since 2013. The 12-month trailing European earnings yield of 7.1% is 7.9ppts higher than the German bund yield of –0.87%, the widest since August last year.

**What to do?**

The near-term market focus is likely to remain on the virus's spread across Europe and the US, and on stress in the financial markets. The more positive recent developments—including evidence of successful virus containment in Asia, higher potential disposable income for consumers, fiscal and monetary loosening, and more favorable equity valuations, may take time to feed through into market pricing. Volatility is therefore likely to remain elevated, and we reiterate our longstanding recommendations for investors to diversify their portfolios and consider protection strategies.

Given current reduced liquidity in a number of markets, investors should also be particularly cautious about taking rushed decisions in times of volatility, noting that bid-offer spreads in equities, and particularly in credit, are likely to be wider than normal at present. By incorporating the Liquidity. Longevity. Legacy.\* strategies to align portfolios with financial goals, investors can manage the risk of making rash decisions that can be costly during periods of market stress.

That said, we continue to see opportunities for investors to enhance and diversify their portfolios, and build positions for the long-term. We reiterate the recommendations and strategies we outlined in our 6 March note, **“10 days later: Where do we stand?,”** offering guidance on the outlook and recommended portfolio strategies for the current environment:

* **Prefer emerging market stocks** over developed markets, given higher expected earnings growth, better valuations, a lower US dollar, and China's relative success in containing the virus. Since 19 February, emerging markets have outperformed developed markets by 3.3%. We expect this trend to continue.
* **For those who can implement options, put-writing strategies can help investors take advantage of higher equity volatility.** With the VIX at 58 and V2X at 59, the yield available from put writing is elevated, and the strategy can provide an effective way for investors with excess cash holdings to 'buy the dip' in a disciplined way, without succumbing to behavioral biases.
* **Favor strategies, which enhance portfolio yield,** including buying dividend stocks and US high yield credit, amid record-low yields and falling rates. While there is scope for further near-term spread widening in HY, over a six-month time horizon we expect spreads to be considerably tighter. Meanwhile, green bonds represent a less cyclical alternative to investment grade credit, and with much lower oil exposure. Investors can also consider whether lower borrowing costs tilt the arithmetic in favor of strategies involving leverage.
* **Prepare for further dollar weakness over the medium term**. With the Fed likely to cut rates by more than the European Central Bank, the long-held US yield advantage is set to shrink. Since 19 February, the US dollar has weakened by 5.4% against the euro and 5.9% against the Swiss franc, with EURUSD now at 1.14. Our forecast is for further dollar weakness over the course of the year, and project EURUSD at 1.19 by December 2020.
* **Risk-averse investors may consider measures to protect portfolios against coronavirus risks**, including exposure to gold and longer-duration US Treasuries (we prefer TIPS to nominals). Since 19 February, gold prices have rallied by 3.7% and TIPS by 2%, and long-duration Treasuries have rallied 14.7%.
* **Use the drop in prices to buy into long-term themes.** The recent market volatility presents an opportunity for investors to build up portfolio allocations to long-term investment themes. Even after the current crisis passes, an aging global population, developments in healthtech, and recent strides in genetic therapies all offer long-term investment opportunities for investors seeking long-term portfolio growth. The crisis may also accelerate longer-term trends in connectivity, and localization, benefiting companies exposed to the fourth industrial revolution and digital transformation.

personalfinance,Advice for those looking to refinance their mortgage.,"TLDR: Don't forget to consider your current lender when shopping options for refinancing.

With interest rates at an all time low, the sub is being bombarded with people looking for info regarding refinancing. For the most part these posts are all the same, but after reading so many, I noticed one piece of advice wasn't really being asked or given, and I'm not sure if it is because it is super obvious to most people, but I wanted to take a second to share anyway.

There are two main factors you should take into account when deciding whether or not to refinance. Can you lower your rate, and is the new lower rate worth the upfront cost of the refinance? Right now, chances are most people can find a lower rate available than what they currently have. So that just leaves the fees, and brings me to my advice. While you are shopping around for your best options, do not forget to contact your current lender. I had received several offers via email from my current lender for a straight rate reduction, but it was for only like a quarter of a percent lower than my current rate, while other lenders were advertising a full point or more lower. I assumed this was the best they were willing to offer, and focused my efforts on shopping other lenders.

I was nearly ready to close with another lender when I decided to give my current lender a call. I explained exactly what the other lender was offering, and not only were they willing to beat the rate by another 1/8th percent, but as my existing lender they were able to waive all closing costs except for third party title fees. They required no appraisal, my current escrow carries over to my new loan so no extra prepaid funds were required, and I can either skip the first month's payment, or make the payment as usual, and the entire amount for that month will go towards principle. All in all, I ended up at 2.625 rather than 2.75, and my closing costs dropped from over 5k to under 1500. Plus, I know they are going to continue servicing my loan. They won't end up reselling it, and sticking me with some company I'm not happy dealing with.

Again, I'm sure this is obvious to most people on this sub, but hopefully it helps someone out.

EDIT: User xt1nct has brought it to my attention that when you refinance with your existing lender, you give up what is know as your ""Right of Rescission"", which allows you the opportunity to undo your loan within 3 days of closing, for any reason, no questions asked. The lender is also required to refund any fees within 20 days of your exercising this right. Unfortunately, when you refinance with your existing lender, no such right is afforded.

So, while I still believe it is worth contacting your existing lender to see what options are available,  you should certainly take this into consideration, and be even more diligent before committing to anything you may have second thoughts about later.

 EDIT 2: Quite a few people are reaching out asking for lender recommendations based on their specific circumstances. Unfortunately, as I have said previously, I am not a mortgage expert in any sense of the word, I was only hoping to share my experience in case it could help anyone in a similar situation. I am not qualified to make recommendations on any individual lender. If you are really at a loss on where to start, you would probably be well served by a mortgage broker that can do the legwork for you, and present you with many more options than you would want to research on your own.

personalfinance,In the middle of a home refinance,"Hey all, I’m reaching out to ask for some guidance.

I started the process of refinancing my home 2 weeks ago.  Locked in my rate at 3.5% (down from 4.625), but since then the Fed cut rates and its looking like that will do it again soon.

I realize my lender isn’t going to bid against themselves, so I’m not sure if I should continue with my current rate or should I scrap is and start anew with the hopes of getting an even better deal on my loan?

Thanks in advance!",finance
investing,Are treasuries actually that low risk??,"Treasuries are always touted as low risk, which is why people are dumping into them right now.

Treasury prices have exploded beyond all time highs though. The market clearly expects the price to keep rising (and yields to keep falling), as we barrel towards negative rates.

But as with any asset at ATHs, couldn't treasury supply/demand suddenly reverse?

What if the fed floods the market with a ton of new debt to fund stimulus, once rate drops prove ineffective to curing the virus? What if the fed prints a ton of new money? They clearly don't want negative rates, so I doubt we'll see the fed purchasing rates even lower by massive treasury purchases. What if this is China's moment to exercize their nuclear option and dump treasuries, in a bid to decouple oil from the USD?

I'm looking for commentary from someone who understands this better than me. Please feel free to tell me these scenarios are absurd, but I just hope for informed and sourced responses. 

Thanks!!",finance
personalfinance,Refi after purchase 6 months ago?,"Purchased a home back in August for 199k, put down 5%. We currently have a 3.99% rate, 30 year term. Now that interest rates have dropped, I wanted to look into refinancing to reduce the monthly payment if it’s worth.

personalfinance,How bad is it to owe taxes at the end of the tax year 2020? California and Federal,"I’ve recently changed my tax withholding to give me more per paycheck, Using the pay tables, I calculated a liberal estimate to play things on the safe side even though I changed it because I’m sick of the government holding my money interest free. At which point will the government penalize me for not having enough withheld from my paycheck?",finance
personalfinance,Do I really want to buy a house this week?,"We've been looking for a home in San Francisco for a while now and got incredibly lucky enough in startup lotteries so we can afford to buy. Our kids are getting bigger and our condo is feeling really small right now. We're looking in the 2-2.5m range because that's what a single family house costs here.

Lucky for me, I moved most of my volatile savings into a cash position at the start of the collapse so we're pretty resilient to the current downturn.

Some details on the house transaction:

\- off-market ask price $2.5m  
\- likely auction price (as of two weeks ago) $3m  
\- the house has a legal second suite renting for $3k/mo right now  
\- financing: 1.1m, 2.98% @ 30y fixed / 1.4m cash

The other complication is that the sellers want to stay in the home until the school year ends in June, which means I won't be able to sell our current place until the summer, which in a rapidly changing market like this one feels pretty unsettling.

My realtor is pushing me to make an offer at the seller's ""buy it now"" price before they put it on the market and the house is exactly what we've been looking for for a year now... but obviously with the chaos in the market I'm having some doubts.

I'm looking for thoughts and advice from people who don't have a financial incentive to get me to buy. My basic concern is that if I wait a month things will look much more favorable both in terms of price and interest rates and there is always another house out there... but this one is far and away the best we've seen.",finance
personalfinance,All 3 credit bureaus show my credit above 775. Got told by my mortgage lender this morning that my score is 651,"I have no idea what to do. I opened my first credit card at 20 (I am 29 now) and have been monitoring my credit for about 7 years, it has always been between 765-810 and currently shows 775, 777, and 781 across the 3 bureaus. I have 55,000 available credit across a few accounts and am only utilizing \~4,000 of it total, never missed a payment on anything in my life.

Only bad thing on it: 3 years ago I had a gas bill for $30 sent to collections because I didn't know about it--it was a utility shut off bill apparently mailed to me after I had already moved out and my landlord never sent it to my forwarding address, nor was I ever called by the company or collections. I didn't find out about it until it popped up on my credit monitoring maybe 4 months late at which point I paid it immediately. This is the only thing I have ever had sent to collections. I have in the past asked the company if they would take it off my credit report or provide a letter of deletion and they said they ""don't do that."" However, since this was the only bad mark on my score and my scores were still showing up as pretty good, I didn't stress too much about it. But then last night my mortgage lender called me to let me know my score shows up as 651 when he runs it. I'm LIVID.

Could that one thing really be enough to tank my score 120 entire points in the eyes of mortgage lenders? Should I ask a different lender or will it be the same across the board? How can I possibly get my credit up now, it feels impossible? Excuse my language but I am fucking crushed, I am trying to buy my first house right now and this would raise the PMI from $18/month to over $140 a month and increase my interest rate by a full percent. I feel simultaneously really sad and also bitter that I have tried to be so good about financial planning and financial responsibility and now it feels like it was all for nothing...

personalfinance,Mortgage Rates Are Low. My Chance To Retire Is High?,"Hi Friends!

I have a question for you all regarding the current Low Mortgage interest Rates.  First of all I was able to take advantage 5 years ago and took a 15 year 2.75% interest rate on our Mortgage, our payment went up approx. $500 (due to a promotion I received) and in addition we have regularly paid anywhere from $30-$150 extra principle a month when we can- because I am SO desperate to pay our mortgage off before we are 60! With that said we have 9 years 10months left to pay our mortgage off in full but I am considering refinancing to another 15 year mortgage at 2.625 % (not much difference) but it would free up $736 monthly.  The extra money would be used to pay off a HELOC we recently got and would allow for some extra room but it's not necessary (we have no other bills, no car payments, credit cards etc.)  I received an estimate for the closing cost and we would be adding 8K to our current loan plus the 5 years, and this is just killing me the thought of my principle balance going up after paying extra over the last 5 years, but the thought of extra cash per month would be nice. Were kind of thinking of retirement in the next 5 years (would like to retire early 56/57 years old).   Struggling what to do, do we refinance or leave as is and if we decide to retire early maybe get a part time job for a few years until our mortgage is paid?  Our mortgage is currently $3050, it would drop to $2390.  In addition I am set to make an additional 10K per year at my current job over the next 2 years.  Should we just stay put or go for it???  


Thank you all in advance

personalfinance,Can you help me understand how home ownership is good to build wealth?,"I've never owned my own house before and I'm thinking about buying one. However, the way mortgage works gets me confused a bit. For example, if I put a down payment of $50K for a house worth $350K and took out a mortgage worth $300K with a 30 year fixed (4% interest rate) do I pay back $515K (principal+interest)? So, the house that I bought for $350K would cost me $565K (mortgage+down payment) without factoring in any closing costs+taxes+upkeep? Does that mean my house needs to appreciate at least 60-70% to break even (again without factoring in any additional costs and inflation)?",finance

stocks,Markets sadomasochism!,"Most Speculators and investors derive a great pleasure by being savagely beaten down by markets fluctuations! Given the historical precedents of market shocks and panics, one would expect the average investors to be cautious and conservative with their savings; and, even avoid investing altogether unless fully secured with low risk/low rewards investment vehicles.
But as history shows time and time again, most investors simply refuse to accept facts and evidences but rather, they fall unto the fantasy and desillusion of hitting the jackpot and retiring rich to the sunset.

Despite the obvious signs of an impeding market collapse, people are still debating whether they ought to ""buy the new lows"", ""hold their positions"", or ""wait for the gov to intervene."" If that isn't insanity, I don't know how to describe it! Look brothers, the markets would have corrected anyhow, Coronavirus or no Coronavirus. It is merely a BLACKSWAN EVENT"". Such events only occur on a FRAGILE SYSTEM. 

The foundations of the world leading economies repose on pseudo macro Keynesian economics that cyclically lead to boom and bust cycles. Rather than dealing with the problems at hand; low interest rates, gov interventionism, bailouts, credit driven manias, world leaders continuously repeat the previously failed policies of quantitative easing and pilling debt on top of piles of debts. Everyone is aware that such formula just do not WORK! 

The average guy sees that, he knows what is going on and is aware of the media deceit and the institutional lies. Yet, driven by hubris and arrogance, he wants to mimic Warren Buffett and follows Jim Cramer's advices. All against his own sound, good, and common sense. 

Or, like I stated in my intro, most people just like to lose. They derive a sadistic pleasure in watching their bleeding portfolios. It is more enthralling than sitting still with the  boring safety of sitting still on the sideline, safe and protected while the fire is ravaging the Street.

personalfinance,California - Should my friend list military experience on resume if it was related to him getting kicked out of the military and getting a misdemeanor conviction,"I'm posting this for a friend who currently lives with relatives who don't have internet.

So my friend served active duty in the U.S. military for from 2015 to 2017 out of a four year contract. The **reason why only two years is because he got kicked out after pleading guilty to a misdemeanor in a civilian court.**

**Originally, he was arrested and charged for a felony and misdemeanor,** but **he had to plead guilty to the misdemeanor** since the risk and cost of a trial would be too much.

Now   he got his Associates Degree in 2018, but the problem is that he is   still on probation until April 2020. Now, my friend would just wait   until probation is over before getting an expungement, but life is   passing him by and he wants to get a job and a girlfriend ASAP. Being   broke and with a criminal record isn't doing anything good for him...he   wants change now.

He is   essentially tired of waiting. He did try to have a lawyer petition for   an early termination of probation and expungement (which you could do in   California if you're at the halfway point of probation), but the judge   denied my friend, stating he had to finish the entirety of his   probation.

**So should my friend list a job on his resume that he had in which he got fired because of a conviction?**   He can't exactly get out of omitting why he left the military either   because his DD-214 says ""Commission of a Serious Offense"" for his   discharge characterization.

The problem I see is two fold...

1. He   gets his expungement and omits his military work history. But  employers  will raise an eyebrow if he has no work history since  graduating high  school in 2014. Moreso, my friend does have a  preference to work in a  local, state, or federal capacity for the  government since he wants a  pension. But he's fine with working for  private companies as well,  provided there's room for advancement and  opportunities to be set up for  retirement.
2. He   leaves his military work history on there. Employers are impressed he   is a veteran, but are dissapointed as to why he left the military after   looking at his DD-214. They will also suspect he committed some sort  of  crime because of his ""commission of a serious offense""  characterization.",finance
personalfinance,Is it a good idea to do a Cash Out Refinance in this situation? Mother living paycheck to paycheck her father is sick/won't be able to make payments soon.,"Hi all,

My family is in kind of a pickle coming up in the future and I would like to fix the situation before it's too late. My mom and grandparents live together and split the mortgage payments. However, my grandpa recently had a stroke and doesn't have much longer to live. Without his contributions, my mom can't afford the mortgage payments. So since it seems to be a good time, I suggested refinancing the home.

So here are the details.

House purchased for ~350,000 in 2001

Interest rate at the time was around 3.25-3.35%

My mom also made a mistake a while ago and opened another loan for 200,000.

Currently there is 138,000 left to pay off the mortgage.

And there is another 138,000 to pay off the other loan that was opened.

So she owes a total of ~270,000. She has no other debt.

The current house value is 750,000 to 800,000 in the Los Angeles area.

Her credit score is 715-740 depending on where you look.

She pays about 2300 a month with the property taxes included in the monthly payments and another ~2400 a month for the extra loan.

I am getting quotes that if we do a cash out refinance, we can combine the loan and the mortgage into one and lock in about ~1200 a month for 30 years...plus about 500-600 a month for the property tax a month. That will put us at about 1800 or so a month with about 3.25% interest.

Our goal is to reduce her monthly payments as much as possible as it's been a real struggle for her to make these payments every month, essentially rendering her to live paycheck-to-paycheck. Would it be smart for us to bite the bullet and do the refinance if she is opposed to selling the home altogether? I know the monthly is much lower with this method but asking you guys on Reddit incase there is something I am missing in my calculations or something I didn't think about.

Let me know if I have any missing details that you need. Thanks!",finance

personalfinance,Need professional opinion regarding removal of PMI,"I've been contemplating ways to remove PMI on my home and I could use some guidance. 

Here is the background on my home loan -

My home appraised for $235,000 in 2014 when my wife and I purchased the home. We ended up paying $228,000 for the home in March of 2014. We both had just began our careers and did not have a large down payment so only 5% was paid down and the mortgage loan was initiated at $216,885 for 30yr/360mo at 3.75% interest.

We have since been paying off other loans such as cars and student loans and finally in April of this year, we will be debt free aside from our mortgage.

Currently we owe $197,885 on the loan and I would love to get out of our PMI. Our market has been booming over the last few years and Zillow estimates our home value to be $301,000 currently.

* Is the PMI based on LTV from mortgage loan amount, initial appraisal amount, or purchase price

$197,885 = 91.2% LTV from mortgage loan amount 

$197,885 = 84.2% LTV from initial appraisal amount (235,000)

$197,885 = 86.7% LTV from purchase price (228,000)

&amp;#x200B;

* Can I remove PMI without refinancing by getting a second appraisal and petitioning the bank to remove the PMI? I am not really wanting to refinance the mortgage, but if the numbers say I should, I'll consider it (especially with the high likely hood of 3% or better interest rates in the future).

Even if the home appraises at $260,000, that puts my LTV at 76% - which should meet the &lt;78% criteria, correct?

Currently PMI is 88$/mo.

personalfinance,Helping a friend with financial advice and how to handle their debt,"Hi all,

As someone who keeps on top of their finances and takes managing them pretty seriously, a friend reached out asking if I could help them with their situation. I have helped develop a financial plan for her, but since I have no debt, this is a new realm for me. I want to check I am providing sound advice.

To preface, I did let her know I am not a financial advisor and she should consult one, and advised her to see if her employer offers free consultations.

She makes around $50k a year and around $2450 in monthly expenses (includes car payment). She has the following debts due to some past poor financial decisions, but is wanting to get back on track:

* $1644 in collections
* $8000 in collections for a past repo'd car, but they have said they will accept $4000
* $514 in overdue tolls, to which they are adding a late fee of $5/month
* $2568 in overdue tolls (a different toll agency), to which they are adding a late fee of $5/month
* $1200 in debt to a community college, doesn't appear to be adding interest/fees currently
* $13,559 owed on a car loan at a 18% interest rate (yes... 18%)
* $912 owned to a furniture store, but interest free for 60 months

The car issue goes further since it is now worth about $3500 and has a bunch of issues that might end up making it not driveable, according to her brother who is a mechanic and is (understandably) tired of fixing it. She wants to get something more reliable, but I am weary of her going to get another loan.

I looked on BankRate and she is getting rates of around 20% for debt consolidation loans... so that doesn't seem like an option.

So far I made a rough plan for her:

1. Make a monthly budget and reduce any unnecessary expenses (got her to switch to a lower phone plan and seeing if there are cheaper internet plans)
2. Build an emergency fund of 1 months expenses (she has around $2000 in savings but car repairs might consume this)
3. Negotiate and pay off both debts in collections
4. Build emergency fund to 3-6 months of expenses
5. Start to pay off debt:
   1. Overdue tolls $514
   2. College debt $1200
   3. Overdue tolls $2568
   4. Car $14,000 (even though the interest rate is high, I thought it better to pay off debt at risk of the other debts going to collections)
6. Pay off the interest free debt to the furniture store (despite being interest free, it should have a small amount left by this stage)
7. Evaluate IRA (she already matches 401k)
8. Look into a new car (she is weary about waiting this long with the condition of her current car)
9. At this stage start maxing out retirement
10. Any future goals here!

Now I don't know if this is extreme, but is bankruptcy an option? From my research it looks like her credit will be shot for 7 years, but she might be able to start over fresh.

So I feel slightly in over my head but we're both glad we're starting to get her a plan instead of letting it get worse with time.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated!",finance

We are refinancing the home loan (dropping the interest rate from 4.25 to 3.125). The car loan is 0% for the first 4 years (so no point in paying that off early), and we should have it paid off by then without issue.

That leaves us with about 15k in our savings account.

You cannot time the market. Anyone tells you “buy the dip” or “it’s a good time to buy” just ignore them. They don’t know. Jim Cramer doesn’t know. Trump doesn’t know. No one knows. So please stop asking. 

Buy companies you’re comfortable buying and holding for a very long time at a reasonable price. Reasonable price is relative for each sector and also depends on prevailing interest rates. If you’re not comfortable making this judgement and picking stocks this way, buy the index. 

Buy over time. Enter when you feel comfortable but not with your entire capital. Wait a few weeks and buy again. Only use money you can forget about for several years. If you ignore the noise and buy companies you’d be happy with as a private owner or accumulate ownership of an index fund, you will accumulate wealth over time. If you try to get rich you will most likely mess up. Avoid leverage if you can. 

Last but not least, if you cannot tolerate large losses, and I mean 40-50%, equity investing is not for you. Accept this and buy real estate or other private assets that don’t have daily price quotes.

personalfinance,Amended 2018 return,"Hi PF,

I am somewhat kicking myself here; hoping someone can clear some questions up for me. Unfortunately, I believe I misunderstood a rule and may now be paying the price.

**Feb 2018** \- I filed my 2018 tax return; no probs

**March 2018** \- I receive an unexpected 2018 1099-MISC from when I did a little freelance yoga teaching. I had emailed the owner in January asking about a 1099 and never got a reply, so I assumed that I didn’t make enough to receive one. Guess I was wrong!

So, I log into TurboTax and file an Amended 1040X; finish out the process; print all my stuff and write the checks (I owed around $210 between Fed and State) and then **read** that I had three years to file an Amended 1040X with the added 1099-MISC so I put the envelopes on a shelf and said that I would do it all with my 2019 taxes.

Well, here I am, filing my 2019 taxes and so I rewrote the checks and dropped the amended 1040x in the mail.

In the meantime I had a rejection on one of my 2019 state returns (the previous state where I had filed the 2018 returns), and realized it was because TurboTax was pulling in the adjusted AGI from the amended return thus giving me the rejection **because I hadn’t filed the amended return until today and their records don’t reflect.** I aligned the numbers to match the unadjusted return and refiled.

So now, I have sent my amended 2018 with the payment due via mail today and submitted my 2019 with payment set up accordingly.

I hope that makes sense.

I see now that the whole “three year thing” for amending a return is if you’re OWED money; not if you OWE any. Should I be majorly worried about this? Will the IRS be vigilant in charging me penalties on the taxes I had owed on the 1099-MISC from 2018?

I do have the “audit protection” from TurboTax but I don’t think that would really help me here since it was a misunderstanding on my part.

I was going to college about 4 years ago and then dropped out 20 hours short of a bachelor's degree in Biomed with the sole intention of pursuing aPh.D.   The last year that I was in college,  I broke off an engagement with a man I had been for 7 years.

Usually reminding people to buy gold, bonds, short market, and short gas and oil etfs. We’re only about halfway to the bottom (if we’re lucky) who here is buying the dip? Who here will cut their loses and sell?

Half of the workers in our economy are women. Many of them have children. In the near future, daycare centers (and schools) will begin to close to prevent the spread of disease. During that time, women will become highly unproductive to the economy [insert joke about women ever being productive here]. It isn't a matter of if, but when.

Additionally, consumer goods stock is dwindling in warehouses all across the country, as are supplies and materials for assembly and manufacturing. Just because something is ""made in the USA"" doesn't mean its components are. There is a significant lag time between when the shipping lanes stopped moving goods (and Chinese factories scaled back) to when the supply shock hits the US.

Today's bump in market prices was speculation over Fed rate hikes by the media to shake retail investor's puts out of the market. The media is owned by very rich people who leverage uncertainty by creating predictable market gyrations and profiting from them. That is what happened today and will continue to happen. Don't panic into the market during the next few weeks unless you want to lose money. Do not buy back into the market as a retail investor until after daycare centers have begun closing. Some time after that is when the bottom will be found.

People should remember that for the first half of Feb the stock market remained elevated, even though everyone had access to the information that plainly showed China was a total mess. The market does not act timely, and it doesn't always take all information into account, it is a herd of humans behaving more like a swarm, and it isn't as intelligent as many like to pretend. If you flash a bright light at a swarm you can influence its flight path, the same is true of the market when flashed with media headlines. The fundamentals don't lie.

Even with reinvested dividends, an investor who bought 7 years ago would still be bleeding from all holes and there is no end in sight!

If you look under the hood, you notice that a lot of the stocks are of the Financials (Banks and Insurance Companies), REITs, Utilities and Telecom, and a tiny Energy sector.

On the one hand, I feel like this is a once-in-a-lifetime buying opportunity to snap up rate-reset securities on the cheap with potential for 50%+ upside (or potentially 10% yield eventually). On the other, if things get even worse and trigger an even greater decline in rates into negative, this can go to $6 or even $5. I really want to believe that at some point, the selling will stop, and that there will be extreme value to be found here.

Adding to this: for people with low income and high net worth (retirees, people who inherited a lot of money, etc...) who live in Canada, assuming you are under 65, single and with no dependants and are not disabled, these eligible dividends mean the effective tax rate is 0% for the first $52 000 of income, 6.4% on the next $26 000, 8.9% on the next $10 000, and so on.

I am 28, and my fiancé is 26. We make about $115k per year before taxes. We reside in a low-cost-of-living state. I maxed out my Roth IRA last year and contributed an additional 3% of my income to a retirement account, Federal TSP, with 3% job matching. I returned about 24% last year. Fiancé currently makes no retirement contributions.

My portfolio allocation:  
G-Fund – Government Securities 1%  
F-Fund – Fixed Income Index 21%  
C-Fund – Common Stock Index 40%  
S-Fund – Small Cap Index 26%  
I-Fund – International Stock Index 5%  
As an aside, I feel like a corporate debt crisis is coming because so many companies hold treasury stock and if the markets crash, many firms will not be able to sell and become unable to pay their debts.

I have $46k in student loan debt. My job is about halfway through making a series of payments for a total of $10k to my student loans; this equates to about $770/month. We pay an additional $1,250/month towards them, too. So, we are at about $2,020/month.

Furthermore, we pay an additional $1,200/month in rent and have about $700/month in other fixed bills (utilities, insurance, and a stable grocery bill). We have some variable expenses of around $300-400/month. Neither of us makes a car payment.

So, about $3,450 goes out every month. We save the rest.

We have roughly $40,000 in our checking. My fiancé has an additional $8,000 in savings.  
My credit is not perfect at 680, but we are working on that, too. Made posts in the CRedit sub.  
Fiancé is at 780.

We want to buy a house soon. I feel trapped by debt and options, which makes me unsure of what to do and where to go next.

**I have a series of different questions:**  
Should we buy a house soon?

We are looking in the $220-250k range: Can we afford one?

Should we wait until the student loans are paid off fully? About two more years.

I want to buy a new $50,00 car. Should I do that?

Should I change my portfolio allocation based on current variations in the market?

When should we open a retirement account for my fiancé? We are waiting until after we buy a house currently.

Is my thought about the corporate debt crisis reasonable?

Any general advice is welcome!

investing,Yieldstreet is possibly a fraud,"I work in the financial services / investment management industry - and have been an investor in Yieldstreet (YS) since May 2018.  Based on my professional experience in investment management and personal experience as an investory in YS   - I believe YS shows many signs of being a fraud - of a few different kinds.

First kind - funky accounting.

I have invested 40k in 2 deals - which according to them have returned 10% annually. Except when I crunch the math based on the balances credited to the account to date - they have paid more like 4%.   


But that's not the worst part. 

Second kind - unreliable terms.  

Namely the investments do not mature as described. The first investment that I made in May 2018 had a stated term of 24 months. In March 2020 - almost 22 months later - that same investment has an ""estimated term remaining"" of 14 months. So somewhere in the interim - this investment went from 24 to 36 months. Now - when they made this change - they sent out reams of fine-print about this to cover their asses. But - to an investor in an illiquid and nonredeemable product where you have no choice but to accept these shenanigans - its basically a big ""fuck you"".  


But even this is not the worst part !  


Third kind - straight up good ol' fashion scam . 

The second investment I made was in their Louisiana Oil and Gas Financing deal. On paper this is what they show me :  


&gt; Current investment value: $21,413.35  
&gt;  
&gt;Principal Outstanding: $19,211.92  
&gt;  
&gt;Investment Interest Accrued: $2,201.43  
&gt;  
&gt;Target Interest Rate: 11.00%  
&gt;  
&gt;Estimated Term Remaining: 3 Mo.  


Except that this company **is bankrupt** and has not been making any payments what so ever and possibly will never pay back any portion of the principal. All these returns that they show on the website are pure fantasy.   And what about this bit : ""*Estimated Term Remaining : 3Mo*"" --- that's high comedy right there!   

More importantly - there has been no communication from Yieldstreet on this. At all. Total fucking silence. I've tried getting in touch with their support on multiple occasions - but have never heard back.

personalfinance,Car loan assistance for first time buyer,"Hello fellow redditors, 

So I have been researching on here for a while now on car loans. I recently applied for a car loan through my credit union. As a result, I was approved with an APR of 7.25%. I think that is a bit excessive as I have an excellent credit score. My credit union's reasoning for the high interest was because I have never financed and am a first time buyer. What should I do next? I thought credit unions were supposed to have the lowest interest rates.",finance

personalfinance,Leaving a job a like for less money...,"This is just my story about leaving my job.

I am a federal contractor, I have been for 12 years. I make great money, 135k a year. I have been in the cyber security field for almost 20 years and I am currently a penetration tester. I work 100% remote, very small team  with good benefits. 

 I've always wanted to go government and give back to our country as I never served. I'm the only male in my family that hasn't. 

A few months ago I applied for a federal position that is mostly compliance stuff. A little technical. But never really considered I would get it. Well I got a call last month for an interview. Thought it went well but who knows. About 3 weeks ago I got a tentative offer for 86k a year. Told them I couldn't do that and they came back with 118k. 

So I accepted that. Then after a week of thinking about it I decided my family couldn't afford a 17k cut. I let them know and they thanked me for my time and wished me luck. About an hour later they came back with 123k. So I agreed. 

My wife knows how much I wanted a fed job so she told me to take it and we'll be okay. It's not my dream job but it will do for now. Cheaper benefits, no stress over contracts every few years and I won't be treated like a contractor anymore. 

Am I crazy for giving up a job I like for a mediocre job , 12k less, but more stable?",finance
personalfinance,"(US) Tax break for buying first home, Does it have to be primary residence?","I am considering buying a property as the rates are so good right now. I am 31 and have always rented. I pay around 1900 for rent and utilities for a 3 bedroom apartment. We live in a desirable area, and condos, apt's and houses we look at are seeming to be instantly getting sold. Just saw a condo for 185k that has tenants in it paying 1500 a month. We're toying with the idea of buying the condo and staying put in our apartment and either moving in once the current tenants lease expires in July, or resigning them as tenants and using their rent income to pay that mortgage while we wait to see what the housing market is going to do and keep looking for our ""forever home"" or home that feels right. I feel rushed to make some sort of a purchase due to the fact that I was hit with 60k of federal income taxes, and although could probably afford to buy a larger home purchase and simply live in it, I am afraid due to current global climate and market uncertainties to make a larger purchase. In the scenario where I buy the condo and become a landlord, and still stay put in my current apt paying $1900/month, can I still deduct and receive benefits for purchasing the home, and start to gain equity using the tenants money to do so?

investing,"When do the major oil companies become ""buyable""","I'm not talking shale companies, but the Chevrons, Exxons, BPs, and Shells of the world.  I'm assuming the Saudi/Russia feud continues for 3-6 months, and US demand will likely drop some due to Covid-19 causing people to turtle up.  

For example, BP's dividend is now paying 10%.  Is that sustainable?  From what I can find online, they break even when oil is around $41/barrel.  It's below that now, but if they can weather through this likely short term feud, oil should come back up (possibly significantly if shale companies take a big hit).  There's the risk the majors would cut the dividend, but with interest rates so low they also seem more likely to borrow to cover the dividend until the worst is over.  If you can lock in a stock with a 10% dividend, then even if it stays at this level for a year or two, I'd consider it a win.",finance

Should I fill this form out entirely and apply ? 

And then also fill out a form elsewhere with someone like SOFI? 

Would that be okay on my credit? 

Also if I were to possibly get my dad as a co-signer on these loans would that give me an even better interest rate? 

I’m a little nervous about not getting approved but then again my credit rating is really great and I’ve never missed a payment on any of these loans or my credit car before. I’m assuming if I was approved for them they would give me so many days to accept or not so then I could compare the rates.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.

The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

financialindependence,"A Sudden, Shocking Retirement Surprise: A FIRE Journey","So on this subReddit, it seems that people are interested in the JOURNEY that others are on. This will be therapeutic to post, but here is my story (and I have anonymized and opened a brand-new Reddit account so I can be free with dollar figures):

I’m in my mid-50s, and have co-owned a California marketing and advertising business for 20+ years. Between 2005-2013 or so, we were raking in the money, and I was pretty good about saving that into a nice nest egg—with regular investments and a qualified benefit plan—that’s grown substantially. One year my earnings showed over $800k, and several years I was pushing $500k. For many years in a row, I never showed less than $300k on my tax forms.

Everyone’s career earnings fit into a bell curve, I think… and I have been on the tail-end of my bell curve over the last several years, with earnings dwindling every year. And then last year, due to the media consolidation in the business, our company lost both of our largest clients. Our company has since been dead in the water. We worked to replace those clients but despite some serious nibbles, we weren’t able to get any substantial new business. Out of desperation, I began applying to jobs with other companies, but I wasn’t able to command any serious interest in a new job in my field. I’m not sure why… ageism, competition, bad-looking resume. Not sure. For months, I have been staring down the end of my business, and maybe my career.

With one kid still to get through college, I have spent the last six months in a state of profound anxiety. My wife and I have been poring over our monthly expenses trying to reduce our monthly burn, cancelling subscriptions, cancelling our home land-line, re-doing insurance, begrudging every dollar spent while we painfully pulled money from our savings to cover our expenses. Sleepless nights, anxiety, a pit in my stomach all the time.

Then (here’s where it gets good), at the beginning of February, in a bit of desperation, I asked my financial planner to tell me what would happen if I retired NOW. I discovered that with a (pre-market crash) net worth of almost $7 million (including investments, stocks, property, house, benefit plan), we can withdraw north of $200k a year until we are 90. (That's only a bit less annually than I have taken home over the last couple of years.)

So I did it. I “retired.” I told the financial planner to switch on the retirement income. And I left my office.

I have always thought I wanted to work ’til I’m at least 60. I like to work, and I need to be busy. But when I made this sudden, shocking DISCOVERY — the epiphany — that I could retire at age 55 after a 30+-year career, a heavenly light went on, the clouds parted… seems like it’s what the believers talk about being “saved.” A HUGE weight lifted off me. The anxiety was gone. The struggle was gone. Amazing!

Now, for the last month and a half, I've consider myself “semi-retired.” I’m not chained to an office any more. I am hiking in the beautiful CA weather, upped my running mileage, working on creative projects, and planning travels with the wife. I’ve joined the coffee shop laptop crowd. I’m looking for freelance work, while lobbing job applications at things that look interesting, but if nothing happens, OH WELL. I am completely surprised by this turn of events! But for now, it feels FANTASTIC.

Nuts and bolts: Current monthly burn (hard expenses: insurance, mortgage, utilities, food, TV/phone/internet) is about $10k a month; when I get both my kids removed from our car, insurance, food, college expenses etc. within two years, that will be cut to about $6500/month. A $220k/year withdrawal taxed at capital gains rate of 15% “feels” like a $280k salary taxed at the normal federal and state rates in CA. No matter how much money a person makes, they think they would be more secure making more, but with my expenses, $220k/year is very sustainable, even in California. And considering the career brick wall I seem to have hit, it’s probably the best I will be able to do.

What can derail this? Oh, only a sudden GLOBAL MARKET CORONAVIRUS MELTDOWN. (Hold on, hold on... I have to believe we will come back.)

In the last few weeks, I have discovered this FIRE community. I've been reading your stores. I see people planning their lives around FIRE. I was never one of them. I never considered myself a retire-early guy, but here I am, and I am totally surprised and delighted by it. I need to make sure I have PURPOSE in my life with projects, travels, volunteer work. But right now, it feels VERY GOOD.

I hope by listing specific dollar amounts, this doesn’t come off as “braggy.” I'm not trying to flaunt my numbers. I want to talk through my journey, but a guy can’t share dollar amounts with his friends and family. Just with total strangers on the FIRE subReddit.",finance

The fed or other banking group who is anti-Bitcoin deliberately dumped a large amount of BTC at the same time as the stock market crash to create the illusion that they are massively correlated.

personalfinance,Mortgage Options With Renovations,"Hi everyone, my fiance and I are looking for a home by the end of the year or at least before our wedding in may next year. I was hoping to get some questions answered for some options we were thinking about. Since we would be co-signing, does that mean we may have better interest rates and higher loan ability?  

As for the real things I am worrying about is the house here in NJ. Really is not much for us here at our maximum of 440k. So we started toying of the idea of renovating a house that is around 250-300k. The company I work for has some perks with companies like Chase where they allow a 3.5% down payment as a first home owner loan but allow PMI to drop off after the 20% is reached. Not that we would put down the 3.5% only but I was curious on a few things with that. 

Is it smart to take out a 400-425k mortgage and use 100k plus towards reno? The whole loan would be that then, so even after reaching 20% of the house value, PMI would still be on due to it being tied to the loan right?  Is there a better option then doing that on the mortgage? 

We have time right now for a renovation so that's why we are toying with it. We have no idea if we can do it since we do have limit of maybe an hour away from NYC for a commute and dont know if we can find a home between that limit. 

Once the reno is complete, we were thinking refinancing would be a great start due to it most likely being by next year and both having raises would help us out. Is that also smart to do?  

In the end, is there a better option then getting a mortgage that's higher than the value of the house for reno or is it smarter to go another route so PMI is off with the money we put in?  Do we refinance after the renovation is complete?  

According to credit karma and turbo I have over a 730 credit score and she has over a 790 currently if that helps at all. 

Hope to get some educated answers, thank you all.",finance

investing,Beginners guide to the current market situation.,"**Is this normal?**

Yes and no. If you want to be a long term investor, you have to expect to go through some 5 or 6 recessions given [the frequency they happen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_recessions_in_the_United_States).

That said, every one of those recessions was unique/abnormal in some respect.

**Is this officially a recession?**

It's close to it, but the terminology is not as important as the question how long this will last and how bad it will get.

Edit: just to be clear - we'll only be able to tell in hindsight whether this is a recession. However, IMO we are the closest we have been to a recession in 10 years.

**So how bad is it going to get?**

Most companies will definitely feel a slowdown in the current quarter but that in and of itself would not be that bad. There are two possible factors that may make this recession much worse:

*  if the outbreak turns out to be worse than expected. At the moment there are examples of how the outbreak can be managed - notably Singapore has gotten it under control, the spread in China seems to be slowing and Germany seems to handle the outbreak well. However the situation may still change for the worse.
* if the economic strain on companies uncovers some extensive deeper problems (like the Great Recession of 2007-8 uncovered a lot of the banks' books being rotten). At this moment there are no reported issues showing this would be the case (businesses failing).

**Couldn't the current debt level of companies lead to a collapse?**

The debt volume is not new. There was a [steep rise in corporate debt between 1945 and 1970 and another spike in the 1990s](https://www.nber.org/papers/w19910). Current debt levels are not unusual especially considering historically low interest rates. If the interest rates should rise significantly a number of companies could run into trouble, but at the moment interest rates are decreasing.

Unless theres something more sinister hidden in corporate books this should not be a big problem.

**What about collapsing oil prices?**

Oil prices are a good indicator of somehting not working well within the economy. Here's the theory:

1. oil prices have droped unexpectedly
2. that means either demand for oil has fallen or some oil producer is flooding the market
3. if it's the demand it means less oil/fuel is being used
4. that means companies are producing and transporting less than expected
5. therefore there is an underlying problem in the industry/economy that needs to be addressed

In our current case however there's no mystery about what's causing the problem - it's the corona virus situation that is causing drops in oil demand. People are driving less, flying less and in some cases production has been halted because of it. In addition, Saudis are actually also flooding the market as a response to Russia's unwillingness to coordinate on reducing production.

So currently oil prices are not telling us anything new. As for impact on the economy - it's bad for oil producers but good for all companies doing any kind of logistics...

**Aren't the bond markets panicking/collapsing?**

No. [The last time the bond market crashed was in 1994](https://moneyweek.com/473408/heres-what-happened-the-last-time-the-bond-market-crashed) when the Fed raised the interest rates. You see, when you are holding treasuries and the Fed raises the interest rates, your treasuries are suddenly worth less. That's when people may panic-sell their treasuries and that's what has happened in 1994.  If on the other hand Fed lowers interest rates, treasury holders are happy to see the value of their holdings rise. People will be less likely to buy new treasuries because those have lower yield, but that's exactly the reason why Fed is lowering them.

**But aren't low interest rates a problem?**

It's not the rates themselves that causes problems. It's companies overstretching themselves on cheap loans. It's a slow process that may happen in the future if the interest rates stay low. If there are already companies that overloaded on debt and are running into insolvency territorry, we should see them in the news in the coming months. Right now the situation is quiet.

**Should I buy shares now?**

Depends on your strategy. As a beginner you should be running a long term dollar averaging ETF strategy and keep on buying in regular interval. Trying to guess the bottom would just be gambling for you.

I’m 23 and I live in [UT]

I’ve struggled with medical conditions all my life leading to me dropping out of high school at 15, getting my GED and enrolling in a “technical college” for HVAC at 16 (sometime around summer 2013) Super sketchy school, they lied about almost everything from “oh yes the buses run here at the times you’ll be coming to and from school” (they weren’t) to “yes we’ll help you get a job once you’re certified with us” (they *did not* certify students upon graduating, they only “supplied them with the knowledge they need to pass the EPA certification”) of course I didn’t know these things until after I signed my life away (my mother as well because I couldn’t legally sign on my own) 9 months into the 12 month program (literally all my class washed out expect me and three others due to us learning the school was a huge fraud essentially) I get extremely sick and need a relatively emergency surgery (one week to the next) so I got medical leave (filled out all the paper work and talked to the people I needed to) and was out of school for two to three months, when I’m finally well enough to go back I show up and *ALL* the staff has been replaced, not one single person is there from the front desk to the “school admin”. I sit down and explain I’m coming back from medical leave and they tell me they have no record of me, I say that’s bull shit as I was 9 months in there’s no way, after a week or two of arguing they decide to check my student loans and see that I indeed did *pay* for the course (I had to get a student loan for like 2k but grants and “scholarships” covered the other 28k) so they say look we’ll take you back but you have to start the course over, feeling defeated and not having anything else to do (mind you I’m still 16) I start but three months in I realize I can just take my epa test and don’t need the school so I resigned. 

I’ve been struggling off and on with my medical Conditions and 2018-2019 was the most I’ve ever been able to work consecutively. I’ve never been able to pay back the student loan until recently so every year they’d take my federal tax refund (yes all of it because I wasn’t making much) so In September 2019 I started getting in touch with my debtors and was trying to set up payments basically anything to take care of my debt in 2019. They would give me the run around, make me wait for emails and letters and return calls until late October they offer me a “rehabilitation program “ when I can pay whatever amount a month $5 min to get the debt active again essentially meaning it won’t be default status anymore I guess, so great I send them $5 and they say they’ll call again in a week or two to get more info to start the process. I wait.. and wait... and wait, until around late November I start calling them back almost every day and they’re giving me the run around again saying things like my payment never went through, (it did) they were waiting for employment verification (I was in between jobs and they knew this but I had money saved up) 

(Also during all this back and forth I eliminated other debts from debtors that we’re not playing hardball with me so it definitely was odd that they wouldn’t take my money)

December 2019 I get a new job so I get in touch with them and they say they’ll call me back blah blah blah, I end up in the hospital pretty much all December and most of January losing my new job and now I can’t work anymore due to a mix of problems but mainly kidney problems (kidney function below 10% needs to be removed)

They call me one day in February and I’m pissed at this point. I’m going off on them and they say “I see you started the program In October by sending $5 so let’s continue that now” at this point I’m just feeling defeated so I say whatever and start making payments again ($5/month)

Middle of February I’m filing my taxes and I realize that this rehabilitation program was supposed to take my loan out of default status meaning I wouldn’t have my taxes offset this year (first time ever).

Got my state income tax like two weeks ago but no fed so I call them and ask them, they’re giving me the run around but essentially saying they don’t have my money, so I figure okay it’s just taking a bit, I call the irs line and it tells me my taxes *are not* offset, so I’m like cool no worries. A week later still no fed, so I check the irs website and it says *my taxes have been applied to a previous debt* etc. so I’m pissed, I call debt collectors up and tell them to stop bullshitting me and he tells me that because we *just started the program in February it doesn’t count for this tax season* essentially I had to make *FIVE PAYMENTS FOR IT TO BE VALID* meaning if they would have let me pay this since October, I would have been fine.

I’m out of work, 1000+ miles away from any family, my fiancé is barely managing to keep us floating and a good friend is also helping me pay rent. I really needed that tax money, it isn’t a lot, but in my current situation that’s the difference from being out on the street or not. 

My question is, is there any way I can fight this? The debt is just on the cusp of being 7 years old but I’m pretty sure every time it’s sold off the timer resets or if they add interest (which they have every month since 2013) I’m pretty sure that my tax money is gone, but I feel like I’ve been cheated, I had a good paying job, I was willing to make 200-300 dollar payments every week (but not the full amount in one go like they wanted) if they would’ve just not gave me the run around back in October. 

I just got a letter in the mail today saying the rehabilitation is put “on hold” until they can “gather more information” about my income, I’ve already sent them everything, signed everything stating that I have 0 income. 

My credit is shit (I recently brought it from 350 to 600 is what it’s at now but shit like this makes it feel pointless), I’m broke, I’m seriously considering filing bankruptcy *before* me and my fiancé get married. 

**TL;DR I feel the debt collectors of my defaulted student loans from 2013 intentionally kept me from paying off my debt just so they could take my taxes, I’m now unable to work due to a severe medical issue and needed that money.
 Is there anything I can do to fight them or am I just screwed?**

Edit: I forgot to mention the original debt was secured through the department of education while I was 16 years old, living in Texas. I’m now 23 living in Utah.",finance

personalfinance,Dividend Stocks,"Hi All,  I recently saw a post asking about dividend stocks and the response was that a Total Market portfolio gave a higher yield.  I'd like to point out an attribute of dividend income I was unaware of that may benefit others.

When I began working, 1980, I opened an IRA and contributed when I could.  When employers started offering 401Ks I took advantage of that.  I've never had children and have a simple lifestyle, so I usually had other investment monies available .   Over the years I ended up with a taxable portfolio of mostly blue-chip dividend stocks.  Buy and hold - reinvest.  This was good for me because it avoided the capital gain tax hit of mutual funds in a taxable account.  

When I retired in 2014, I turned off the reinvest in my brokerage account and that became my income.  In round numbers it's about $40000/yr and relatively stable averaging +3.2% over 5yrs.

What I didn't know was that I wouldn't owe any Federal Income tax.  

The bulk of my dividends are qualified which are taxed at a lower rate than other personal income; 0% up to about $39000 in 2019.  Perhaps this is old news to the more astute among us, but it was new to me.  ;-)

Interesting anecdote...  I had been sending estimated payments.  When doing my taxes the first year of my retirement, using the Qualified dividends tax worksheet, I kept coming up with $0.  I couldn't find a mistake but it didn't seem right so I sent in a payment based on my AGI. The next year I received a letter asking for a meeting at my local IRS office.  :-0  The very nice lady explained to me that in fact I didn't owe tax and wrote me a check for my estimated payments in addition to what I had sent at tax time.  Since then I don't make Federal estimated payments.

I'm not making a case for everyone to start buying dividend stocks, but this was a benefit I was unaware of.",finance

&amp;nbsp;

And for those too lazy to click on the University of Chicago Med [resource](https://www.uchicagomedicine.org/forefront/prevention-and-screening-articles/wuhan-coronavirus), here are some of the answers to commonly asked questions:

&amp;nbsp;

**What is a coronavirus? What is a novel coronavirus?**

&gt; A coronavirus is actually the name for a set of illnesses, including the common cold and other respiratory infections. A novel coronavirus means it’s a new virus that originated in animals, but has jumped to humans. This particular 2019 novel coronavirus from Wuhan is called COVID-19 or 2019-nCoV.

&amp;nbsp;

**How does the COVID-19 spread?**

&gt; This virus is really transmissible and can spread easily from person to person even before a person develops symptoms. It’s carried on respiratory droplets when we talk, sneeze, and cough and these can land on surfaces or in someone’s mouth or nose.  When it comes to respiratory droplets, 6 feet is the magic distance. That’s how far these tiny, infected droplets can travel.  Being within 6 feet of someone who is sick can get you or your personal space contaminated with COVID-19.  

&gt; When droplets land on surfaces, we can pick them up with our hands and transfer them to our eyes, mouth, and nose when we touch our faces. This is why hand hygiene is so important.  Respiratory secretions (like snot and sputum) are also infectious so cover your coughs and sneezes.


&amp;nbsp;

**What are the symptoms of the virus? Is it deadly?** 

&gt; It typically causes flu-like symptoms. Some patients — particularly the elderly and others with other chronic health conditions — develop a severe form of pneumonia.

&gt; Patients develop symptoms like fever, muscle and body aches, cough, and sore throat about 5-6 days after infection. Most people will feel pretty miserable for a week and get better on their own.  Some people won’t get as sick, but it’s still important not to be out and about, so as not to spread the disease.  A minority of patients will get worse instead of better. This usually happens after 5-7 days of illness and these patients will have more shortness of breath and worsening cough.  If this happens, it’s time to contact your doctor again or even go to an emergency room. Be sure to call first so they know you are coming.  

&gt; The numbers of people who have been diagnosed and how many have died are changing daily. As of early March, there have been over 97,000 confirmed cases, with a death toll of about 3,000 (more than 2,900 in mainland China). But these numbers are just estimates; it’s still unclear how many people have actually been infected worldwide. Most of the deaths have been in adults over 60 years old who had other health concerns.

&amp;nbsp;

**Are we all at risk for catching this new coronavirus (2019-nCoV)?**

&gt; Yes. It doesn’t appear anyone is naturally immune to this particular virus and there’s no reason to believe anybody has antibodies that would normally protect them. 

&gt; The lack of previous experience with this pathogen is part of the reason why public health officials around the globe are working so hard to contain the spread of this particular coronavirus from Wuhan. When viruses come out like this that are both new (which means the population is highly susceptible) and can easily pass from person to person (a high transmission rate), they can be really dangerous — even if here’s a low percentage of people who die from them. 

&amp;nbsp;

**Why do some people with the COVID-19 get sicker than others?**

&gt; It looks like only about 20% of people who contract this novel coronavirus need to be hospitalized. The other 80% get what feels like a bad cold and recover at home. A lot of this has to do with underlying medical conditions. People who are more vulnerable to any kind of infection — because of their age or chronic health conditions — are more at risk for getting really sick from COVID-19. 

&gt; That said, some otherwise healthy people do seem to be getting sicker from this infection than we would expect. We don’t understand why that is or what might be different about these patients. If you have COVID-19 and you are getting sicker and sicker instead of better and better, you should contact your doctor or visit an ER. Be sure to call first so they know to expect you.  

&amp;nbsp;

**What kind of medical care do patients with COVID-19 need?**

&gt; About 80% of people who contract this new coronavirus will feel sick, but ultimately be just fine. It’s the 20% of COVID-19 patients who get really, really sick that worry many of us in the infectious diseases field. A lot of these critically ill patients wind up needing to be hospitalized for their pneumonia-like illnesses. They typically require critical care and ventilation — special machines that help them breathe. And some need to stay on ventilators for weeks at a time. It’s this portion of patients that is most concerning. Depending on how many cases develop here in the U.S., providing that level of care for so many people over a number of weeks runs the risk of overwhelming the nation’s health care system pretty quickly. We can help prevent this kind of “surge” in patients by practicing social distancing (see below for more explanation). 

&amp;nbsp;

**Should people be more concerned about the seasonal flu or COVID-19?**
 
&gt; There’s widespread seasonal flu activity going on right now all around the U.S.  But there are steps you can take to protect yourself from influenza. You can get an annual flu shot. You can take medication like Tamiflu that protects you from getting influenza after you’ve been exposed. You can cover your mouth and wash your hands to mitigate the spread. And, like clockwork, this year’s influenza strain is going to die out in the spring because it will have run its course. 

&gt; The challenge with COVID-19 is that we probably can’t contain it and we don’t know if we’re really prepared as a country for a massive coronavirus epidemic.  If we are lucky, it will slow down a bit over the summer but the next few months look like they are going to be pretty tough for all of us. We need to be as ready as we can for whatever comes our way and know that we will get through it eventually. 

&amp;nbsp;

**How can I protect myself?  Should I wear a facemask?**
  
&gt; Take the preventive actions you do for the cold and flu. This includes avoiding close contact with people who are sick; not touching your eyes, nose and mouth; washing your hands thoroughly and frequently; and cleaning and disinfecting objects and surfaces you come in contact with regularly.

&gt; The CDC does not recommend you wear a facemask to protect yourself from getting COVID-19 or other respiratory illnesses. Those who have COVID-19 and/or are showing symptoms should wear a mask to protect others from getting the virus.  Any healthcare worker taking care of someone infected with COVID-19 also should wear a mask.

&amp;nbsp;

**Can I take an antibiotic or vaccinate against the virus?**
 
&gt; There is no antibiotic (they are designed for bacterial infections, not viral ones) to treat COVID-19.  Scientists are already working on a vaccine, but we don’t expect to have a good vaccine until spring of 2021 at the earliest.  However, ongoing trials in China suggest that there are some existing antiviral drugs that may be helpful for the sickest patients.  In fact, the University of Chicago is part of a multi-institutional team that has mapped a protein of SARS-CoV-2 and found drugs previously in development for SARS could be effective for COVID-19.

&gt; For now, doctors can only treat the symptoms, not the virus itself.",finance
personalfinance,Right time to buy a home?,"My wife and I have been saving for the past two years to buy a house this Spring-Summer but we are finding even with the low interest rates homes seem to be overvalued in the NJ-NY area.  Due to the inventory shortage homes seem to be going contingent as fast as 72 hours and getting a house at asking seems hard since on average houses are selling 3% (as per Redfin) above asking and I have seen many sell 5%+ above.    


Looking deeper into this it seems like we are at peak market value and with US banks struggling and a possible global recession is it worth holding back on buying a place until after November or even until 2021?    


The good news is that my landlord said we can continue renting from her after our lease is up at the end of June month and go month.  With parking our rent is 18% of our take home pay after taxes, which will allow us to keep on saving at a pretty good rate.",finance
personalfinance,Retirement Savings Plan Check,"I put together a plan that I think makes sense, but it's fairly different than what I'm doing right now and just wanted to make sure I'm not overlooking anything that could come back to bite me.

Details: No debt other than mortgage, 3 years into a 30 year mortgage, 4.5% interest rate (looking at refinancing but not sure how much longer we'll be in this house so holding off on for now). Have a 6 month emergency fund built up. Largest expenditures are $1800/mo childcare and $1500/mortgage. Total expenditures/month average out to $8k over the last 12 months. We've maxed 2019 and 2020 IRAs. Wife contributes to a pension, has a 403b plan available but doesn't contribute. Husband contributes 4% (for company match) to a 401k.

So working backwards from income:  
Wife Monthly Paycheck = $3333

After pension = $3010

After 403b (52.5% of paycheck to max) = $1427

After Taxes (Assuming 25% effective tax rate) = $1070

Wife Yearly Take Home = $1070\*12=$12,480

Husband Bi Weekly Paycheck = $4669

After 401k (13.5% of paycheck to max, get a 2% employer match for total 15.5%) = $4032

After Pre Tax Deductions (Medical, Vision, Dentist) = $3819

After Taxes (Assuming 25% effective tax rate) = $2863

After Post Tax Deductions (Legal plan, life insurance) = $2843

Husband Yearly Take Home = $2843\*26= $73,918

Household Yearly Take Home = $73,918+$12,480=$86,398

RSUs that vest in 2020, assuming 50% taxes = $37,500

Total Household Income = $37,500+$86,398= $123,899

Yearly Expenses = $8,000\*12=$96,000

Yearly Buffer = $123,899-$96,000=$27,898  


In future years, we'd contribute $12k of that to our IRAs, leaving us with $15k/yr buffer. I tried to estimate on the safe side for tax rates. So a couple of questions.

1) Am I missing anything obvious here?

2) With a $15k/yr buffer, what should I be looking to do with it pending it's not actually used somewhere throughout the year? We don't have any big purchases coming up soon, cars are paid off and only a few years old. We do have two children @ 13 months. We were thinking about using our IRA contributions as a college fund eventually for them, but maybe we should contribute to a 529 instead with the buffer? Husband has an HSA available that we could contribute to. What else should we look at?",finance

personalfinance,Interest high on auto loan due to how small the loan is? Normal?,"Hi! My car finally gave it up and I've been looking at buying a car. I've fallen in love with a 1997 BMW Z3 with 88k miles on it for $5k. Unfortunately, I don't have the money outright so I will have to finance it. It can only be financed up to 42 months due to the age of the car (totally understandable, wouldn't want to pay on it more than 3 years or so - I have a 5 mile round trip commute so I won't be driving it a ton or anything). Due to how small the loan is, the lender said it will be 17% interest, and it's usually 29% for such a small loan, but due to my 755 credit score, they managed to get it down to 17%. I also struggled with similar at another dealership - tried to get a Scion xD for $5k but they wouldn't even finance at all under $7k. I can afford the monthly and the car insurance without issue, but I also don't want to be spending more than I should on this car.

As much as I'm in love with the car, I'm almost wondering if I'd be better off just getting a newer, more expensive car since my interest rate will be so darn high with the Z3 (or any other small loan car, apparently).

(edit: one thing to note is that the z3 was my cheapest insurance quote I could get at $45 a month for comprehensive. Most other, newer cars were pushing $70, so that factors into the affordability for me.)",finance
gaming,Anyone else feeling fed up with competitive shooters? I think I know why.,"I have just about given up shooters. It's a brilliant genre that has given me lots of entertainment. I've been a big fan of Battlefield since 2005, after Battlefield V flopped I turned my eyes to PUBG. After PUBG lost it to hackers I started playing Escape from Tarkov. Cheaters are destroying that game as well, and right now CoD Modern Warfare and the new battle royale mode is my last resort. But looking back I figure MW has maybe a month still until it's cracked to pieces. Already there are lots of videos of people using aim bots.

I think there are at least two kinds of hackers. One type that do it for trolling/boost ego. And another type that do it as a livelihood. The second category are the same people that sell gold in various MMO's

The FPS genre has not been very interesting for gold sellers historically. You haven't been able to sell anything since FPS games traditionally have been about results rather than equipment

Now that a lot of FPS games have implemented player markets the good sellers are looking for ways to exploit this new market.

FPS games are more sensitive to hackers than the MMO genre since more information is stored client side. As so it is accessible to cheating software.

Steam marketplace and other forms of trading items for real money gives these people a massive incentive for cheating. I don't even know if cheating is the right word for it. These people are at work cracking games for food.

The first group of cheaters, the entitled group who do it for their ego, is also growing. But for another reason that happens to tie in to this pretty well. As people spend more and more time on games, developers have to put in rewards that require increasingly ridiculous accomplishments. The rewards on your ego in form of bragging equipment is bigger than ever before.

I hope developers and publishers soon take their hands of their money machines and start asking themselves questions like:

Do we need a player economy?

Do we need extra chromed deluxe skins that require around 1000 hrs of playtime or mtx?

Do we believe enough in our product to let it sit for 6 months without any extra content? And if we don't, why do we consider it ready to ship?

We probably won't rid the genre of cheaters completely, but we would be able to make this problem way less severe.

What do you think, is this a problem we can solve?",technology

personalfinance,Refinancing our new home a good idea?,"Okay so we just locked in a rate with Quicken Loans and im getting ready to sign all of the paperwork. I want to hear from you guys if you feel like we did the right thing.

&amp;#x200B;

We built the house new last year and closed in October. The house was 357k at closing, we closed at a 3.75% interest rate. Our payments were 1869 - 227 for escrow = $1,642. This is a VA loan and i'm exempt from the funding fee!

&amp;#x200B;

Okay now we are looking to refi because of the market dropping to low rates. I have a good credit score and I was confident I could get a lower rate. We got estimates from several lenders, a couple internet lenders and my local credit union. It seems the estimate from Quicken Loans might be the best deal overall. They are offering a 2.75% interest rate, which drops our payment to 1,446.20 without escrow. Our closing costs come out to $6,246. Of that $6,246, there is $3,500 in points and a -$2,000 lender credit which brings our total closing cost to about $4,200. Give or take some that will drop off like the $500 appraisal fee, they highballed the escrow payment at closing, etc. The total balance on the home is still 350k. 

I'm not sure how to do the math or how to determine if this is a good deal and how long we'll need to be in the house to cover the cost of points. They gave us the lender credit to try and reduce the burden of paying 3,500 in points and to ensure we didn't need cash to close.",finance

personalfinance,"Racked up $25k in CC Debt... Paying it off is possible, but I'm barely treading water.","TLDR: Untreated Bipolar Mania led to 25k debt, I make a decent amount but can barely afford to pay bills. What can I do?

So when I first graduated college, I moved into an apartment near my new job/career, and it was my first time living alone. I had never paid rent/utilities/etc before, as I always lived with my parents or in a dorm. 

Living alone was super dangerous for me, and I did not know it. My mental state rapidly deteriorated, and after struggling financially making $45k in a big city, I just said ""fuck it, I'll do whatever I want and worry about it later"". $25k in high-interest CC debt accumulated in about 3 months, and when my mental state hit rock bottom, I moved in with friends. I've since recovered and am receiving treatment for my Bipolar (which was undiagnosed when I lived alone), and would consider myself in a very stable mental state now. 

I've made a sizable dent in the debt, and have lowered it to $18k over the course of 3 years. Things have changed since accumulating the debt, and I now make significantly more, but I'm still struggling with minimums. I took a lot of the debt and put it into consolidation loans with significantly lower interest rates, and have shredded all 12 of my cards. There are now only four accounts left with balances:

 * Discover: $629.50, 19.49% APY, Min. Payment $35
 * Barclays: $2404.09, 13.49% APY, Min. Payment $65
 * Loan #1: $5144.19, 14.64% APY, Min. Payment $294.91, 20 Payments Left
 * Loan #2: $8139.18, 11.19% APY, Min. Payment $275.75, 34 Payments Left

Total of Minimum Payments: $670.66

I know these interest rates sound horrid, but they're a hell of a lot better than the 45%-65% rates of the original cards. It felt good to shred those.

I get a paycheck of $1500 every two weeks, so I usually get $3000 every month. It's actually a little more than $1500, but I have the extra ~$80 going to an emergency savings account that I cannot touch. My monthly expenses (car, rent, etc) not including the debt is historically [$1785.37](https://i.redd.it/891tk2ucr5q01.jpg) 

So, making nothing but minimum payments, my monthly expenses are $2456.03. This does not include food, savings, or anything not an immediate concrete obligation. $543.97‬ spread out over a month for emergencies, food, medication, etc. is pretty tight, if I'm being honest. Making nothing but the minimum payments will take 11 years to pay off. No bueno. 

My ultimate goal is to pay off all of the debt by the end of January 2022. I did some calculating, and if I use the Snowball method with an additional $250 per month, I can have everything paid off in 21 months; right on target. So, new math:

 * New loan monthly total: $920.66
 * Other obligations: $1785.37
 * Total: $2706.03
 * Leftover: $293.97

***YIKES***. Less than $300 for an entire month, for 21 months. 

So my question is: Is there any way I can pay off my debt by my goal without starving? I've gotten everything to the lowest rates I can get....


***EDIT:***

More information as requested:

 * Pay is salary, not eligible for overtime
 * Car payment is 375. Car is worth 18k, I owe 21k on it.
 * I have never missed a payment on any card, loan, or payment
 * Credit score is 718",finance
CryptoCurrency,"Recession, Bitcoin, and the Central Banks.","The prospect of a recession in the US and Europe is being priced in to markets everywhere. Some countries are already in the midst of financial chaos—think Venezuela, Argentina, Turkey. As is usual in the face of such worries, the gold price has lifted. So has Bitcoin—up substantially in recent months. 

Bitcoin critics are numerous, and have long been vocal in their claims that the project is criminal, or will fail, or that it offers no lasting value. Despite this, the market remains robust, and the Bitcoin blockchain has performed perfectly since its inception over ten years ago. New features to improve access, utility, and performance are continually being developed, and this track record, along with the blockchain’s complete transparency, is an effective recruiting sergeant. The network metrics show that Bitcoin is increasingly popular. Several large financial corporations now offer their clients exposure to Bitcoin through custody as well as derivatives. In light of future financial uncertainty, most commentators expect further value flows into cryptos, and especially Bitcoin, which enjoys the majority of the sector’s liquidity and capital value.

With discussions about Facebook’s Project Libra still in the news, we are at the point where central banks are now considering how to respond to the advent of natively digital money. Whether the banks tokenize their own currencies directly, or adopt a mutual coin—perhaps in concert with other central banks or through the IMF—it seems certain that within a few years millions of people will be interacting with the financial system through programmable money rather than the “dumb” fiat we’ve all been using for centuries (and which will certainly continue for some time yet). There will be numerous problems to overcome, to be sure, (for instance, many of the profit centers of commercial banks are obviated by crypto and so-called De-Fi [de-centralized finance] at a stroke, so such a momentous move must be carefully planned), but the advantages and efficiencies are substantial—too great to ignore. 

Switching to a digital currency regime does throw up some interesting issues. 

For example, at present, very few ordinary people do any “carry trading”—where you borrow in one currency to invest in another. The exchange rate risks are obvious and you have to be on your toes. But anyone using a tokenized currency can easily swap their depreciating national-currency tokens for another kind that is scarcer and which appreciates. This means that people could keep their wealth in a coin that appreciates (e.g. Bitcoin), and spend in their local currency (euros, dollars, etc, that depreciate) with their wallet making the required exchanges on the fly (if exchange is even necessary—many merchants will simply accept the appreciating currency). In other words, sovereign digital currencies that lose 2% of their buying power every year (as they are deliberately engineered to do, to keep people spending) will inevitably be exchanged for money that is deflationary. And because the costs of doing so will be close to zero, and users’ wallets can make any necessary exchanges on the fly, the risk of loss due to exchange fluctuation is also close to zero. 

There are other questions that digital currencies throw up, such as how central banks avoid putting retail banks out of business. Doubtless the Game Theorists are having a ball.

The adoption or introduction of digital currency will mean that the existing monetary policies of many sovereigns will have to be modified—and will surely have to be much more aligned with each other. The standard 2% inflation target, for example, will almost certainly have to be dropped. Seigniorage by commercial banks will no longer be possible in the conventional way. The implications for structural debt are obvious and alarming. A traditionally depreciating currency shrinks debt. A currency that is appreciating in value makes old debt more expensive as time goes by. 

In short, governments are likely to be extremely cautious about adopting digital currencies, because although the advantages are substantial, the potential downsides are also severe. The debate about whether and to what extent private institutions should be allowed to determine monetary policy or control the money supply will intensify. The chances of any government ceding control of these economic levers to private hands look extremely unlikely in the current landscape. 

So for the coming few years at least, Bitcoin will be the go-to coin for people wishing to hold some of their wealth in a digital token. There is the possibility that one or more central banks will begin to hold some BTC as part of their reserves. This would obviously have a large effect on the market, so any such measures would probably be undertaken gradually and secretly. There are good reasons why central banks—probably acting in concert—would buy BTC, not least to allow them to control this vital component of what will be a large digital currency market in the future. Moreover, purchasing a controlling fraction (which would be much less than 50% of the available coins) now would be a relatively trivial expense (perhaps 50 billion USD spread across 20 central banks). Doing it in 5 years might not (&gt;500 billion USD). This possibility alone is a good reason to hold a few BTC.",cryptocurrency

investing,"Options Basics: Intro to Puts, Calls, and the Volatility of the Underlying Asset","**Before You Read:** This is part of an ongoing series on the basics of options trading and valuation, focusing on stock options. This is the second post in the series. You do not need to read the first part for this part to make sense, but if you are not familiar with the concept of equity, you may find it helpful.

The first post, which goes over the concept of equity, can be found here:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/fdx8tw/options\_basics\_what\_is\_equity\_and\_why\_should\_i/](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/fdx8tw/options_basics_what_is_equity_and_why_should_i/)

This post will explain what put and call options are. From there, it will delve into our first valuation and trading concept, which has to do with volatility as the title suggests. There is an opportunity to apply your knowledge at the end.

This is a bit of a long post because it introduces a lot of new concepts. I will try to make subsequent posts shorter. I suggest taking a break and coming back to this post later if you start to get tired or confused. You can take this in bites, so no need to swallow it like a snake.

**Puts and Calls**

**A put is the right, but not the obligation, to sell an asset for a specific price.** The asset the put holder has a right to sell is called the **“underlying.”** The price at which the put option allows the option holder to sell is called the **“strike.”** Put options have an **expiration date**, after which they cannot be exercised, which is to say you owner of the put option can no longer invoke their right to sell after the option has expired. Now, let’s put it all together into once sentence: **When a person trades a put option, they are trading the right to sell the underlying at the strike price, subject to the eventual expiration.** 

That sounds great, but how could the right to sell something at a certain price be valuable? At this point, you need to have a notion of what “market price” means. Let’s review for a moment before we dive in, using stocks as an example. When you trade a stock, you buy or sell that stock based on an agreed upon price. Traders can bid (offer to purchase) or “ask” (offer to sell) a stock at any price, but only when one trader’s bid to buy is higher than another trader’s ask to sell does a trade actually occur. That point of overlap is called the “market price.” In reality, the bid involved will end up being slightly higher than the ask, and a series of financial institutions ultimately make their money by pocketing the difference, but for our purposes, we’ll say that the market price is just where bids and asks collide. For our purposes, we may also refer to the market price as the “spot price” for now. Either term is fine for the moment.

**Puts have value because the strike price of a put may be different than the market price of the underlying.** For example, if you own a put with a strike of $5, and the underlying has a market price of $3, you have the right to buy the underlying for $3, and then turn around and exercise that put to sell the underlying to collect $5, ultimately making $2 of profit. That $2 is called the “intrinsic value” of the put option. **The intrinsic value of an option is how much you could theoretically profit at a given moment if you exercise it.**

Here is another way to look at intrinsic value: at the very moment when the option is just about to expire, and there is not enough time for the underlying price to change before expiration, the option would be worth $2. In other words, the option holder could theoretically sell their option and collect $2 instead of exercising it. Why an option holder might choose to sell rather than exercise an option will become clear as you read this series. What it comes down to is that the amount you can sell an option for may be greater than the amount you could stand to profit by exercising it. In other words, **an option may be worth more than its intrinsic value except at the exact moment of expiration**; just how is discussed later in this post.

For now though, it’s alright to be content with the notion that put options have value and that an option holder may choose to sell a put option rather than exercise it. Remember, the definition; a put is “the right, but *not* the obligation” to sell.

Now, let’s define call options, using what we have learned about puts: **A call option is the right, but not the obligation to buy (not sell) an underlying asset at a strike price, subject to expiration.** It should come as little surprise that call options also have value for reasons similar to put options. See for yourself. **Question 1:** if you had a call option with a strike of $5, and the underlying had a market price of $10, how much could you profit by exercising your call option to buy the underlying and then turning around and selling the underlying on the market? I’ll put the answer at the end of this post.

**Remember, calls let you buy at the strike. Puts let you sell at the strike.**

Like put options, call options can be traded, their intrinsic value is based on the difference between the strike price and the market price of the underlying, and they may be worth more than their intrinsic value except at the moment they expire. 

Let’s recap: puts are a right to sell, and calls are a right to buy. One good way to remember it is to imagine the underlying were a dog; if you call the dog, it will come to you. Puts and calls can both be exercised or traded. The option holder gets to decide if they want to exercise or trade, but the option can’t be exercised after it expires. Depending on the price of the underlying, exercising can lead to profits, and that possibility is why options have value.

We will now go over what can cause an option to trade for more than its intrinsic value. There are a few variables that can affect options valuation. We have mentioned two so far; 1) the strike price of the option and 2) the market price of the underlying. Volatility is the first one we will go over (later in this post) because it is the easiest to understand given only the strike and the spot. In future posts, we will go over the role of the time left until expiration and the role of prevailing interest rates; specifically something called the “riskless rate,” or “rf” for short. There are other variables that can be incorporated into options pricing models, but we will not address them until we have gone over at least two models that deal with these first five. 

To be clear, we are building up to being able to use 2 models that both incorporate five key variables, and you’ll be able to use 3 of the variables a simplified version of one of the two models by the end of this post. The key variables are, as previously stated:

1. The strike of the option, which we will call “K”

2. The market price of the underlying, which we will call “S.” S stands for “spot,” which for now we will just say is another name for the market price.

3. The volatility of the spot price

4. The time left until the option expires

5. The “riskless rate” briefly mentioned above

K and S determine intrinsic value. The other variables deal more with what we call “time value.”

**Intrinsic Value versus Time Value**

Let’s consider a call option with a strike of $8 (K=$8). Let’s say the market price or spot price is $9 (S = $9). If you were to exercise at that moment, you would make exactly $1 in profit (intrinsic value = $1 because $9 - $8 = $1). This uses the same logic we went over above. If you don’t get it, try doing Question 1, asking for help in the comments, or DMing me. 

But what if we knew that the price of the underlying (S) could change? For simplicity’s sake, we’ll assume for now that S can change exactly once before expiration. We’ll also assume that, when S does change, it will change to either $6 (go down by $3) or $12 (go up by $3), and there is a 50% chance of each of those possible changes happening. Finally, we’ll assume that the change is about to occur this instant, so no time will pass before the single change, and the change will happen instantly. This is a lot to assume, but the assumptions will become less ridiculous as we are variables to our model.

If S goes to $12, intrinsic value would become $4 because $12 - $8 = $4. If S goes down to $6, the call is worth $0. Why is it not worth $-2? Remember, a call option is the right, but **not the obligation** to buy the underlying at the strike, so the option holder does not need to buy the underlying for $8 when the spot price is at $6; they can just decide not to exercise the option and let it expire worthless. 

Let’s recap: There is a 50% change the option will be worth $4 at expiration and a 50% chance it will be worth $0 at expiration. The option has $1 of intrinsic value right now. It also has what practitioners call “time value,” which is the value of the chance of the option having intrinsic value later. This time value is not to be confused with “the time value of money” which is a different concept. 

Let’s see how much time value this option has, starting with the single most important fact about option valuation: **The total value of an option is a function of its probability weighted future payoffs.** In this case, to find that total value, you multiply the value of each outcome by the likelihood it will happen. 50%\*$4 + 50%\*$0 = $2, so the total value of the option is $2. Subtract the intrinsic value of $1 from the total value, and you get $1 of time value. 

Before we do another example, this time with a put option, let’s quickly examine why it is worth breaking out the value of an option into intrinsic value versus time value. As I implied, **total option value = time value + intrinsic value**, and intrinsic value is S-K (spot – strike) for a call option and K-S (strike – spot) for a put option. You may recall I said that the one time an option’s total value is equal to its intrinsic value is at the moment of expiration because the underlying spot price has no time left to change. The implication here is that if total value approximates intrinsic value as the option nears expiration, then time value ultimately decreases to $0. Describing mathematically how the time value changes over time and eventually gets to $0 will require all five variables in either of our models – so that’s something to look forward to. For now, just be aware that this feature of options valuation exists. 

Let’s take the simplified model we have already used to value a call and apply it to value a put option. I’m going to start using the variables without restating what they mean at this point. You will want to be comfortable with them by the time we get to a full model.

Consider this put: K=7. S=10. The spot can either become $3 or $17 using the same assumptions about changes in the spot that we made for the call option valuation above. Let’s check out the total valuation first. If the price goes down to $3, it will be $4 below K, so intrinsic value would be $4. If the price of the stock goes up to $17, the intrinsic value of the option would be $0 because $17&gt;$7. Now, let’s add it up: 50%\*$4 + 50%\*$0 = $2, so the option is worth $2. How much of that is intrinsic value? Well, S&gt;K to start with, so the option starts with no intrinsic value. Therefore, all $2 are from time value. 

A little more terminology before we continue. **The relationship between a strike price and a spot price is called “moneyness.”** Remember how intrinsic value was $0 when the strike was below the spot for a put or above the spot for a call? **Intrinsic value cannot be negative, but moneyness can**. So a call with S = $3 and K = $5 would have a moneyness of $-2. If moneyness is positive, an option is said to be “in the money” or “ITM.” If you’re familiar with the musical *42nd Street*, you can remember this because being in the money is a very good thing. If moneyness is negative, the option is “out of the money”  
  or “OTM.” If moneyness is exactly $0, the option is “at the money” or “ATM.” This terminology will come in handy later when we start talking about actual trades. Let’s test our knowledge so far:

**Question 2:** An option has a moneyness of $-2 and S&gt;K. Is it a call or a put? Answer shown at end of post. Can the option still be worth more than $0? How much of that value would be intrinsic value versus time value?

The relationship between moneyness and intrinsic value results in a special relationship between total option value and the spot price of the underlying.

Thank you for staying with me so far by the way. I know this is a lot.

**Volatility and Option Value**

You may have already noticed that an option’s intrinsic value can be expressed as a function of moneyness. Namely, if moneyness is at least 0, then intrinsic value = moneyness. This idea is powerful because it applies to both puts and calls. 

Now consider that if moneyness is not greater than 0, intrinsic value does not change as moneyness decreases further because it just stays at 0. In other words, whether moneyness is -3 or -10,000, intrinsic value is 0. However, if moneyness is at least 0, then as moneyness increases, intrinsic value increases as we stated before. If we put these two ideas together, we see that **the relationship between moneyness and intrinsic value is asymmetrical around 0. In other words, options have an asymmetric payoff function.**

Now let’s think of this in terms of volatility: all else being equal, a more volatile underlying asset price has more potential to cause an option to expire further in the money or further out of the money. Another way of saying this is that greater volatility leads to a greater chance of a higher absolute value of moneyness at expiration. Since intrinsic value can’t get any lower once it hits 0, higher volatility can raise the maximum intrinsic value an option can have at expiration up to infinity, but cannot lower the minimum intrinsic value below 0. So, under the model we have been using, if an option can already end up with $0 of intrinsic value, volatility can only help option value, not hurt it, from there. Later, when we get to the Black Scholes model, we will see that volatility is virtually always is accretive to total option value, but for now we will stick to easy examples where options have a high potential to expire OTM. 

For the purposes of an example, we’ll introduce one new term; σ (pronounced “sigma”). σ a parameter used to express volatility. Some readers may notice that σ is used to denote standard deviation in statistics. The idea is similar here. For this model, σ will denote the amount by which S can move up or down during the single change that occurs before option expiration. So if S is 0 to start with and can move to 4 or -4, then σ = 4. **Later on, we will express σ as a %, indicating a rate of change, but we are keeping it simple for now.**

Consider a call option with the following parameters using the model we have been using so far: K=25, S=20, σ=10. We know S can end up being either 30 (20+10) or 10 (20-10), which means the intrinsic value of the call will be either 5 (30-25) or 0 (because 10&lt;25), which means that value of the option now is 2.5. 

Now let’s try decreasing sigma to 7. Now S can now be either 27 or 13 at expiration, which means intrinsic value is going to end up being either 2 or 0, which means the option’s value is 1. Notice how lowering σ decreased total option value. 

Now, let’s increase sigma dramatically to 15. S at expiration will either be 35 or 5, so intrinsic value at expiration with either be 10 or 0, which means the total value of the call option is 5. 

Feel free to try this with as many puts and calls as you want. You will observe that as long as the option isn’t so far in the money that S-σ&gt;K for a call or S+ σ&lt;K for a put, an increase in σ can never decrease option value, and as long as S has the potential to change such that the option may expire OTM or ATM, an increase in volatility will always increase total option value.

**Congratulations: you now understand the basic idea of how options prices relate to the volatility of the underlying asset, and you can express it using a simple options pricing model. (It’s a simplified version of the “binomial model” for readers that want to put a name on it.)** 

You may be wondering how markets determine volatility in the first place. When options trade on the market, the value that the options trade for can be used to determine the σ implied by the trade. For example, if we are using the model we’ve used above, a call option worth $3 where S starts at $5 and K is $4, must have an implied σ of $5. No other σ would produce that total option value. 

In the real world, the implied level of volatility is typically expressed as a % and refers to the standard deviation of the change in S over the course of a year. The model used to calculate implied volatility is typically the Black Scholes model, which we can easily learn once we are able to use all 5 variables in the binomial model. The implied value of σ given an option’s price based on the Black Scholes model is called Implied Volatility or “IV”. We will deal with IV more later. For now, just think of it as the market’s best guess at σ. 

The idea of IV does, however, bring up something we can use now; the IV of an option trading on the market is an estimation collectively arrived at by traders. **IV does not necessarily represent how much S will actually change because the market cannot psychically tell the future.** In other words, the market tries to calculate an appropriate value for σ, but often comes up with something that isn’t subsequently reflected in the actual behavior of the underlying. They get it “wrong,” in a way, and if you watch an option for a while, you’ll observe IV constantly changing. 

There is a way to try to make money from this theory: **If you think σ based on the actual future behavior of the stock will be too high or too low to justify the value at which an option currently trades, you may have a trading opportunity.** 

In that light, let’s do our first imaginary trade. To up the ante, **I’ll give gold to the first person who gets this right and posts the answer in the comments:** Let’s say you think the σ of an asset is going to be $10 based on the model we have used in the previous examples. You look at the option chain (the list of options available on the asset), and you see the options below. You decide you are going to buy one option. Which do you buy, and why?

S = $25

**Calls**

K = $35 Price = $1.00

K = $30 Price = $2.50

K = $25 Price = $3.50

K = $20 Price = $5.00

**Puts**

K = $30 Price = $3.50

K= $25 Price = $2.00

K = $20 Price = $1

K = $15 Price = $0.5

***Supplemental:*** 

***Bid Ask Spread:*** *The difference between the highest bid (offer to buy something) and the lowest ask (offer to sell something) is called the “bid ask spread.” The smaller the bid ask spread is, the more trades usually occur because small spreads imply there is less of a disagreement, measurable in price, between buyers and sellers. This small disagreement means only a small change in the bid or the ask is necessary to make a trade happen.* 

***To Whom Do You Buy or Sell When You Exercise an Option?*** *Ultimately, financial responsibility will fall on the person who wrote (originated or originally sold) the option, but your broker and a group called a “clearing house” are the ones who ensure that a transaction actually occurs when you exercise your option. The important thing to remember is that you do not take counter party risk from the person who wrote the option. That is to say, the person who wrote the option can’t simply refuse to honor their agreement and cheat you. If they try, you’ll still get to profit (to the extent appropriate) when you exercise your option because of the clearing house. The writer becomes their broker’s problem (and eventually law enforcement’s problem) – not yours. Keep an eye out for a post about “assignment” or look up “assignment and clearing houses,” for further reading.*

***Answers to Practice Questions*** 

***Question 1: $5.You exercise to buy for $5, and then you sell in the market for $10.***

personalfinance,Single Premium BPMI Unearned Premium Refund under HPA of 1998?,"I purchased a house approximately a year ago and put a minimal amount down because I didn't want to lock up capital in the house. At the time, buying out PMI upfront was a much better deal than paying monthly PMI. I've learned that the single premium borrower-paid PMI (BPMI) that I purchased is ""non-refundable"". 

Fast forward a year, and rates now look much more attractive in terms of refinancing. But the thing holding me back is the money I'd lose on what I paid upfront for PMI. 

My question is, are any forms of PMI excluded from the homeowner's protection act (HPA) of 1998? More specifically, if I meet all the conditions of the HPA, aren't I entitled to a refund on the unearned premiums on my PMI? Originally, the date for reaching  80% LTV was midway through 2028, but I have the capital to deploy now to hit 80% LTV now. 

If I can get the unearned premium refunded, refinancing all of a sudden becomes much more attractive. I'm thinking I could refi, and pull the money back out and be back in my original position, but with a lower interest rate, as long as I don't have to double-pay for PMI between loans. 

TLDR: If I meet the conditions of the HPA of 1998, am I entitled to unearned premium refund of upfront single premium PMI?",finance

My girlfriend has made several bad financial choices to get to this point and i am trying to find her a path out. 

She already has about 100k in student loans which i finally had her refinance from like 8% down to 4.5%.

But now due to other poor spending habits and an emergency cat surgery, and car trouble she has raked up about 7k credit card debt with about a 20% interest rate. 

Im looking to get her a new credit card that she can balance transfer the 7k to with 0% interest and 0 transfers fees for about 15 months. However i dont think she will be able to pay it off in time, once the deadline approaches would she be able to balance transfer to a new card before the deadline? Or will she be forced to pay off the first card at a rate fast enough to pay it off in those 15 months or face penalties?

I have withdrawn from them in order to save my gpa from going any lower. I was planning on taking a few classes over the summer in order to improve my gpa, and then get my act together and start fresh in the fall. 

However, I’ve been notified I have 1400$ I must repay to the school before being able to take any summer classes. Also, I am not eligible for financial aid for the fall, unless I take 6 credits over the summer which would have to be paid for out of pocket.

Oh and I also have 1400$ in credit card debt that is interest free until August. 

To sum everything up: I must pay 1400$ to the school by summer to be able to take summer classes. If I do that, I’d then have to pay an additional 1500$ for the 6 credits I must take in order to qualify for financial aid for the fall semester. 

My parents do not know about this, nor do they have the money to pay any of it. Any suggestions or info would be appreciated. I feel so hopeless right now. If I can’t attend college I’ll probably apply for the post office or some other federal/state job that can be turned into a career.",finance

I’m headed off to a 4-year private university this August and the total cost of attendance for the 2020-2021 year is $80,000 which includes tuition, room and board, meal plan, personal expenses, flight to campus etc. Luckily, I have three scholarships amounting to $79,000 per year. If it matters, my major is finance and I hope to work in the banking industry when I graduate.

However, in the financial aid package my college sent me, my college didnt include loans of any sort including federal. I think its due to the fact that I only need to pay $1,000 a year. I still want to take out the maximum in federal subsidized loans every year (19k in total, with 3.5k for freshman yr) so I can add it to my emergency fund (I’m independent so I need as much financial cushion as I can get). Also, I think I can easily pay it all back within within a year out of college. Is this still possible?

Edit: I dont necessarily need the loan money, I just think it would be financially saavy to borrow money at a zero percent rate. It’s free money and im just thinking why the hell not. Please correct me if im wrong though",finance

personalfinance,Strategies for paying back student loans with 529 funds? (SECURE Act 2019),"Hi, all. X-post to r/StudentLoans because this is a slightly more complex repayment question. 

After learning about the [SECURE act](https://www.forbes.com/sites/katiepf/2019/12/21/you-can-now-use-a-529-plan-to-repay-student-loans/#4f29ec404aab) allowing for $10,000 from 529 funds to be applied to student loans, I'm super excited to take advantage of this change as I aggressively pay off the balance of my loans. However, I do not have any experience with 529 accounts, so I would appreciate any and all advice about how best to approach this. 

A few details-

1) I have a balance of $22k in federal loans. 


2) With a plan to repay $1.5k per month, I should have the loans paid by May 2021. I anticipate I will pay these more quickly. 


3) I understand that I will not be able to claim interest paid as a deduction on my taxes. 


4) I am in NYS and will have to pay NYS (&amp; NYC) taxes on disbursements from a 529 account, though I will not pay federal taxes. 


A few questions-

1) My plan is to set up direct deposit from work of ~$1k per month to a 529, and then use those funds to make overpayments on my loans. Is this a good idea? Are contribution changes similar to contribution changes for 401ks, in that they are relatively easy to make assuming my payroll/hr department is speedy?


2) Do you have suggestions of resources about how to make payments from 529 accounts? I know I can use Google, but I'm asking in case there is anything weird I should know. 


3) Is there likely to be significant lag between when funds are put into my 529 and when I can use them to pay loans?


4) Should I worry at all about my portfolio breakdown in the 529 (assuming this a thing) since this is essentially a pass-through account?


5) Is there any tax benefit or other benefit to paying the entire $10k (lifetime cap on 529 funds to use for student loan repayment) in one calendar year? If I do so and I still have a balance to pay at the start of 2021 (likely), can I deduct student loan interest for 2021?


6) Is there any special or advised way to prepare for the $10k NYS/NYC tax bomb? I have had a hard time finding calculators that also include NYC tax. 


7) Any other general advice for this?


Thanks so much in advance!",finance

personalfinance,Asking for a $1 raise after 1 year in accounting position- is this reasonable?,"I currently work as a accounting clerk in the Twin Cities MN and will have worked here for 1 year in a couple of months. I make $16.50 an hour at the moment, full 8 hours day 5 days a week. I would like at the very least for a $.50 raise because of annual increases of cost of living. However, I would really prefer to be making $17.25, so I was thinking of asking for $17.50 when I do ask for a raise. I do believe I have earned a raise considering my position and ""department"" was an unorganized mess when I joined. The last employee in my position pretty much abandoned a lot of her responsibilities the last few months before she left and so it was a lot to pick up. But after a few months of me being here my supervisor and I straightened most of everything out and everything runs smoothly now. I am even positively compared to the last 2 people who were in my position. I do think my work has kind of been stale though the last few months and I plan on increasing my performance through the next couple of months. In addition I also have a very good working relationship with both my supervisor and the workplace manager. I get most if not all of my positive feedback from them.

Even though I feel as if I've been a good addition to the accounting department since I've started, I am a lot younger than those I work with and I am currently working towards an accounting certification which will be completed next fall. I did have over 3 years of accounting related experience coming into this. I feel as if I am employed at a lower rate than a lot of others working the same position, but understood when accepting my position that this was because of my limited experience and lack of education. I think that even with a $.75 raise I would still be employed at a lower rate than others with similar positions. I am having a lot of anxiety that I am incorrect, and that I'm making absurd assumptions based on what I wish I was making and not on the reality of the current job market. 

Based on the above information, would asking for a $1 raise be ridiculous- I'm very anxious about being scoffed at- or would it be a reasonable way of trying to achieve my desired raise?

Beyond that, if I end up receiving no raise I will probably plan on staying for 6 more months until I'm done with my accounting program and then to start looking for a new job if nothing improves. It would be a bummer as I actually love my job currently, but ultimately I think I'd rather take a chance on a new work environment for higher pay. Any additional thoughts on whether or not that would also be a dumb/smart move?

Any advice is appreciated! I apologize if I was a bit all over the place! I'm very new to an office setting type workplace and am constantly unsure if I'm moving in the right direction or not. Also please feel free to ask any additional questions. Thanks!",finance

First time/long time. I am having some issues adulting and would really appreciate some experienced input. I don’t have much of a savings, but want to invest what little I have now (and maybe add a portion of my paycheck to it) so that in 20 years or so it will be a decent egg to sit on. It's not a lot of money but as it's more than I've had in a while I want to be smart about it. So I have a few questions that no adult in my life can answer:

* What are the benefits of having an account with a credit union versus a bank?
   * I have a checking account with a bank and have been curious to join a credit union. Why? Curiosity, I guess. Also banks are bad, right?
   * Later this year or early next, I will need a car loan. Could a credit union offer a better interest rate than my (or another) bank? I have a solid credit score, around 800.
* What is the more prudent type of account to open: Money Market or Savings? Is there another type of account to consider?
   * I want to start an account to accrue a savings, withdrawing nothing for at least 15-20 years. I understand Money Market rates fluctuate without warning (or notice, according to my bank’s documentation), but is it worth it to ride out the sometimes rocky waters or is it better to open a savings account with a fixed interest rate (assuming that is a thing)?
   * FWIW my employer offers a 403(b) which I am considering joining as well. 
* Should I just bite the bullet and go into the credit union and banks to talk with people there?

That’s all I can think to ask for now. I really do appreciate whatever helpful insight you can offer. They ran out of the ""So You're An Adult"" pamphlets before I could get my hands on one.",finance

Current debt: (currently have limited info on interest rates)

Mortgage: Owe $58K, currently worth 150-180k, but can be probably 220-240 if money reinvested into (needs floors/rugs/updating/cosmetic blemishes)

Credit Cards: $14,800 between them all, don't know interest rates but after a bankruptcy i cant imagine they are any lower than high 20-30% interest rates.

Car Loan: $12K  since debt was rolled from previous vehicle into current vehicle, which is also high mileage now (170K miles), since driving is the biggest part of this parent's job.

Camper: $26K with 11% interest. 

Credit scores- 680 and 660, they are both now married living in HIS house which to my knowledge is paid for, but a sibling is living in the house with mortgage until he is done with school( 6 months or so)

Proposed was to refinance house with 58k debt left and pull roughly 100k from equity from house.
This will (hopefully):
-Pay off CC, camper, and car debts (54K total)
-provide large down payment for car
-leave $35k-40k to fix up house in order to sell in 6 months-1 year when sibling is gone, which ideally would sell for 220k at a min, ( good neighborhood, nice sized house)

Now I know the camper should just be gone but it means a lot to parent and highly doubt it will be considered to sell.

I bought all of the shares around the par value of $25.00 and they pay 6.35% - 7.25% dividends quarterly. They are from a couple of different REITs that are respected companies with $10+ billion equity market caps (DLR, SLG, BPY - well, some are more like $7B after this week). All of the dividends are cumulative so if they suspend paying they accrue and must be paid before anything goes to common shareholders.

I hold the shares in retirement accounts to shield from income tax and I'm only 30 years old so they can sit there for many years. I understand that if interest rates rise the share price will fall, but ultimately the companies can only buy the shares back for $25.00 whether that is in 1, 5 or 15 years. Unless I misunderstand the position of the preferred shares in the capital stack, you'd only take a loss if the company went bankrupt /common shares go to $0. 

I'm totally good having a portion of my portfolio earn a 6-7% return ""forever"" (until they are eventually bought back at $25.00). I guess one risk is if inflation really went wild for some reason I'd have to sell for a big loss if I wanted to reinvest the proceeds in a growth stock.

personalfinance,Single mom needs to buckle down but I need help/advice,"I make $100k per year, recently divorced and used the settlement to put a down payment on my own home where I live with my kids. I have a mortgage but a ton of credit card debt, personal loans, and school loans (least concerned about those because of the low fixed interest rate). But due to a ton of repairs I had to do on the home that weren't picked up by the home inspectors, I'm in deeper than I realized and I can't believe that I'm living paycheck to paycheck and overdrafting at that. I have pretty much used most of my retirement savings on these huge emergency repairs that weren't covered by my home insurance (at least not without long delays). Also a ton of bad decisions over time of course (the majority of the credit card debt) and mostly crazy holiday shopping every year for my kids and paying for athletic trips for my older son. I don't even want to think about what I owe in taxes this year. I can't bear to look at it yet but I'm sure I will need a payment plan.

I have zero desire to file bankruptcy but I need relief. I've been on a payment plan for one year with one credit card that has helped a great deal because they froze it (not closed it) but I still find it shocking that on a $26k balance, I only paid down $3k of it in 12 months' time (the program is up next month and the interest rate will return to normal). I have another credit card $18k at 18% I think. A 3rd credit card at 14% of $7k, $1200 in smaller consumer ccs (Lowes, Home Depot, Care Credit), $8k personal loan, and $60k remaining in student loans but that's at 4%.

I am not in the position to find a 2nd job although I am looking for a similar FT one that pays more. I took a slight paycut 2 years before my divorce to be home for one of my sons who has special needs, so I'm really trying to find something similar where I have a flexible schedule but pays more. I've been making money here and there doing tutoring work but we are talking $50 here and there.

It's the fact that I can't get any traction with my minimum payments due to interest. I paid the $18k $600 one month and $300 was put right back on interest. Do I close this card just to take advantage of a lower rate? It's one of my oldest cards. They won't freeze it like the other cc.

$55 work phone

$522 student loans

$370 personal loan

$1150 credit cards/lines (but this will go up by some amount next month when I go off the payment program, not sure what the new amount will be)

$100 Events and Adventures (stupid, stupid decision - it's a contract I can't get out of it but payments should stop in October)

$105 car insurance (I own my car)

$115 storage unit

$125 pool maintenance (bare bones - I plan to figure this out so I don't have to pay anything and I can get my boys to do physical work)

$400 avg groceries but trying to reduce this and if my kids eat chicken, rice and beans 3x a week so be it.

$120 gas

I've stopped going out to movies/doordash/subscriptions. My biggest sinkhole is Amazon plain and simple. Groceries delivered to my door, school supplies on the fly for my kids, something they break... I admit I've been in permissive mode for them since the divorce and I have to stop. I've started telling them I can't pay for things and then they become even more upset, but not too upset to give me advance notice if they need a digestive model for class!!

I digress. I'm simply not getting ahead. And lawn services not sure what to do with that. I purchased a home that has elaborate landscaping that I'm not equipped to handle. It's not so much mowing but taking care of exotic plants, fertilizer, mulch, etc. but I'll try to educate myself. Full lawn service around here is $200 month! In the past it was great to not worry about it and just have everything taken care of seasonally, but now that's a no-go.

The biggest issue is really the credit cards and credit lines. I am so hesitant for credit consolidation. Isn't it possible to just call the companies and tell them I can only afford this amount? Pay something instead of late payments? That's one reason I overdraft which is dumb. I have stuff on autopay so I have an excellent payment history but then I leave myself with literally no money in my checking, supremely dumb. I have a budget program but clearly I'm not checking it because I'm just paying for things because I'm told to, instead of paying myself first and leaving myself a buffer, even if it means being a little late on a payment. I'm currently negative $300 in my checking until I get paid on Friday. The overdraft fees alone...

Sorry for the all-over-the-place post. As you can see, I'm a bit overwhelmed but I know it's a matter of discipline, organization, getting out of my ADHD head, and buckling down to figure this out. My credit score is fair right now at 650/680 depending on the agency.",finance

stocks,Treasury yield hits record low,"**The 10 year treasury bond is one of the greatest signals of investor confidence.**

[It's at its lowest level in history](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/09/10-year-treasury-yield-plunges.html).

The VIX (the volatility index) spiked to the [highest levels we've seen since 2008](https://www.barrons.com/articles/volatility-index-vix-spikes-to-highest-level-since-the-financial-crisis-51583775990) on Monday.

It ain't looking good...

Let's start off with the Coronavirus, and the narrative that this is the Black Swan.

Ultimately, this virus is the jet fuel to the warning signs that have been there for many months.

(Of course we had the [yield curve inversion providing the explicit warning](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/yield-curve-inversion-explained-what-it-is-what-it-means-2019-8-1028482016).)

Yes there will be issues with supply chains and real world consequences due to quarantines and deaths (it seems fairly likely that with the viral coefficient of this thing that there will be a significant number of deaths), but in my opinion the Coronavirus offers a convenient excuse to the masses and distracts from more underlying and deep rooted issues.

Since 2008, we've had Central Banks printing trillions.

Via the Cantillon Effect, money creation itself increases inequality by fuelling asset price inflation.

We've also had a splurge of stock buybacks - corporations buying back their own stock - with stock buybacks being the [main source of demand on the buy-side for equities](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/buybacks-are-the-dominant-source-of-stock-market-demand-and-they-are-fading-fast-goldman-sachs-2019-11-06).

Worryingly, they [decreased in Q2 2019](https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/trending/3OSHLeeCPiSKizII70QwYA2).

We've had record levels of corporate debt, which (instead of being used to invest in the real economy) has been used to finance these **STOCK BUYBACKS**.

(In this period we have seen record wealth inequality, and the middle class have been hammered.)

We also have the Repo mess - with the NY Fed recently increasing daily Repo operations from $100BN to $150BN.

We also have hedge funds dangerously over-leveraged.

As well as this, we have had a recent phenomenon of a lot of CEOs resigning in the last year.

Bob Iger [suddenly stepping down](https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2020/02/bob-iger-steps-down-disney) is a prime example.

If you were in your 60s and were making millions of dollars every year as CEO, with a bonus dependent on stock performance, would you:

A) Retire before SHTF and put your feet up as a multi millionaire

or B) Keep your position, SHTF, people lose their jobs and you become a source of hate since you're still making millions (although the bonus is way less because of stock performance).

Remember, you're in your 60s - do you really want to deal with this?

It's important to focus on what people do and not what they say:

2. Will the cash ISA stay with Natwest or will that transfer too?

My initial guess is the savings account will close (money transfered? DIf so do I do it before I switch?) and the cash ISA will stay open but I'm not sure.

financialindependence,Dividend investing to pay for everything,"Almost there.  About 15 years ago, I decided to stop day trading and start buying dividend paying stocks. The end goal was to buy enough shares of something that would pay enough to cover one monthly bill.  Starting small, so I could feel a sense of accomplishment early, I picked the natural gas bill, which was about $40 at the most.

Doing the math, each $120 I invested at 10% would pay out out about $1 monthly. $100 at 12% is the same. $200 at 6% still results in abouy $1 per month on average.

The calculations in my head were telling me that $40/month goal means all I have to do is invest $4000 and I can subtract the gas bill from my monthly expenses every month. After several months of not buying Starbucks, not eating out as much, scrimping and saving, I had bought enough shares and eliminated that pesky gas bill.

Nice.  That just left about 5 more bills, all of which were larger than the first one.

What I realized along the way was that I was paying far more than I really needed. Cable TV was running about $100 per month, cell phone another $80. Eventually I quit paying for cable and installed an antenna in the attic for about $60 total. $0.00 every month.  I had about 6 or 7 watchable channels, while the rest were either in Spanish, selling garbage, or just had trash programming. Since I was spending nothing, I opted for a Netflix subscription for about $12/mo. Guess what my new dividends paid for next.  $1200 invested in a 10% stock, and Netflix is now essentially free.

Fast forward to today. Many bills have been reduced (better cell phone plan for $40/mo) or eliminated (cable TV). Netflix is now $14/mo, but still being paid for by dividends. Nearly every monthly bill I still have is paid for by dividends. The exceptions are taxes (property and federal income). While they are recurring, they aren't monthly. Now I can go into a restaurant, slap down my Robinhood debit card (more likely my credit card that earns points) and pay for anything I want to eat. Paid for by my dividend account.  For the first time, I no longer worry about how the next paycheck will need to be split up to pay for all the things life throws my way.

What's next? Of course, I'll continue working my day job that allows me to pay the tax man, but eventually that will be paid for, and I'll finally be ahead of the game. As long as I don't get hit by a bus.",finance
personalfinance,Looking for lowest rate on credit card,"Hi all - looking for a low interest rate credit card or something similar if there is a better way to mitigate risk.
My wife and I have great credit (750+) and we have limited our expenses down to about 2500 a month (this accounts for the minimum payments on our loans, bills, mortgage) We pull in just over 6k a month after taxes, health insurance and retirement savings)

A couple of years ago, I took out a personal loan via an online company. At that time I was coming out of an extended period of unemployment and all my credit cards were maxed out.

I took out a personal loan of 30k at 25% APR and paid down all my credit cards. Of course, I began using the cards again and now I have another 10k in CC debt (0% interest on this card). This has to stop and I'm going to make a change. I can't keep doing this. 

That interest rate is killing me. I was making 80k at the time I took out that loan but with a bunch of fixed expenses, I was only able to make the monthly payments on the personal loan and not pay ahead. 

A couple of months ago I lucked out and landed a job that pays 140k. I'd like to take advantage of my much better Debt-to-Income ratio to refinance that personal loan to a less brutal rate and using the difference to pay the refinanced loan more aggressively. 

Is something like this possible? My credit score has gone up 56 points since I started this new job. Will that help?",finance
personalfinance,"Just before coronavirus hit, I went under contract to purchase a townhouse. Worried now - can I still pull out? Should I?","54yo, single, just landed a stable 80K/yr job with a three year contract after years of uncertainty, so I thought, at last I can look for a place to buy. I put in an offer on a nice 3BR townhouse in a cool area that I love. Part of the impetus to buy was nearby bars &amp; restaurants, plus being able to host my elderly parents and various friends who want to visit &amp; go to a nearby big city. It is close to mass transit to the city. I have excellent credit &amp; got a great deal on a 3.5% mortgage (30yr fixed). It is a very hot market here and I put in an offer the day I saw the place (its first open house, day 2 on the market) and after a little bidding war with 2 other buyers, the seller agreed to $390,000, which was a bit above asking. It was built in 2015 and sailed through inspection &amp; appraisal with no problems. I’m now “locked in” (not sure what that really means!). Closing is April 1.

The day after the inspection, coronavirus jumped out of China. I guess it must have been in the news a little bit before that, but it seemed then like another of those little local outbreaks that would burn out. 

The appraisal was last week when the market had its first big crash. The appraisal came in a bit below my offer and the seller caved immediately and dropped the price to the appraisal price, I think because they were skittish about the market and were worried I would walk.

Now I am “locked in” at the appraisal price, $385,500. Over the weekend talking to 3 friends I have in Europe, I’ve been getting more and more uncertain about this. I feel certain we’re headed to a recession - I’m a biologist btw and I don’t see this blowing over in less than 6 mos, possibly 12 mos or more. Also, the reasons I had to buy the townhouse have all just disappeared!  (for the near future anyway) - my parents &amp; friends have cancelled all plans to visit me this summer, and I don’t think I’ll be spending much time at bars/restaurants or on the mass transit!

But mostly I’m worried about the housing market. I don’t mind if the housing market flattens - I’m not in this to make money, just want my own place where I could host people- but I’m worried about ending up badly underwater. I am hoping to move somewhere else in 4-5 years and I don’t want to end up trapped (unable to sell it for enough to cover my loan). (also there is no option to rent it out - it’s in an HOA that doesn’t allow renting) (ps, all houses here are in HOAs, there is no other option)

I am doing this alone and don’t really have anybody to talk it over with. I haven’t yet confessed all this to my realtor or mortgage guy. So:

- is it even possible to walk away at this stage? I know I would lose my earnest money ($3000), but if I’m okay with that, is it possible to walk away?

- is it possible at this stage to re-negotiate the loan to get an even lower interest rate? I had arranged 3.5% but I know I’d qualify for something lower now. I have superb credit (credit score 810, 250k in liquid assets - I once had a little condo that I sold &amp; I’ve been sitting on that till I was ready to buy - and zero debt. Decent retirement savings. Stable job w the 3 yr contract. The mortgage broker said they were salivating over me, ha ha)

- if it’s possible to walk away, should I?? I’m currently in a rental that is perfectly fine and I could stay there longer, see what happens and maybe start looking again in summer. I know nobody has a crystal ball, but what would you do if it were you?

Many thanks for any advice. I just feel so nervous right now. I’ve scrimped &amp; saved for so frickin’ long all on my own &amp; I am FINALLY on financially stable footing &amp; just ~10 years from retirement, &amp; I’m scared of messing it all up now.

thanks very much.",finance

business,How Are SMEs Impacted by Corona Virus?,"Covid-19 is spreading to more countries and continents and it still doesn’t look like the spread of Covid-19 is going to slow down anytime soon, which means we could see an impact on the economies of several countries at the same time. This essentially means we could see a synchronized global impact in terms of economic activity and GDP growth.  
   
***Please note that the impact will be felt more on the medium and small enterprises, which may not have the capacity to withstand a prolonged economic slowdown.***  


The immediate and the most visible impact is on global commodity companies. Metal-and-Mining and Oil-and-Gas companies will be hit the worst. It is expected that earnings of metal and upstream oil companies will get cut significantly. Downstream oil and gas companies will also see an impact, but it is more a function of margins in their case. Refining margins of these companies have been low even before the Covid-19 issue. **However, marketing companies would see a sharp increase in marketing margins because of decline.** Since, they have not yet cut the retail prices of diesel and petrol, and their marketing margins have expanded sharply. 

Auto sales will be down in this kind of an environment and they have been quite weak anyway. The other form of impact to earnings could be through disruption to supply chains and this would depend on what types of supply chains get disrupted and for what period of time.  
 

*However, if we closely monitor, we might notice that great companies are available at lower prices, largely driven by the sense of fear and panic in the market. I believe that this is a good time for making necessary changes. Having said that, one should not assume that the recovery would be immediate.*  
   
The delicate balance arises from business models that, unlike major firms, lean heavily on single suppliers and run on tight cash reserves. 

Chaturvedi, a professor at Arizona State University’s W.P. Carey School of Business, said he’s not worried about major U.S. firms’ resilience to partial or even full-year profit sluggishness, and instead considers protecting smaller companies as key.

“**Small and medium-sized businesses (SMEs) that are the heart and soul of this country (Read USA) are the ones that are going to be the hardest hit**,” Chaturvedi told Yahoo Finance on Friday. “Even when things improve, they’re walking a very thin line here.”

Former New York Stock Exchange floor trader and founder of Sarge986 LLC, Stephen Guilfoyle, argued that the Federal Reserve should immediately increase short-term liquidity for small business.

“**Why this is important is because nothing is more important than the velocity of money.** Nothing is more important to preserving jobs. Nothing is more important to keeping small businesses right now from going under, as they can't get the supplies that they need to make sales now,” he said.

These entire scenarios are applicable to any startup across the globe. But, doesn’t history show us the same trend of evolution. You can’t deny any fact. The sooner you accept any reality the better you can hope for better future. So, try to find a way out. **Even if you are a small business owner or running a dwindling business, you can make impactful changes which might seem really insignificant. So, Carry On!!**",finance

My confusion comes from before that semester before I had any financial aid. In Spring 2019 I paid $3,856 and a couple hundred on textbooks without any financial aid. I paid $2,128 for 2 summer classes 2019, and I spent $999 in winter 2019 for another class. All together tuition was $12,952.

My payment history for 2019 adds to $12,952 but my schools 1098-T box 1 says I have $10,473 ""Payments received for qualified tuition and related expenses"". Box 5 (Scholarships and grants) is $5969. 

By every definition online and reddit I meet the conditions of not having it be taxable income since my qualifying tuition expenses exceed my Pell grant, but I am worried that since I did receive a refund and my only other tuition cost after financial aid was the $999 winter class that I have to still place it as income.

economy,Potential Stock Market Crash (10 year Treasury yields hit record lows),"**The 10 year treasury bond is one of the greatest signals of investor confidence.**

[It's at its lowest level in history](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/09/10-year-treasury-yield-plunges.html).

The VIX (the volatility index) spiked to the [highest levels we've seen since 2008](https://www.barrons.com/articles/volatility-index-vix-spikes-to-highest-level-since-the-financial-crisis-51583775990) on Monday.

It ain't looking good...

Let's start off with the Coronavirus, and the narrative that this is the Black Swan.

Ultimately, this virus is the jet fuel to the warning signs that have been there for many months.

(Of course we had the [yield curve inversion providing the explicit warning](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/yield-curve-inversion-explained-what-it-is-what-it-means-2019-8-1028482016).)

Yes there will be issues with supply chains and real world consequences due to quarantines and deaths (it seems fairly likely that with the viral coefficient of this thing that there will be a significant number of deaths), but in my opinion the Coronavirus offers a convenient excuse to the masses and distracts from more underlying and deep rooted issues.

Since 2008, we've had Central Banks printing trillions.

Via the Cantillon Effect, [money creation itself increases inequality](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv5xl1AEeQs) by fuelling asset price inflation.

We've also had a splurge of stock buybacks - corporations buying back their own stock - with stock buybacks being the [main source of demand on the buy-side for equities](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/buybacks-are-the-dominant-source-of-stock-market-demand-and-they-are-fading-fast-goldman-sachs-2019-11-06).

Worryingly, they [decreased in Q2 2019](https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/trending/3OSHLeeCPiSKizII70QwYA2).

We've had record levels of corporate debt, which (instead of being used to invest in the real economy) has been used to finance these **STOCK BUYBACKS**.

(In this period we have seen record wealth inequality, and the middle class have been hammered.)

We also have the Repo mess - with the NY Fed recently increasing daily Repo operations from $100BN to $150BN.

We also have hedge funds dangerously over-leveraged.

As well as this, we have had a recent phenomenon of a lot of CEOs resigning in the last year.

Bob Iger [suddenly stepping down](https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2020/02/bob-iger-steps-down-disney) is a prime example.

If you were in your 60s and were making millions of dollars every year as CEO, with a bonus dependent on stock performance, would you:

A) Retire before SHTF and put your feet up as a multi millionaire

or B) Keep your position, SHTF, people lose their jobs and you become a source of hate since you're still making millions (although the bonus is way less because of stock performance).

Remember, you're in your 60s - do you really want to deal with this?

It's important to focus on what people do and not what they say:

Warren Buffett is sitting on cash. A LOT of cash.

Big corporations are sitting on cash ready to buy the blood...

personalfinance,Should I stop looking for a house? -Corona virus related-,"We put an offer on a house last week and just heard that they went with someone else's offer. But given the following conditions, should I stop looking for a home? Might have been a blessing in disguise. For vs against:

Why I should stop looking:

1. My industry is probably THE worst effected economically by the corona virus. I am slightly more insulated than many of my comrades, but I will lose money this year.
2. Interest rates will be lower in the near future... again thanks to the political whims brought on by the outbreaks
3. I live in a high cost of living area where houses are extremely hard to come by even if you have money. If I say in my current apartment (one bed), I should be able to stack some decent cash for a better down payment, even if I lose quite a bit of business.

Why I should keep looking:

1. I want to start a family and that becomes biologically dangerous for my wife if we keep waiting and waiting. We're mid 30's
2. I CAN afford it... But not terribly comfortably. 
3. My business involves an office space and tools that will force me into a larger apartment soon, if I want to continue seeing growth.
4. Even with rent control, I'll be paying similar rent to what my mortgage+other ownership costs will be in less than 5 years... For a shitty apartment. I made a spreadsheet...

This corona thing is coming at a very bad time for me, but it's hard to complain when people are getting sick and some are dying... I've spent the last 12 years working my ass off to get out of debt and finally offer my wife a shot at being a mother, and now I might have to ask her to continue waiting another year or two for this. Anyway. I want to make the smart decision.",finance

personalfinance,Should I be buying a home right now?,"My fiancé and I are getting married in a couple weeks, and we also recently found a house we love. We’ve made an offer, had it inspected, applied for a loan and put a deposit down so far. This is our first house, so all of this is new for both of us. 

With the market dipping like it has, and with the feds cutting rates, is it still a good idea for us to proceed?

Does the rate care affect mortgage interest rates? (It’s a VA loan)

datascience,How do I compute this percentage from the available data? Is this a linear regression? Data science project.,"I just came up with a data science-y project idea but I need help with the math side of it.

I will take studies that have found a correlation between cannabis use in undeveloped brains and decreased cognitive capacity and for the sake of this example I will input 2 variables: average frequency of consumption and quantity consumed. I will take this through a python script and I will output a mathematical function that connects two percentages: the probability (first percentage) X% that you will be Y% less capable than the average non-smoker person in either short-term memory, attention span, etc.

The problem is I know literally no statistics so I'm kinda struggling with the math side. Is this what you'd call a linear regression? What is the actual algorithm for outputting this mathematical function? I first thought I would have to just do some sort of arithmetic mean but it got more complicated when you had more values. For example I can have this data set (a bigger sample would give more accuracy but I'm gonna give a sample of 3 so this example is easier)

Let f be the average frequency of use in days: how much days do they wait in between smoke sessions

Let q be the average quantity they consume in each session (in grams or whatever unit of measure, doesn't matter).

User 1: f = 7, q = 1

User 2: f = 14, q = 1.2

User 3: f = 3, q = 0.5

Each user will also have a variable representing how much less capable they are than the average person on a certain mental task. In reality I'm probably gonna have a list of variables for each user so I compute a separate mathematical function for each mental ability (memory, attention span, etc.) but for the sake of this example let's say they have just one more variable representing how worse they are from the average person at attention span. Let it be a.

User 1: a = 0.2 (20%)

User 2: a = 0.1

User 3: a = 0.3

Now I have to use all this data to compute a mathematical function f : S -&gt; [0;1], S = {f, q, p | f, q are from R+, p is from [0;1] } which takes in the percentage of probability that the output is gonna happen as well as f and q and outputs the percentage decrease in attention span from the normal person (basically a). Now that I think of it, it should work in reverse too, inputting the percentage decrease and outputting the probability that will happen so this function also has to be *bijective*. Actually it's not bijective per se, because I just reverse a and p. I add a in the domain set ""S"" and take out p in the output. Anyway...

Now what I need help with is computing the larger function that takes in two variables and outputs the function f. And that larger function is fed before two *lists* of variables to have the proper data. That will be the script I will write. I'm stumped, because it's taking in three lists of variables and outputs 2. If it was just two outputting 1 it would be easier, for example:

User 1: f = 7, a = 0.3

User 2: f = 14, a = 0.1

User 3: f = 3, a = 0.5

It's way easier to do it now, having to output just a. If I input 7, 14 or 3 I know what I'm going to get. If I output anything else between 3 and 14 I just have to find out the relation between the two closest variables. From 14 to 7, f halved and a tripled. This would mean that (most likely) if f quarters then a would be multiplied by 1.5, if f is divided by 3 a would be multiplied by 4.5 etc. That's for any variable between 14 and 7. Between 3 and 7 I do the same with the other data. Is this a correct approach? Either way if you also have to add the output p besides the output a I'm stuck. Then you also add the input q and I'm even more stuck. 

So what do I have to do ?

As we know logging in to the server, installing nano / vim and manually editing the conf files are a no-no way in dockerized environment since this will not persist after container shutdown, scale, restart, or whatever any other reason.

Its funny how some basic automation that things like traefik provides are initially great, but later seems to be like ""oh well f\*\*\*ed now...""

personalfinance,I'm a student who has just been blindsided by unexpected taxes that I can't afford. How do I handle this situation?,"It's a long story, but I figured I should include the whole picture for the sake of completeness: I (24M) am currently in my second year of medical school, and until recently it didn't even occur to me that I would need to file a tax return this year (I am married and our household income is well under the standard deduction for 2019). The only reason that I even started looking into this tax mess (which I'm glad that I did) is that the grace period of my wife's federal student loans expires soon, and I figured I would need to file a joint tax return so that we would qualify for an income based repayment plan. At this point I was not concerned since I didn't think that we made nearly enough money to even owe the IRS anything, but we certainly can't afford the standard 10 year repayment plan on her loan, which made filing our taxes a no-brainer. I thought that I had a reasonable understanding of how taxes worked and apparently, I was DEAD WRONG.

&amp;#x200B;

We own a house together, which may seem unreasonable at this stage in our lives, but (after doing a lot of math and spreadsheets) it made financial sense to us given that our mortgage payments and utilities are quite comparable to what our expenses would be if we lived in an apartment in the area (so far that comparison has remained relatively accurate based on my classmates' financial situations). I receive student loans to pay for my education and some living expenses, but they are not nearly enough to cover what my wife (25F) and I need to survive while I am in medical school (and we live very frugally, cooking our own meals, making our own home repairs, and any other way that we can cut costs). Until very recently, my wife has been relentlessly on the dismal pursuit of gainful employment, and finally landed an entry-level position a couple of months ago. Since she is just starting out, and since much of the beginning was (poorly) ""paid"" training, she had less than $2,000 of total income from this job in 2019. Being a proactive person, I took it upon myself to make up our financial deficit by the way of doing food delivery driving in the evenings after classes ended (and I take great pride in being able to hold a side hustle while maintaining my grades in medical school). It was a sacrifice that I was willing to make in order to ensure that we had a roof over our heads and that our bills were paid.

&amp;#x200B;

When it became evident that I would need to file a tax return for us, I remembered (and dug up) a reddit [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ecscwk/what_free_things_online_should_everyone_take/fbdhkwl?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x) from a few months ago that stated how I could file for free if we made under $69,000 (Thanks for the tip, u/Portarossa!) and I got to work on our taxes. Our total household income (not including student loan support) for 2019 was only $13,300, so I was confident (and very naive) that we would not owe anything, and that filing was more of a formality than anything else. What I did not know was that the earnings from delivery driving for services like GrubHub fall under the self-employment tax, which is entirely different that the typical income taxes that are withheld from the paychecks of actual W-2 employees of a business. I understood that I was technically not their employee, but I thought taxes on my end were the same kind of income taxes as anybody else making a paycheck, just that I had to pay taxes at the end if made enough to owe anything (I know this was very stupid of me, and I should've known better/done more research). I also had no idea that the standard deduction ($24,400 for a married couple filing jointly) did not apply to the self-employment tax. Furthermore, I had no idea that all of our other expenses that are ""tax deductible"" could not be deducted from self-employment income (such as the $2,800 for my health insurance premiums and \~$15K for the combination of interest, insurance, and property taxes on our home).

&amp;#x200B;

What I now realize is that the only deductions that I could possibly make from my self-employment income are the expenses for my car (mileage, gas, etc.), which I stupidly didn't bother to keep track of given that I was under the impression that I wouldn't even need to file taxes (and if I did, I thought I had much more simple and straightforward deductions that I could use). I have read that I can sort of rebuild my mileage and gas purchases into something that I could report, but I use my car for personal things as well (if I could afford a car just for business purposes I wouldn't need to do deliveries in the first place), and I have no reliable way of differentiating exactly what miles were personal/business. I know that if I get audited since reporting \~30k miles on my car is a bit of a red flag, my records HAVE to be accurate. It feels like trying to claim those deductions may be more trouble than they are worth at this point.

&amp;#x200B;

Given this current situation, I have no idea how to proceed. Since nothing was ever withheld from my delivery pay (and I didn't set any aside for taxes) we will owe about $1,500 to the IRS upon filing our taxes. We have always set aside some money for an emergency fund, but for various expenses throughout the year (AC repair, etc.) that emergency fund is not nearly as big as I am comfortable with. In a way, you could say that we have the money to cover the taxes, but if we pay them all upfront I worry that we will not be able to keep up with our mortgage payments in the next few months, and that is not an option. I have certainly learned my lesson in this ordeal, and I want to fix this situation in the most financially responsible manner that I can. I don't want to make any stupid decisions out of panic. I know that I can't ignore the bill, and I have far too much on my plate right now to add the financial and legal woes of tax evasion to the mix.

&amp;#x200B;

If any of you kind internet strangers have made it all the way through my wall of text, I sincerely appreciate your time, and would love to know if you have any advice for me. What are our options for paying the taxes that we owe without risking further financial difficulties? What are the implications if we can't pay? How do we avoid getting into any legal trouble for this misunderstanding? Does any of this affect my eligibility for student loans (which could very well obliterate my dreams of becoming a doctor)?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I'm a medical student who was extremely misinformed about self-employment taxes, and now my wife and I owe the IRS \~$1,500 in taxes that we're not prepared to pay. Got any advice for me?

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: Thank you to all that took the time to respond and give advice. I spent a good deal of time over the past couple of days, and I was able to build somewhat of a mileage and expense log. With the minimal records I was able to track down, my final deductions weren't much, but I was able to knock off about $300 from the tax bill, which is still a lot of money for us at this stage in our lives, so I'm happy with that. I know it's only a small portion of the mileage I've claimed, but I'm not about to claim more than I can prove in the rare instance of an audit or something. I submitted a request for a payment plan to minimize the financial hit of the remaining $1,200. I've learned a valuable lesson from this situation and will be keeping an accurate log of all my mileage and vehicle expenses from this point on.",finance

We're looking to refinance. We owe just over $50k on a home valued around $230k or so. Our interest rate is 4.375%. Does anyone have any recommendations on lenders or brokers that offer a better rate with no closing costs?

We have contacted a few that offer no closing costs, but it always turns out to be no closing costs *out of pocket* since they roll them into the loan. We don't owe that much and we plan to pay off the mortgage in the next 3 or 4 years, so I don't think it makes a lot sense to refinance unless we can get a truly 'no closing costs' option.

Thanks in advance for all your suggestions!

personalfinance,Shopping for first home purchase - Will market downturn affect housing markets?,"My question is simply this.... are we buying a home at the perfect time due to great interest rates? Or will it turn out to be a horrible time due to the unknowns of a coronavirus recession?

personalfinance,Student Loan Refinance,"With rates at an all-time low again and likely to drop even further, has anyone recently refinanced their student loans? I currently have about \~69K left on my student loans at an interest rate of 4.625%. My monthly payment is \~$575 a month.

I was highly interested in FIGURE since they offered me a 20 year term at 4.2% which would drop my monthly payment to the low 400s. Unfortunately their ""application linking"" system does not recognize Elfi who my current loan is through.

Credit score is 750+ and salary is at 95K",finance
personalfinance,Inquiry about paying down Mortgage?,"Hi guys,

I've been a homeowner for about a year now and am looking to make sure I'm being as fiscally responsible as possible about it. I'm presented now with an opportunity to lower my monthly payments, but I'm not sure if the long-term lookout is worth doing so.

Details:

* Purchase Price: 331,000
* Downpayment: 10% (33,100)
   * Was in a rush to buy and didn't have 20% to contribute last year
* PMI: Roughly 100 / month
* Rate: 4.875% (Condo)
* Outstanding Balance: $287,013
   * After maxing out my 401k last year, I began to pay 1,000/month into the capital amount.
* 20% Equity Goal: 264,800
   * Remainder to pay: **22,213**

If I paid the 22k needed to reach 20% equity, I'd still have a strong savings to last me about 1 year if I lost my job. What gives me concern is:

* Current Monthly Payment: 2,069
* Projected Monthly payment if 20% hit: 1,700
   * Removing PMI, better interest rate after refinancing, etc
* Monthly Savings :: 22k Payment Break-even: 6.1 years
   * This does not take into account interest paid.
   * I'm not sure if I calculated this correctly

The question I have, then: I sit worth letting go of 22k today, or am I better off holding on to it? I don't intend to sell the house in the next 5 years or so but I'm not terribly familiar with real estate and want to make sure I'm taking the right approach.

What are your thoughts? Many, many thanks in advance!",finance

In the year and change since I have been out of school I have been pretty aggressive in paying back my student loans. I have wondered though if the extra money I put toward those loans each month could be working harder for me. My loans all feature 4% or lower interest rates and it seems that investing that extra chunk I pay could be making me more than the interest is costing me. I suppose the first question I am asking is if that is a correct assumption?

If that is a correct assumption it leads me to ask whether a robo investor is the best choice at this stage in my career, over opting for an advisor. Can you opt to switch over to an advisor X years down the line once your investments reach a level to warrant it?

**GOALS OF THE BOYCOTT**



1) Prevent another dictatorship in Brazil



2) Demonstrate that we are a democracy, the power emanates from the population, and that's what we are going to do: to show that the power comes from us citizens, and we are not going to stay quiet with dictatorship attempts, neither from government nor private companies sponsoring the coup



3) ATTENTION: this is not a political-party movement, it does not have the intention to change your living standard. It is not about Left/Right. Brazil is heading towards a dictatorship, and THIS IS SERIOUS. (paraphrasing)[https://www.reddit.com/r/brasil/comments/fbw944/3_dia_boicote_nacional_empresas_que_querem/fj9udfc] our Reddit fellow: **the problem is not Bolsonaro himself, but what he represents. And it is these people represented by him who are happy with his government. People like christian ultraconservative businessmen/businesswomen, for instance. And all of them support that Bolsonaro terminates the Congress and the Supreme Tribunal of Juscice (the highest Judiciary house). And that is literally a Coup D’état. And if you look the history, a large part of dictatorships started officialy on the day the Congresso was terminated**



.



**BOYCOTT STRATEGIES (DISCUSS BELLOW)**



\*Remember the boycott **every day** at least until 2020 March 15th


*Post on r/brasil (it is already been done daily since feb 28th)


*Campaign on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram: \#NATIONALBOYCOT. SAY NO TO BRAZILIAN DICTATORSHIP. Let's post with the text above with the companies list, and spread



*""I don't buy their products/services already"". Great! You can help spreading the campaign with other people who didn't join yet



*Create and post visual materials for the boycott: brief and handy information, links or qr code of the news proving the involvement of these companies. Nothing has been produced yet, but there's an image on Instagram 'Golpe em Progresso"" (Coup In Progress) on the brazilian flag: https://www.instagram.com/p/B9H6BdanXoG/?igshid=1952ed2mq76qo



*Raise awarness for the population about the Military Dictatorship Period in Brazil from 1964 to 1985, for it does not repeat the story


*Convince friends not to buy products and services from these companies, neither from physical store nor on internet



*Suspend contracts with these companies and search for anothers which provide the same service


*Suspend purchases and pendent card invoices, and send back acquired products


*Withdraw stocks and investments from Financial Market in the name of these companies


*Find and spread information (WITH TRUE SOURCES) of other companies which try supporting the coup, as well as the subsidiaries (companies which are not in the list of Instituto Brasil 200, but whom its income goes to these companies indirectly)


*Disseminate the Boycott idea to influencers. We need names who have strenght to move the idea forward



*Track the Boycott results (related news, numbers etc)



*Discuss strategy ideas for the Boycott

*News from The Guardian - Brazilians call for boycotts of major companies that support Bolsonaro: https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/05/brazil-call-for-boycotts-major-companies-support-jair-bolsonaro


*[NEWS TEXT] “I’m trying to combat a feeling of impotence,” said Edwin Carvalho, 39, a journalism professor in the southern city of Florianópolis, who posted a message on a closed LGBT Facebook group with 320,000 members calling for a boycott of the Latin America-wide Smart Fit gym chain. Carvalho’s post was prompted by reports that Smart Fit founder Edgard Corona had shared videos attacking Rodrigo Maia, speaker of the lower house of congress, in the WhatsApp group of Brasil 200, a powerful business organisation. Supporters of the president are planning nationwide protests on 15 March and have flooded social media with memes attacking congress – and even proposing a return to military rule. Several members of Brasil 200 – including Luciano Hang, the outspokenly pro-Bolsonaro owner of the Havan department store chain – have expressed support for the anti-Democratic demonstrations. One investor, Otavio Fakhoury, even offered to pay for sound trucks for the demonstration. Pablo Corroche, 38, a teacher in Porto Alegre, cancelled his Smart Fit membership and no longer visits Havan. “We are going through an anti-democratic moment in Brazil and I won’t go along with this,” he said. Luiz Pimentel, 44, a public servant in Rio, said that when he went to cancel his Smart Fit membership, the couple in front of him were doing the same. “Business leaders are defending their own interests not the people. That’s why I chose to boycott not just Smart Fit but other companies too,” he said. Pedro Parente, 56, who owns an information company in Fortaleza, has also joined the boycott. “It’s like finding a company is using slave labour,” he said. “I have the right not to consume their products or services.

*[NEWS TEXT TRANSLATION] Through social media and Whatsapp, president's supporters posted images with attacks against the Congress, removal of Legislative commanders and reference to the use of Armed Forces in the movement. President Jair Bolsonaro himself forwarded his friends a video calling the population to go on streets in March 15th to defend him. The information was comfirmed to Folha by ex-deputy Alberto Frada (Federal District). The national president of OAB (Order of Attorneys of Brazil), Felipe Santa Cruz, said that is the act of Bolsonaro is comfirmed, it can open ways for an impeachment request. In one of the posts from Bolsonaro's supporters, the photo of generals Mourão and Heleno wearing military uniform appears next to another two militar men with the phrase: ""The generals wait for people's orders. OUT Maia and Acolumbre"" (presidents of Câmara and Senado, the federal legislative houses). Senator Soraya Thronicke said ""I am behind the scenes and I can speak with authority: do not doubt general Heleno"".

*[NEWS TEXT TRANSLATION] Smart Fit was one of the first victims. Sharedholder from Smart Fit and Bio Ritmo and one of Brasil 200's leaders, businessman Edgard Corona pays the price for sharing on Whatsapp videos of attacks on Câmara dos Deputados (Chamber Of Deputies), Rodrigo Maia. According to what was revealed by journalist Mônica Bergamo (Folha de São Paulo), Corona, besides sharing the videos, sustained boosting them. As published by The Guardian journal, 1st media to communicate the Boycott, it started in a closed Facebook group, with 320,000 members, directed to LGBT population. ""I'm trying to counter the feeling of impotency"", explained to the journal the inniciative's author, journalism teacher Edwin Carvalho. On Friday march 6th, the hashtag #MaderoNuncaMais (MaderoNevermore) turned into one of the most commented topics on brazilian Twitter.

*[NEWS TEXT TRANSLATION] Neither Heleno nor Mourão (military generals) went on social media to repudiate the use of their image on the pamphlet. It was incumbent on general Carlos Alberto Santos Cru, a Bolsonaro's former-ministry, the only repudiation of the association of Brazilian Army with the post with scammer slant.

*[NEWS TEXT TRANSLATION] On the forwarded messages, the president sends one vídeo with strong emocional appeal in which he is presented as a kind of Nation Savior. With the National Hymn on background, the video shows immages of the president being knife-stabbed, intervealed by phrases of worship on his personality. While sharing the vídeo, Bolsonaro also sent the text: ""March 15th. General Heleno/Captain Bolsonaro. Brazil belongs to us, not the same long-standing politicians""


*News from Congresso Em Foco - the announer's voice from the video that calls for anti-Congress act is from a coordinator from Embratur (Brazil's tourism public agency): https://congressoemfoco.uol.com.br/governo/locutor-de-video-que-chama-ato-anti-congresso-e-coordenador-da-embratur/


*[NEWS TEXT TRANSLATION] One of the vídeos shared on Whatsapp by president Jair Bolsonaro (no party) calling supporters to participate on an anti-Congress act was narrated by the Publicity and Propaganda Coordinator from Embratur, a federal autarchy. Silvio Santos Nascimento was nominated for the post on Jair Bolsonaro's administration. The information was revealed by Laura Jardim, from jornal O Globo. The fact that the speech was recorded by a person that fills a comissioned job in Bolsonaro's administration is one more evidence of the envolvement of the Planalto (Brazil's Executive Power) on the convocation of manifestations against Nacional Congress and Federal Supreme Court. [journalist Vera Magalhães's Twitter &gt; ] ""Here it is, the other video you shared before. The print over there.

*[NEWS TEXT TRANSLATION] ""Whoever says this is a popular movement against democracy is lying and is affraid of confronting brazilian population"", concluded the president. In spite of what he says, his supporters have been doing calls for the act with words of order, hashtags and virtual pamphlets that attack democratic institutions, and even reach the point of asking for military intervention and the imprisonment of Rodrigo Maia (DEM party), president of Câmara (Legislative Chamber). One of these materials use images of generals and insinuate that the Armed Forces wait the popular support to intervene.

*At 6m27s, journalist Vera Magalhães (Estadão journal and Roda Viva tv programme): ""I recieved on Whatsapp a message with a source ""**Jair Bolsonaro is sharing a video calling for manifestations along with the following text**"", and the source sent me a print, to prove **she really recieved from Bolsonaro, it has the Seal of Republic**, which is the avatar he uses on Whatsapp, **president's phone number**, which I collated on my personal agenda and saw **it was the phone number itself**. It is Republic's President sharing **an auto-laudatory**: it is constructed with **epic tunes, with national hymn on background**, to show that there is a call for act to people **go to the streets to defend the president"", who knows what from**. He shared this video and **another video** with a more rough production, with difference of hours (one during night and the another at the morning) and with a text **where he makes an invitation in behalf of General Heleno and Captain Bolsonaro, not President Jair Bolsonaro or Ministry Augusto Heleno**. **Mônica Berga, from Folha, menages to comfirm the other source** who recieved one of the videos (the rough one) and the message, which was former-deputy Alberto Fraga... **the news was not contested**


*At 9m12s~10m39s, listen the **video's audio"" (the more produced one) of **Bolsonaro calling for manifestations**


*At 13m24s, Leandro Demori (Intercept): ""the message (of the protest) is in a context of manifestations that will happen in March 15th. We cannot remove this from the context, it is not a video out of nowhere. **These manifestations are clearly anti-Congress**. Like 'these guys are hindering the country'. If there was no narrative of closing the STF (Federal Supreme Court) with a cable and a jeep, it is the same thing; the creation of a narrative telling the population 'look; the Myth wants to do, but these guys don't allow. So help us to crush these guys, so we do what we want to do without negotiating, without doing policy'


*At 13m58s Pedro Dória (Estadão, O Globo, CBN): ""The pieces of the context are important: **the story begins when general Augusto Heleno is on Palácio do Planalto** in a certain cerimony and is recorded by the official video from Palácio do Planalto itself. **He comments he considers that National Congress is blackmailing the Republic's President and that Bolsonaro should call people to the streets**. From then on starts an articulation on social media, mainly Whatsapp, **bolsonarist businesspeople saying that will put money to pay sound trucks etc. On the majority of the images that circulate** first on Whatsapp, then on Twitter, then on Facebook etc **it clearly appears** that 'look, this is a manifestation against the National Congress'. *The most extreme of these images** is an image that shows **the vice-president Hamilton Mourão, Heleno and another two generals from the government wearing national militar uniform, saying ' The generals wait for people's orders to arise, to organize against the National Congress, which is vetoing'**... Republic's President has the duty of preserving the independency the Three Powers and respect the Powers. In other words, **Republic's President do not call popular manifestations against none of the other Three Powers. Period. This does not happen in USA, France, anywhere. This happens in Venezuela**. Impersonality of the position: **Jair Bolsonaro is not 'person Jair Bolsonaro'** he is the President of Republic, **he is the Institution President of Republic**. He represents the Head of State of Brazil. **being patriot is not being bolsonarist**. When he makes and assign a **video in which the message is 'Jair Bolsonaro sacrificed himself for us', and then there is the scene of the knife-stab**, 'now you come prove that you are patriot', putting yourself alongside Jair Bolsonaro, he is breaking what the democracy was made-up to fight for, which is the idea that the Head of State's figure and the nation's figure merge. So **he breaks two fundamental principles of a liberal democracy that the brazilian regime is. And this, moreover, would open space for an impeachment due to breach of parliamentary decorum etc**.


*At 18m20s, Vera Magalhães (Estadão and Roda Viva):""**This is not the 1st time he attempts a manifestation for the government**, and this is a component that Bolsonaro has been using frequently, this movement to the streets, to pressure the institutions from inside out. **Last year there was an likewise violent call"", likewise against (as it seems, which was reported by the press), of **an act against the Supreme Court and the Congress**. **When people finally went to the streets, it turned out that the act was against the Congress and the Supreme. There was pixulecos (giant balloons of specific persons) of Rodrigo Maia, tomatoes on the ministries of Supreme Court, 'out STF, down with the scammers' etc**, with what context?: to pressure the Supreme for the reforms and act in accordance with what Bolsonaro expected.


*At 20m10s, Vera Magalhães (jornal Estadão e Roda Viva): ""what lies there is a dispute for budget, **a dispute for power** in a game between the Congress and the Executive Power, that the Congress wants all the time to restrain **Bolsonaro and he trying the streets to kick the door**"".


*At 21m42s Vera Magalhães (jornal Estadão e Roda Viva): ""**the group (from Whatsapp) MKT Bolsonaro exists since 2018: Marketing Bolsonaro. It includes** some of these **influencers**, people from **bolsonarist** websites, some **political analysts on market**, one Secretary from Bolsonaro's government, the **Secretary of Productivity from Ministry of Economy (Carlos da Costa)**, and **some investors** who had already been mentioned about the **bolsonarist digital militia**... **Otávio Fakhoury** had already been set as one of these guys from the digital militia, making difamation, using a website he affords to make difamation, including in order to take down the Ministry, and it is in this group where they discuss, talk down a lot about the Congress, with the presidency of a Secretary of the ministry Paulo Guedes, and then he **says 'I will afford as many trucks as necessary, I will send whoever it is to the streets**, because I won't allow they bring down this government. There is a white coup being built and I will not allow them to bring down this government'. So the coup/counter-coup stuff, the paranoia, is present in all the warp of this manifestation"".


*At 23m00s Vera Magalhães (jornal Estadão e Roda Viva): ""**Bernardo Custa** (one of the influencers included on the Whatsapp group MKT Bolsonaro), **posted on Twitter 'fuck it.

personalfinance,Effect of new personal loan on mortgage app/rates?,"I need to consolidate my $36k CC debt with a personal loan, but I also need to buy a house this year. (Need is subjective obviously, and I know I am throwing myself to the wolves here. I know my spending habits need to improve and I have a plan to address it.) My CC debt is on 3 different cards and I recently changed my monthly payment to $500/mo. (more than 2x my min req payment) but my credit score is decent (744) so I’ve been getting a number of personal loan offers. I would easily cut my interest rate in half, probably more. 

The problem is that I reeeeeeeally need to buy a house. I currently live with my father and don’t pay any rent, but I have taken on most of the other bills. The place is just too small for the both of us and the pets, especially since I work from home and have no home office. My father also makes 1/3 of what I make, so he’d eventually sell his current home and move in with me, wiping out his debt in the process but without much leftover. (i.e. nothing to contribute to a down payment on a new home.) Depending on where I buy that may also mean he has to find a new job which isn’t easy for someone in their early 60s, so getting rid of his debt eliminates a lot of potential unemployment risk. I’d basically be buying the house on my own.

I made a bunch of extra money in 2018-2019, most of which went to paying off my own credit cards. I put $10k aside as a potential down payment on a house though. After I get my bonus in the next few weeks, I should have $20k there. I know the most financially prudent thing to do is to use that money to pay off my CC but we desperately need more space, and I’m the only one that can make this happen. (as opposed to my father) 

If I pay off all of my CC debt with a 24-36mo. personal loan, what will that do to my credit score and/or my ability to get a good rate on a mortgage?

personalfinance,Need Advice for Auto Refinance,"Okay so back in Feb of 2018 I ended up buying a nice 2015 car for $30k @  4.24 interest. It was a 72 month loan and apparently for a used car that is an exceptionally good interest rate. I have $20k left to pay and 5 years remaining. The question is whether or not I could possibly push that interest rate down any further? My credit score at the time was around 750 and nowadays hovers around 788.. 

Has anyone been able to really make a difference on their auto refinance with an already low interest? I'm afraid to start calling around since hard inquiries take a toll on your credit score. Would it even be worth it?",finance
personalfinance,Making payments on deferred student loans.,"I have about 18,000 in federal student loans, which are half made up of direct subsidized stafford loans and direct unsubsidized stafford loans. I've been paying these off since 2016 when I graduated. This spring semester, I enrolled back to school part time, so I just received a notice that all of these loans are now in deferment status.

So, from my understanding, the unsub loans will accrue interest during this deferment period while the sub loans will not? I'd like to keep paying the loans and avoid unnecessary interest, but if some of these will just be paused without interest gains for the next 18 months, I'll happily take that. 

So my question is, should I call my loan service provider (fedloan) to have the unsub loans changed to not deferred status if I still want to make the payments and leave the sub loans alone until the period is over?",finance

personalfinance,Mortgage Refinance Scenario &amp; Question &amp; Help,"Good morning all,

Need help seeing whether it is good to refinance.

&amp;#x200B;

Started a 30-year fixed mortgage loan starting with 1st payment September 2019.

Interest 3.5%

Loan Amount : $754,738.62

Paid 6 months already.

Every month I pay $3,395.68. ($1200 principal / $2200 interest breakdown so far)

&amp;#x200B;

My question is, is it good to refinance now?

I am hearing interest rates have gone down (maybe historically low since whenever).

What would a good interest rate to refinance be good at? 3.0%, 2.75%, 2.50%?

&amp;#x200B;

The reason why I am also asking is, if I refinance, wouldn't that reset it back to 30-year; thus those 6 months that I paid (especially in interests) goes to waste?

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for any wisdom or help.

&amp;#x200B;

Feel free to ask me any questions as well.",finance
personalfinance,Need a plan or ideas of how to pay down CC debt,"Hi. I've had some awful spending habits and no budgeting skills, so therefore I have racked up a ton of CC debt. It's gotten to the point that my debt payments are as much as my rent or more. Below are my balances and costs. Looking for any guidance, tips, or ideas of how to pay this down a bit, since it has become unbearable. I have since begun improving my spending habits and really nailing down a budget.

Income: $87,000/year

Savings: $3k

Fixed Costs:

\- Rent: $1500 (1300 + 200 to park) Unfortunately live in a high cost of living area

\- Car payment: $350

\- Car Insurance: $114

\- Phone: $75

\- Utilities: $40ish

&amp;#x200B;

Balances:

\- CC#1: $12k @ 17% (was able to ask for a lower rate)

\- CC#2: $7.3k @ 21% 

\- CC#3: $2k @ 15%

\- WF Personal Loan: $11k @ 11% (the goal was initially to consolidate, but my spending habits were not fixed, therefore my CCs had a balance again )

\- Student Loan: $17.6 @ 4%

\- Car note: $18k @ 6% (Thinking of trying to trade in for a lesser used vehicle)

&amp;#x200B;

Last month debt payment: $1394 

&amp;#x200B;

I can get a loan from Payoff for about 14% interest rate, but I don't want it to lead to more of the same.

Also, I have begun coaching on the side to help with payments.

&amp;#x200B;

Will take any advice, please be as brutally honest as possible, as I need to correct my horrendous habits.

investing,“Buy the Dip” vs “Dont catch a falling knife”,"Okay guys, just because you are playing a money game with positive expected value doesn’t mean every investing quote applies to your market at any point in time.

The market in most online finance communities is “stocks”. Just randomly saying “buy the dip” can apply to commodities, bonds, even those new digital assets that shall not be named.

The reason stocks are so popular in self-directed investing communities is because they have an expectation to “go up to infinity” “on average”. Bonds are boring and commodities are seasonal and range bound. Commodities traders are in that market specifically because they are uncorrelated to each other. Stock market traders pretend a basket of stocks are uncorrelated, when tightly coupling through ETFs is very evident and general risk on risk off behavior shows the same thing.

The purpose for acknowledging other markets exist is because the most nuanced discussion I’ve seen on this sub and other personal finance communities is a distinction between buying the dip in a single stock, vs buying the dip in an index. And uh yeah thats not critical thinking! Your only purpose in life isnt discipline on how well you can dollar cost average in the same asset class for any reason.

Right now, this is not the time to buy the dip in the stock market. Maybe any dips in the US treasuries market!

The index dollar cost averagers are right about one thing: Forget about what the S&amp;P does on a daily basis as people are trying to “price in” what might happen. But do use your brain, ALL constituent companies are going to miss earnings targets and give ABYSMAL forward guidance, and that will happen. Each company’s gap down during earnings season will chisel away at the S&amp;P bit by bit. Consider buying the dip in equities AFTER earnings season. Right now its just catching a falling knife, and you - retail traders - are the only ones catching it.

Buying any dip in US treasuries right now would have *more* positive expected value. The Federal Reserve was already lowering target rates, before last week’s out of band 50 basis point cut. This is already expected to happen. The Federal Reserve’s other tool for stimulus is to actually buy US treasuries from investors *at a premium*. Forget about the boring interest rates, the PRICE of the bond itself is in the most epic bull market in history and there is no way off of this train. Even when interest rates go below zero, forget about all the reindeer games you play to “beat inflation” and just play hot potato with the bond’s price!

Treasuries + the bond market in general (aka credit market) is bigger than the stock market. It takes all the money in the world to print all time highs on US treasuries. Look at the volume, if you assume this isnt just HFT playing with other robots, then realize it has to be that everyone is selling stocks TO YOU. They feel lucky they can move this volume of shares at these prices because of the indoctrination to “buy the dip”. They are using that massive amount of money to own bonds, both for stability but under the prospect of selling them to the central bank, the biggest whale trader in the world. Nobody is holding these things till maturity, except the Fed with its infinite investment horizon. 

When retail blows its load on this first dip, who are they going to sell to? When major employers stop paying, then what? Remember these are just continual fast paced auctions, and both the bids and asks can simply be readjusted to a different range of numbers when all parties act on new information. The history and trends of prices, shown on a chart, have nothing to do with it. They dont have to “trend down” because the technicals say so. Anyway, I’m not here for “doom and gloom” I’m just saying dont be married to a position or an asset class. We already know all the stocks are overvalued and have collectively decided that “old” fundamental metrics dont matter. They didnt, that was entirely rational. But parties over, there is no way that revenues can keep up. So the party is in the bond market, buy those dips but over there.

personalfinance,Mortgage advice,"I am a 27 year old engineer with a very stable, but temporary government job in the Midwest. My contract ends in 4 years but I will very likely be renewing the contract - I will most likely spend my entire career at this job. However, of course I need to consider the possibility that funding will be in a different place in 4 years and I'll need to look for a new job (which would necessitate moving as my career offers no other options within my city).


I make $95,000/year and max out my 401(k), Roth IRA, and HSA. After deductions, I take home $3440/month of which $1000 (on average) is leftover and put into my savings. I currently spend $1000/month on rent.


I'm under contract on a house which cost $186,000. I have $60,000 in savings, of which $37,000 (20%) is going to down payment. I believe I've found a good lender - a local bank that friends of mine have had good experiences with. I shopped around for rates and their rates were the best by far. 30 year mortgage for 3.19% (3.284% APR) or 15 year mortgage for 2.79% (2.887% APR). Estimated total closing costs of less than $4000. The property tax is fairly high in this area so my total monthly payment would be $1060 for a 30 year or $1430 for a 15 year. The housing market in this area is extremely hot and has been for a long time. Houses are under contract within a few days of going on the market so I'm not particularly wary of getting stuck with a house I can't sell on the off chance I lose my job in 4 years.


So I think I'm in a good position to buy a house. I'm a little nervous as I'm very debt-averse and I've never bought anything more expensive than a used car but this seems like a good move (but if you disagree please tell me!). This post is partially just a sanity check to make sure I'm not doing something dumb.


However I can't decide between the 30 and 15 year mortgages. I understand that with such low interest rates it's (on average) better to get a 30 year and invest the difference in the stock market. But putting that money into equity seems a whole lot safer, especially right now. With a 30 year mortgage, my monthly payment would basically be the same as my current rent payment (for a much nicer place!). A 15 year mortgage would only cut my monthly savings of $1000 in half. I'll still have a large emergency fund after buying the house, and I expect consistent raises of ~$3,000/year plus cost of living adjustments so the 15 year will look even nicer in a couple years.


I'm leaning towards the 15 year mortgage. My home-owning co-workers think that's the way to go, but reddit tends to recommend 30 years.

investing,Goldman Sachs warns US markets will face further sharp falls,"[https://www.ft.com/content/d41b7aba-63a4-11ea-b3f3-fe4680ea68b5](https://www.ft.com/content/d41b7aba-63a4-11ea-b3f3-fe4680ea68b5) 

**The article is behind a paywall so here you go**:

Goldman Sachs has called time on Wall Street’s 11-year bull run, warning that the coronavirus outbreak and oil crash will send the market tumbling by almost 30 per cent from the record highs set last month. 

The Wall Street bank said the S&amp;P 500 will fall to 2,450 over the next three months, a 15 per cent drop from Tuesday's closing level and a 28 per cent tumble from the peak in February. Goldman's forecast suggests the US will enter a bear market, typically defined as a fall of at least 20 per cent from a recent high.  

“Both the real economy and the financial economy are exhibiting acute signs of stress,” said David Kostin, Goldman's chief US equity strategist. “We believe the S&amp;P 500 bull market will soon end.”   He said the “proximate causes include the global spread of the novel coronavirus and the 43 per cent collapse in crude oil prices.”  

Global financial markets have been shaken in recent weeks as investors attempt to determine the extent to which the Covid-19 outbreak will disrupt the economy. Equities have dropped sharply, corporate debt has taken a heavy blow and gauges of volatility have surged. Investors have sought shelter in havens — sending US bond yields to historic lows.  

Mr Kostin said in a note to the bank's clients on Wednesday that earnings per share of the large US companies listed on the S&amp;P 500 index will drop 5 per cent this year. This marks the second downward revision in as many months, as Goldman in February had projected no earnings growth for the S&amp;P 500 this year. Strategists at the bank expect earnings to fall by 15 per cent in the second quarter.  

The projected drop in earnings comes as crude prices are expected to drag on the energy sector. Oil tumbled sharply at the start of the week after Saudi Arabia launched a price war despite a hit to demand as a result of the coronavirus outbreak.

 Meanwhile, the drop in US government debt yields is expected to place pressure on US banks’ profitability. The yield on the US 10-year Treasury note has dropped below 1 per cent after the Federal Reserve last week delivered an emergency rate cut. Many investment banks expect further reductions, potentially back to crisis-era lows near zero. 

Goldman also said the decline in business activity and reduced consumer spending will hit companies across various industries.  

The bank expects the situation to improve markedly by the end of 2020, with earnings expected to jump 12 per cent in the final three months of the year, helping to drive a “fast rebound” in the S&amp;P 500 back to 3,200 — close to where it started the year. “A new bull market will likely be born later this year,” said Mr Kostin.  

“By year-end, economic and earnings growth will be accelerating, the fed funds rate will be at the zero lower bound, and the impact of any fiscal stimulus will be flowing through to consumers,” Mr Kostin said, pointing to Goldman's expectation that the Fed will cut rates to historic lows over the next two months.",finance

personalfinance,Preferred lender versus big bank lender,"Hi all, I've been obsessively browsing r/personalfinance the past few days. I finally made a Reddit account today to get your guys' advice about my specific situation. I know this is a question that has been asked over and over again, so bear with me.

Me and my husband are first time homebuyers in California, recently purchased a newly built condominium from a builder with a good reputation (""the largest builder in the world"", apparently). After extensively shopping for loans the past few weeks with \~10 lenders, we've narrowed it down to two lenders: the preferred lender, or \[Big Bank\] lender.

The preferred lender offers us a 10K closing credit, but is giving us a 3.50% interest rate. The big bank is offering us a 3.25% interest rate, and in the process of getting a ""pricing exception"" for us, which would give us 10K in lender credits towards closing costs (basically, to ""match"" the 10K closing credit of the preferred lender). The catch is that it takes up to 4 business days for the pricing exception to be officially approved, although we were told they are ""very confident"" it will be approved.

So at this point, we have locked that deal with the big bank, and have not locked a deal with the preferred lender. I know from a math standpoint, if the big bank pricing exception goes through, they are obviously the better choice. However, I have been given LOTS of info over the past few weeks about whether to go with a preferred lender vs. other lender. The preferred lender (and the sales agents for the home) have repeatedly told me that there's a chance that closing could be delayed if we don't go with the preferred lender. Closing is April 17th. For example, preferred lender told me: ""I have a friend in \[Big Bank\], and he says a 36 days closing would be tough to do, since they are swamped right now"". The big bank lender said there's ""absolutely no problem for us to make that closing date, because purchasing loans always have first priority"".

I feel like I've played middle man between competing lenders for the better half of a week now, that I'm burnt out and tired of playing the game of ""Who's telling me the truth and who's lying?""

Does anyone just have any general thoughts about all of this? What is the actual chance that the builder will try to sabotage closing date because they feel bitter about us not going with their preferred lender? Feeling overwhelmed.

And as a sidenote - I know this post comes off as super neurotic. I've been cooped up in my house for the better part of a week, dealing with lenders and other home buying stuff all day long.",finance

personalfinance,Help figuring out best refinance savings option!,"Hi personal finance,

I currently own a home with 3.75% interest on a 30-year fixes mortgage. I’m coming up on 4 years into the mortgage later this year. Mortgage is for $205k as I put down 20% upfront, so now I have about $189k left to pay.

Because interest rates are dipping, I’m interested in refinancing for a lower rate. My goal is to see if I can get 3% (or lower). 

Now, I’m very confused as to what my options are. Math is my weak area. Let’s say I call a lender who can give me my 3% based on market. What kind of money would I save if I were to do a 30-year paying the new lower payment? How about 30-year paying my current payment even though I have a new lower payment? Would it be even better to get a prorated mortgage for say 25 years instead? I’m very confused! 

I’m just trying to find a basic rundown of what the numbers look like for each scenario. My goal of the refinance is to pay less overall interest to save money in the long run. I can afford higher payments, but this home will turn into a rental in 5-7 years and plan to keep this house for like, ever, and so I’d like to keep leverage available, if that makes sense. 

Thanks all!",finance

investing,Why investors should remain invested,"While coronavirus warrants a more cautious market outlook, the risks to the upside and downside are beginning to look more balanced from here. Below are four considerations for why I think investors should remain invested:

1) The S&amp;P 500 closed today nearly 20% below its most recent high. While it's conceivable that things get worse from here, drawdowns of a much greater magnitude have occurred only a handful of times in history (see chart: [https://imgur.com/a/ZwFpC8y](https://imgur.com/a/ZwFpC8y)). The recent market moves remind me of the 2008 financial crisis, though I think the financial system is stronger today.

2) China is already getting back to work. While China experienced a sharp contraction in manufacturing activity in February, the economy has since stabilized and is beginning to recover from wide-spread quarantines and lockdowns (see chart: [https://imgur.com/a/AYcieBV](https://imgur.com/a/AYcieBV)).

3) The number of new infections is showing tentative signs of flattening out across major regions (see chart: [https://imgur.com/a/eIsn6cl](https://imgur.com/a/eIsn6cl)). Albeit, the U.S. may be at an earlier stage of this process.

4) A decisive and coordinated fiscal and monetary policy response is underway. We all know coronavirus is a health issue and that running deficits and lowering interest rates isn't going to magically create a vaccine. However, policymakers can help soften the economic blow and facilitate an even sharper rebound when the virus fades.",finance

&gt; GE credit default swaps, a measure of confidence in a company’s capacity to repay debt, were priced at 200.7 basis points on Wednesday, up 119% from 91.67 a week ago, according to data from Markit.

&gt; It was their highest level since December 2018, just after GE’s credit ratings were cut and investors worried its debt might become non-investment grade. A comparable credit default swap index of investment-grade companies is up about 60% over the same period. 

&gt; The maker of jet engines, power plants and other industrial goods is struggling to generate profit and cash flow after ill-timed acquisitions and poor strategy moves in recent years. GE said last week that coronavirus could cut first-quarter cash flow by $500 million. 

&gt; Culp told investors last week that GE is sensitive to interest rates. A 25 basis-point rate decline raises GE’s pension obligation by $2.3 billion, he said. Lower rates also increase GE’s liability on long-term care insurance policies.

&gt; The higher liabilities likely would cost GE billions, and it has limited funding to pay down debt, said John Inch, an analyst at investment firm Gordon Haskett in New York. 

&gt; Other analysts cautioned about reading too much into CDS prices, and said virus effects may dissipate by the time GE’s pension and insurance obligations are calculated this year.",finance

stocks,A few things to consider before selling stocks,"I believe the economic impact of COVID-19 will be sizable and sharp. However, I see the outlook for equities as more symmetric from here, especially given that markets have materially corrected. Below are a few reasons why I think it may be too late to start selling equities now. Of course, happy to hear dissenting views!

1. The S&amp;P 500 closed today nearly 20% below its most recent high. While it's conceivable that things get worse from here, drawdowns of a much greater magnitude have occurred only a handful of times in history (see chart: [https://imgur.com/a/ZwFpC8y](https://imgur.com/a/ZwFpC8y)). The recent market moves are reminiscent of the 2008 financial crisis, though I think the financial system and economy is on much stronger footing today.
2. The Chinese economy is already going back online. While China experienced a sharp contraction in manufacturing activity last month, the economy has since stabilized and is beginning to recover from wide-spread social distancing measures (see chart: [https://imgur.com/a/AYcieBV](https://imgur.com/a/AYcieBV)).
3. The number of new infections is showing tentative signs of flattening out across major regions (see chart: [https://imgur.com/a/eIsn6cl](https://imgur.com/a/eIsn6cl)). Albeit, the U.S. may be at an earlier stage of this process.
4. A decisive and coordinated fiscal and monetary policy response is underway. I think the impact of rate cuts in fairly limited in this situation, though fiscal policy could be more impactful given that it can put money directly in the hands of consumers. I see a large fiscal impulse creating a recipe for a sharp rebound when coronavirus fades.",finance

I am a W-2 employee with no dependents. My group contributes nothing toward retirement until I have been there for one year. As such, I was reading a bit about retirement planning, with the thought that I would open a Vanguard traditional IRA this year. I know it’s a good problem to have, but maxing out the yearly contribution will be easy and I would like to put away significantly more. 

Recently, I can across the SEP-IRA and people talking about starting a business as a Sole Proprietor.

I have about 30K in CC debt. 20K of that is on a 0% interest balance transfer card with the promotion ending in December 2020. This debt is mostly related to a period of unemployment, an international move, and some shopping problems that I've since gotten under control. 

My husband and I own our home (Mortgage: $1,700) and he currently makes 90K which is enough to cover all of our living expenses. I'm a stay at home mom and I currently work a few hours in my former career which covers my credit card minimum payments and a few other things related to our children. 

This summer, I'm starting grad school to get my dream job. I'll be making 100K+ in 2 years, but my work hours will obviously be slashed and I'm worried about making my minimum payments. With the added expense of childcare ($1,500 monthly), my husband's salary won't cover them (around $800 monthly). 

We will have to take out a loan to cover my tuition (70K for 2 years), but we could probably swing taking out a very minimum amount to cover additional living expenses, given my husband's salary. HOWEVER. Would it make sense to take out the maximum available in student loans in order to make big payments, or possibly pay off, my credit card debt? This would mean graduating with at least 100K in student loans. I'm not sure what interest rate I'll be offered on those, but it will be less than my credit card interest, right? 

Is this plan insane? I'm terrified of my CC debt, but tackling student loan debt feels manageable when we'll be making 200K combined in just 2 short years.",finance

He got behind in bills and in stead of asking me to move money (I am self employed and keep money in a business account. It has always been an option for me to move money and he knew that) he decided to take out multiple payday loans. We had the money, he just didn’t ask for help. I even offered on multiple occasions to move money over and he said no the account was fine. 

I don’t want any advice on him. I’m working through that and he has no control over any money anymore, at least for the time being. I plan on meeting with a financial advisor soon, and once we can afford it couples therapy. I’m still getting info on exactly how much but it’s about $5000 with varying interest rates  from 40-100%. I had a good credit score until recently because he missed three payments on his car (under both of our names). That’s how I figured out something was wrong. 

I have spent the last two days updating all bills (he inherited the house, my name is not on any of the utilities.) and getting his account in the green. I think I am going to close his back account and start fresh. 

I need advice on the best way to get rid of these high interest loans without draining my accounts. I have already moved a few thousand paying the late real estate tax, late bills, and just putting money in his account to avoid overdraft fees. Maybe transferring them to a 0% balance transfer card. My grandma offered to open one for me, her score is in the 800s. I hate having to do that though.

investing,Are we entering a secular period of corporate deleveraging?,"Hi All - it would be interesting to get people's macro thoughts on this.. 

We been in a secular debt binge for 30+ years. Corporate b/s have expanded significantly during this time. Conventionally, a typical cycle would be assuming we started in a recession; companies would delever their b/s - weaker companies die - things become cheap - productivity improves and so does growth - people spend - economy grow and confidence returns until we reach a phase where we can't grow anymore - so companies add debt to continue expanding economic growth - debt becomes unstainable and we go into the next recession also in the cycle with also get our usual interest rate adjustments. But, since the 08 crash - the system was never really cleared due to CB intervention and debt continued to balloon up. What I mean is - consumer debt was a problem in 2006-7, banks were the problem in 2008, and now the debt has been rolled up to a sovereign level. Its just been passed on.. 

Now, I don't have the exact figures on hand but debt to GDP has go up and this is a predominant factor driving growth in the last decade. worryingly, to fuel growth each time we borrow $1 we are adding less and less to economic growth..so, again I don't have exact figures.. In 2010 we borrowed $1 and added 30 cent to growth but on 2019 we borrowed that $1 and added 20 cent to growth and that's declined c30% over the decade.. so we are having less of an impact. But the point here is each time we add debt it's having a diminishing impact. 

Although IR are at an all time low - it doesn't mean those companies with geared b/s can continue - I mean if economic growth is slow or we head into a recessionary period which maybe long lasting based on current demand and supply shocks, surely those companies cash flow dry up and will struggle to service their debt. Sure they can renegotiate their debt borrowing terms but if lenders see no eco growth the risk premium of lending increases...

To do this, RDF2Vec first  creates ""sentences"" which can be fed to Word2Vec by extracting walks of a certain depth from the Knowledge Graph.

In addition to extract random walks and applying weisfeiler-lehman relabeling, as proposed by the original work, we provide 6 alternative walking strategies (and allow to combine several of them). A comparison of these strategies will be out soon!

Nevertheless, credit interest rates should be the least of their worries, considering that they are a result of defaulting on credit card bills that come with an extended grace period. Considering that they strategize their purchases, chances of defaulting are a rarity.

All that they need to do is adopt a few positive financial habits –

* **Choosing credit cards that have lower APR –** Make sure to approach credible credit card companies whose cards come with lower APR. It ensures that the attractive interest rate is minimum.
* **Make timely payment of the credit card bills –** Set reminders or opt for credit card bill payment via the NACH facility.
* **Pay the minimum outstanding amount in case of cash crunches –** Make the payment of the minimum outstanding amount as pre-determined by the NBFC in question. It ensures that the due amount does not draw interest rates despite defaulting.
* **Plan out purchases per the billing cycle –** Go for the high-end expenses towards the start of the billing cycle to make the most out of the total grace period cycle.

Make the necessary purchases on credit but plan your finances accordingly. Avoid incurring interest by repaying the credit availed and increase your purchasing power with ease.

At first glance I figured that the rates weren't really low enough to bother and then I remembered that for the rural development loan there's no PMI but instead they tack on a 1% upfront funding fee as well as an annual fee of 0.35% of the loan's balance. Am I looking at a true interest rate of 5.35%?

If I were to refinance to 3.5% from 5.35% I'd have significant savings I would think - how would PMI factor in? If I have $140k remaining on my loan balance how do they factor the 80% value threshold for where PMI goes away?

Is there anything I'm missing about whether or not now is a good time to refinance?

Edit: In looking at the data I may have misspoke - the 1% upfront fee would act more like an additional closing cost. So the true interest rate would be the 4% plus the 0.35%, giving me a real interest rate of 4.35%.

I don't know if that changes anything if I can get a 3.5% rate on a new 30 year or 3.2% on a 20 year",finance

I called my local bank to try to get a 15 year 2.75% fixed and they told me don't do it, just paying extra on my current mortgage is better. How can this be true? 

If I switch to a lower interest rate, and the mortgage is paid off in (8+15) only 23 years from when I bought the house isn't that by far the best scenario? What math could the mortgage broker be using to tell me it's not worth it to refinance?

oil,Inside Saudi Arabia’s Decision to Launch an Oil-Price War,"From [https://www.wsj.com/articles/saudi-russia-disclose-dueling-output-plans-amid-intensifying-oil-market-war-11583835347](https://www.wsj.com/articles/saudi-russia-disclose-dueling-output-plans-amid-intensifying-oil-market-war-11583835347)

Riyadh prepares emergency budget for oil at $12 to $20 a barrel; ‘It’s all about egos now’

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Some oil officials say they struggle to see the logic behind Saudi Arabia’s decisions. Others see the battle as tied to [Prince Mohammed’s recent efforts](https://www.wsj.com/articles/top-saudi-royal-family-members-detained-11583531033?mod=article_inline) to tighten his grip on power and raise his international clout, according to people involved in the OPEC talks. 		  
&gt;  
&gt;Russia’s failure to find common ground with Saudi Arabia and OPEC on  oil cuts was preceded by talks in early February between Riyadh and  Moscow that focused on the possibility of forging a broader, long-term  alliance. Under one scenario, Saudi Arabia would have sped up its  investments inside sanctions-hit Russia and backed the Kremlin’s  military efforts in Syria, according to people familiar with the matter. 		  
&gt;  
&gt;Ultimately, the crown prince didn’t commit to a deal, say the people  familiar with the matter, because he didn’t want to alienate the U.S.  Weeks later, roughly at the same time that Russia was refusing to  endorse the Saudi-backed plan to cut oil output, Mr. Putin was  initiating a rapprochement with Turkey, a Saudi foe, the people said. 		  
&gt;  
&gt;“It’s all about egos now, not about the oil market,” said a Saudi-government adviser. 		  
&gt;  
&gt;Meanwhile, Prince Mohammed saw the OPEC debate as a way to assert his  broad influence over the kingdom’s oil policies and to prove to his  older brother, Saudi energy minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, that  he could force Russia’s hand, according to people familiar with his  thinking. 		  
&gt;  
&gt;In a terse phone call to Prince Abdulaziz late Thursday, the crown  prince overruled his brother, who had agreed to a three-month production  cut with OPEC, and extended the proposed cuts through the end of the  year, these people said. 		  
&gt;  
&gt;The crown prince ordered the minister to force OPEC to adopt the  decision—even if that meant risking any hope that Russia would join in,  they said. 		  
&gt;  
&gt;Now the kingdom is pursuing a strategy of undercutting its rivals by  drowning markets with cheaper oil—a move that has a tendency to  backfire, say longtime market watchers. 		  
&gt;  
&gt;On Saturday, the Saudi energy ministry told Aramco officials that  instead of cutting production, they should pump more oil and lower the  price. Saudi Arabia soon spread the word throughout the market. “It was  the Saudi declaration of war against Putin,” said a senior Saudi  official. 		  
&gt;  
&gt;Within hours, officials at the finance ministry were tasked with  preparing a budget scenario that envisions benchmark Brent crude prices  dropping into a $12-$20 a barrel range. All Saudi ministries were also  asked to cut their spending significantly to prepare for this scenario. 		  
&gt;  
&gt;But the strategy has backfired before. 		  
&gt;  
&gt;In 2014, then-Saudi oil minister Ali al-Naimi persuaded OPEC to pump  at will to compete with U.S. shale producers. His rationale was that the  cartel’s members had the ability to produce at extremely low costs. But  after the price of Brent crude fell below $28 a barrel in early 2016,  the [Saudi royal family fired him](https://www.wsj.com/articles/saudi-arabias-powerful-oil-minister-ali-al-naimi-is-fired-1462632035?mod=article_inline).  His successor, Mr. Falih, negotiated a pact between OPEC and Russia to  cut production in the first OPEC+ deal. Within months, oil prices more  than doubled. 		  
&gt;  
&gt;The move to depress prices also missed its mark in the 1980s and led  to a period known in oil circles as the “Lost Decade.” In 1986, OPEC  faced competition from rising North Sea production. Saudi Arabia’s  delegation was so upset about OPEC members flouting the group’s  production agreements that it unleashed a flood of oil that sank prices  for a prolonged period. 		  
&gt;  
&gt;Eventually, Saudi Arabia backtracked and cut production, but the move  wasn’t a complete failure, as it helped score a political victory  against the Soviet Union. Riyadh had been backing insurgents battling  Russia in Afghanistan—many of whom would later found al Qaeda. As the  oil price fell to around $30 a barrel, Russia faced a budget crisis that  contributed to food shortages and an end to its war in Afghanistan. Its  then-leader Mikhail Gorbachev retreated from Kabul and launched the  restructuring of Russia under his perestroika policy. 		  
&gt;  
&gt;Russia is better prepared to weather low oil prices than in the past.  Oil is now accounts for less than a third of budget revenue. The  country has also accumulated massive reserves. The Russian finance  ministry said Monday that it could withstand 10 years of prices at $25  to $30 a barrel. 		  
&gt;  
&gt;Still, some Russian producers say the oil-market war is excessive. 		  
&gt;  
&gt;“I’m in shock. This is a very unexpected, irrational decision to put  it mildly,” Leonid Fedun, vice president of Russian private producer  Lukoil was reported as telling Russian newspaper the Bell. Russian oil  companies would like to increase production, he said, but that won’t  make up for losses from falling prices. 		  
&gt;  
&gt;The mood is more somber in Saudi Arabia, which needs oil prices over  $60 a barrel to balance its budget, according to Saudi officials. The  kingdom is now contending with its own coronavirus outbreak, moving  Monday to suspend all air travel with many of its neighbors. 		  
&gt;  
&gt;Saudi Arabia’s national oil company Aramco fell about 7% to 27.95  riyals ($7.45) a share on the Saudi domestic exchange Monday. The Saudi  price decrease has “literally burned all global energy investors,” said a  Saudi official. “\[Saudi Aramco\] Won’t sell a share to foreigners  again,” he said, referring to the [Crown Prince’s plan to list Aramco internationally](https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-the-saudi-aramco-ipo-came-back-to-life-11574418637?mod=article_inline).",energy

personalfinance,Loan Calculations Help,"Hi Community,
Can anyone help me with the math to figure out the total loan, interest, and monthly payments for a vehicle? I’ve done research and the equations but am still getting a little confused if my numbers are right. I don't like the website calculators for I feel they aren't accurate.  I’d like to get the math down before heading back into dealerships to negotiate.



Here is an example below:
1.	Used Vehicle 2017 Jeep Grand Cherokee 
2.	Mileage: 21,600
3.	Remainder of Warranty 3 year/36,000 miles
4.	Price: 24,999
5.	Trade: $1000



Dealer wrote the numbers on paper for the offer:
24,000 minus (Trade) 1,000 = 23,000
Plus (Tags) 380 and (Tax, PA 6%) 1320 = 1,700
23,000 + 1,700 = 24,700 Total



My credit is good but don’t know my APR rate yet, waiting for FCU to see what I can get. So, for arguments sake I did the math for 4.19, 4.99, and 5.90 interest rates. The steps are listed below:



Step 1. Rate to decimal example: 
1.	4.19 = .0419
2.	4.99 = .0499
3.	5.90 = .0590



Step 2. Divide by 12 payments for the year
1.	.0419/12 = .0035
2.	.0499/12 = .0042
3.	.0590/12 = .0049



Step 3. Multiply by loan amount….is this before or after a down payment? What I’ve been doing is subtract the down payment from the Total, so 24,700 or off 24,000? Example 6,000 down payment for loan of 18,700.
1.	.0035 x 18,700 = 65
2.	.0042 x 18,700 = 79
3.	.0049 x 18,700 = 92



Step 4. Add 1, to the power of the loan duration, Ex 5 years, so 60 months
1.	.0035 + 1 = 1.0035^60 = 1.233
2.	.0042 + 1 = 1.0042^60 = 1.286
3.	.0049 + 1 = 1.0049^60 = 1.341



Step 5. Divide 1 by number 
1.	1/1.233 = .81
2.	1/1.286 = .78
3.	1/1.341 = .75


Step 6. Minus 1
1.	1 - .81 = .19
2.	1 - .78 = .22
3.	1 - .75 = .25



Step 7. Divide step #3 by step #6 to get monthly payment
1.	342.11 a month
2.	359.10 a month
3.	368.00 a month



Summary:
1.	4.19 interest rate on 18,700 loan looking at 342.11 a month for 60 months, 1,826.60 extra for interest over life of the loan, 5-year overall payment of 20,526.60, with down payment included 26,526.60




2.	4.99 interest rate on 18,700 loan looking at 359.10 a month for 60 months, 2,846.60 extra for interest over the life of the loan, 5-year overall payment of 21,546.00 with down payment included 27,546.




3.	5.90 interest rate on 18,700 loan looking at 368.00 a month for 60 months, 3,380.00 extra for interest over the life of the loan, 5-year overall payment of 22,080, with down payment included 28,080.00.





Is this the correct math? Or do you subtract the down payment from the original 24,000? Trying to get a ballpark of what my total down payment, total loan, and monthly payments can look like. I want to tighten up my math before going back to the dealer, to do the numbers on my own, but want to do it correctly. Any feedback or corrections on this would be greatly appreciated.

We havent even started yet with that drop, just barely touched the 200wma on spx. If your plan is to 'buy the dip' you better be having very deep pockets, because if fed wont be able to throw enough freshly printed bills into that fire to put it out for some time, youll find yourself amidst a pretty impressive blaze.

Do not catch a falling knife. We are free falling into a recession, possibly depression. Save your cash, you are going to need it.

Also, research into bank of Japan. They've done exactly what the fed is doing now, and then look where their stock market ended up since 90's.

I’m sitting on a fair bit of cash and I’m torn on whether to keep buying or wait til the market dips another 10-20% if it has the same bottom on it that some of the previous major recessions have had. Banks like Wells Fargo are at half of what their peak was before this all start, and in ‘08 they hit as low as a quarter of what they were previously worth. I’m tempted to think the fed will try and fit in one more cut which will hurt banks, and the coronavirus doesn’t seem to be going anywhere in the next couple months. 

I understand speculative investing and trying to time the market can be fruitless and you’re often better off just dumping money in and waiting, but the market has been in a free fall and doesn’t seem to be stopping in the next 30-60 days. Getting prices at another 20-30% lower than they are now can go a long way for a 23 year old.

Our current household income is $114K in NYC and will be $141K. We're both 27 years old. Here's a summary of where we're at (this is both of our details combined):

* Student Loans (Gov't): $29.7K including:
   * 6.8%: $9K
   * 4.66%: $6.6K
   * 4.41%: $3.3K
   * 3.86%: $6.7K
   * 3.61: $2.1K
   * 3.15: $2K
* Emergency Fund: $2K
* 401K Savings: $46.5K

We don't have any other debt. Together, we're making a $750 payment to our student loans with the excess of the payment going toward our 6.8% loans. I'm still wondering if we should try to refinance our loans to get a lower interest rate, but I've heard we shouldn't do that because they're gov't loans. One other plus is that since my husband is in grad school, we're able to throw his $450 directly at his 6.8% loans without having a minimum payment on the other loans.) Should we still consider refi'ing?

We both put 12% in our 401Ks which we are planning to decrease soon. We realize our emergency fund is low, but we've been targeting our student loan debt and paying my husband's grad school tuition each semester to avoid taking out grad school loans.

When I first start my job, I'm thinking my plan should be to aggressively fund our emergency fund until we get about $10K, but I'd also like to open a Roth IRA and I've heard Charles Schwab is one of the best. (Separately, we are planning to purchase our first home in two years so we'd ideally like to start saving for a \~$30K down payment.)

One other thing I have to think about is where to roll over my current $25K 401K. My new employer doesn't match (so unfortunate); they offer either 401K or Roth 401K with potential profit sharing at the end of the year, but that's not guaranteed. My bank (Chase) suggested I roll it into a Traditional IRA with them, but my husband is thinking it's better to roll it over to my employer since they will likely cover more fees than if I were to move it to Chase. Is this generally the recommendation?

Does this plan sound good? Please let me know if there are any other things to keep in mind! Thanks in advance!",finance

Instead of pushing that $500 billion directly into the market, they could have offered a 2% match on all market contributions until the $500 billion runs out.  Make this 2% a refundable tax credit at the end of the year.  Sells are subtracted from your contribution total.

personalfinance,How to avoid being scammed!,"More and more, I’m seeing people complain about potential scams and what info was giving out. First, be skeptical! Sounds too good to be true, it’s most likely is. Even if they call from a trusted caller ID like your bank name, insurance agent etc. These can be easily spoofed! So if someone immediately starts asking for personal information from you after calling, ask what the reason for the call is. If there explanation is overly complicated or something that seems unlikely - end call. But if you’re not sure, say you’re driving and you’ll call them back. Then call a number you know to be the actual institution and ask if they still need that info. If your bank/service provider has no idea what you’re talking about, be thankful that was as far as it got. 
A lot of scams are not as complicated as you might think. Typically, they aren’t creating ss cards and fake ids to match the sensitive info you might have provided to open accounts in person. I would say 80% of scams are done by trying to get the victims to send payments directly to them (Gift cards?? Why would you’re insurance agents prefer you pay in $25 Walmart gift cards) or get into your online banking profile. Even if they don’t ask for your username/password outright, they might ask for typically online security questions like ‘moms maiden name’ or ‘first pet name’. Or they might have said they just sent you a code and they need you to tell them. They are actually logging into your accounts and having you get passed the two factor authentication. So don’t do it! Almost all institutions will have a way to access your accounts without having to access it using your personal log in. If you fear that they might have info to enter your online profile, stop and immediately reset *both* your username and password, while you’re at it, change your security questions. 
I’m assuming this is all info you’d liked to believe you know. But just take a second to ask yourself, “are my usernames/passwords for my accounts secure?” Are they same as your social media accounts? Change it. Are more than one the same? Change it, if they have one they could potentially access and account you didn’t even discuss. The inconvenience of having to remember multiple login information is well worth the peace of mind. Take a moment to also share this info with friends and family, especially if they’re older. They might be like this is how business is done now and they should now this as well! Stay safe guys!!

Edit: also share any tips you might have!",finance

**Article behind a paywall so here you go**:

In a week that brought the wildest market swings since the financial crisis, Thursday hammered investors with something crazier -- a 10% drop in the Dow, the end of the longest bull market on record and the biggest sell-off since 1987’s Black Monday.

President  Donald Trump finally offered some attempt at fiscal stimulus, but the measures fell flat. The European Central Bank took a stab by easing capital constraints and boosting liquidity, and losses only deepened.  Not even an unprecedented plan for $5 trillion in bond-buying from the Federal Reserve could mollify investors rattled by the growing likelihood that the coronavirus will plunge the global economy into recession.

At the end of the day, U.S. stocks smouldered 27% below records set barely three weeks ago. Europe’s benchmark index suffered its worst day in history. Brazil’s Ibovespa tumbled as much as 20% at one point, extending this year’s loss to almost 50% in dollar terms.  Canada’s main gauge was off more than 12%, it’s worst day since 1940.

Ten-year Treasury yields erased declines and inched higher as policymakers’ liquidity pledge recalled the quantitative easing used during the financial crisis. Oil and precious metals fell, with palladium sinking more than 20%.

The  S&amp;P 500 wiped out all its gains since the end of 2018. Now investors are trying to guess at the effectiveness of policymakers’  measures to curb the spread of the coronavirus and limit its economic damage. Trump’s travel ban and tepid fiscal measures failed to impress most observers. Spirits were further damped by new bans on public gatherings in the U.S. and professional sports leagues’ move to suspend operations.

“Markets likely need more. More innovation from central  banks, more targeted help for the most vulnerable parts of the economy  -- and action from fiscal authorities to stop this transitory shock from developing into a more prolonged insolvency crisis,” said Seema Shah, a  global investment strategist for Principal Global Investors. “Emotion  is now driving markets.”

“We need to see what is effectively a ‘declaration of war’ against the virus and full support to offset the economic damage that war will cost,” said Peter Tchir, head of macro strategy at Academy Securities  LLC. “Whatever has gone on this week, it’s not a liquidity crunch.”

Meanwhile, signs that companies in the hardest-hit industries were [drawing down credit lines](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-12/dash-for-cash-is-on-as-corporate-titans-draw-down-credit-lines) to battle the effects of the virus on their businesses added to anxiety.

*Here is an opinion article from* ***Bloomberg*** *calling for the shut down of financial markets. I do not necessarily agree but I wondered what people thought of the concept. The article is behind a paywall so here you go:*

The U.S. should temporarily close the nation's financial markets, maybe for a week or more, just as we did in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11.

We're quickly realizing just how drastically daily life is about to change,  at least for a few weeks. We've seen similar dramatic disruptions in  China, South Korea, Italy and other European countries as they curtail social activities to slow the spread of the coronavirus.

A major challenge is helping the public understand the severity of the problem we face and getting people to take these steps.  This is hard for the public to understand because of how unlikely it is that most Americans personally have the virus or know someone who does,  even if the number of confirmed cases so far is understated by a factor of 10. But we've seen in Italy just how quickly that can change, as that country went from 79 confirmed cases to more than 10,000 in just three weeks. To prevent the U.S. health-care system from being overwhelmed in the next few weeks, it's important that America take radical mitigation steps today.

Closing important institutions sends a critical signal to the public about what sorts of changes to their own behaviour they should make. We've already seen the National Basketball Association suspend its season, the cancellation of many large events -- even the  U.S. Capitol building is being closed to the public until April 1.  Corporations are adopting work-from-home policies to the extent that they can. Colleges and universities are shifting to online-only instruction and closing campuses. Cruise-line operators are suspending service for 60 days.

With all of the extreme measures already being taken, it's time to go all the way. Better to shut down most of the physical economy for three weeks rather than shut down a moderate amount of the physical economy for three months.

This would entail the need for a significant policy response from the federal government, including widespread virus testing at no cost to the public, and hundreds of billions of dollars of aid in the form of cash handouts or loans to workers, households and businesses.

But while we do that, we also should close financial markets. Credit conditions and liquidity have deteriorated rapidly in the past few weeks, and investors are trying to operate with even less near-term clarity than they had during the depths of the 2008 financial crisis. How should stocks and bonds trade if everyone's going to be hunkered down for a few weeks except for going to the grocery store or hospital? Additionally, with volatility this high,  speculation about possible government stimulus and rescue efforts raise the risk of significant amounts of insider trading and market manipulation. Better to bring things to a halt for a brief period so we can focus on the policy response, making sure families and individuals are healthy and safe. That seems like the only realistic way of preventing the panic from spiralling out of control.",finance

Schools are closing. Businesses are closing. Disneyland is closed. Social distancing is being enforced. 

All of these events are making the stock market tank, but this is what’s going to contain the coronavirus and lower infection/death rates much like what happened in South Korea. 

Once the virus is contained, what we then need to worry about is the recession. The stock market will no longer crash these insane amounts but will trickle downwards for the duration of recession. 

This is my amateur reasoning why I believe we are not at the bottom yet.

personalfinance,Make loan payments or save up?,"Amidst the fears over the virus and the severe decline of the stock markets, I am concerned over the economy and not sure what to do. Maybe I’m over reacting, maybe I’m not. Only time will tell. I guess if I felt like I had more job security, I would be feeling better, but I only started 2 months ago and if shtf, I would be one of the first to go. We had a meeting today over the virus and how we would handle it. Few things were said and it didn’t make me feel any better. With that being said, I don’t know if I should continue to make payments on my student loans or save my money in case things go real south. My current financial situation is: 

I have about 15k in federal loans and 15k in private. My mom has been paying off my private loans for a few years now starting when I was in school. I graduated in December. I started with 20k in federal loans, but brought it down to under 16k since December, paying $1400 a month or $700 a paycheck. I am still in my grace period and probably will be for another 3-4 months so no interest is being accrued and my monthly payments would be around $250 a month so I’m already ahead of schedule. 

After this paycheck, I will have $3,104  in my savings and $3,155.56 in my checking. I have about $1000 in cash. 

I get paid tomorrow and I’m not sure if I should make a payment on my loan, or hold onto my money until at least I enter repayment. 

I live with my parents so I don’t pay rent or bills. 

I am 24 years old. I have never been in this situation where I had bills to pay and worried about the economy and my job. I don’t know what to do or how to handle this. Like I said, maybe I’ve over reacting, but I’d rather have the information and advice for a potential situation than be in it with no knowledge as how to handle it. Thank you",finance

personalfinance,"Coronavirus Megathread: Resources, discussion, and your questions","Given the number of requests we've had to post a megathread along with the volume of similar threads being submitted, we're consolidating future general discussion on this topic here.

**We will continue to make updates to this post.**

# Stimulus checks (Minor updates April 15th)

Quick update:

The IRS has a portal where non-filers can enter their payment information to get a stimulus check, for filers to check payment status, confirm their payment type, and enter direct deposit information:

**https://www.irs.gov/coronavirus/economic-impact-payments**

**Note that the IRS is only updating payments status once per day. Don't wreck yourself checking every five minutes.**

---

The CARES Act authorizing relief/stimulus payments directly to individuals has been passed into law.

For non-dependent individuals, you are entitled to $1,200 if your AGI (Adjusted Gross Income) is below $75,000. For married couples filing jointly, it is $2,400 if your joint AGI is below $150,000. Taxpayers with dependent qualifying children will receive $500 per qualifying child (16 or younger, the rules are based on the child tax credit).

If your AGI is above the income threshold of $75,000 or $150,000, you will be entitled $5 less for every additional $100 of income above that threshold until the amount is fully phased out. For example, if you are single and without kids, the potential maximum amount of $1,200 is completely phased out once your income hits $99,000. If you are married with two young children then the maximum payment of $3,400 is completely phased out once your joint income hits $218,000.

Prior years' tax returns are being used to calculate each person's stimulus payment. If you filed your 2019 tax return already, that will be used. If not, then your 2018 tax return will be used. If you have not filed taxes for 2018 or 2019, you should do so as soon as possible to secure your eligibility for a prompt payment. Finally, if your 2020 income and status would allow you to receive you a larger payment, you will have to wait until you file in 2021 for the 2020 tax year, and you will receive the difference as a credit on your 2020 tax return.

Basically, you will get to keep the payment you receive and if you receive a smaller payment than your 2020 income would allow, you'll get a credit when you file your 2020 taxes.

**How will I get paid?**

If you received your tax refund by direct deposit into a single bank account, your relief payment will be deposited to the same account. If you did not receive your refund by direct deposit, or if it was deposited to more than one account, a physical check will be mailed to you at the address on your tax return. If you have not filed taxes, it is likely that the IRS will attempt to get your address from other agencies, like the Social Security Administration or the Department of Veteran's Affairs.

**What if I am a dependent?**

Feels bad, man.

It's worth noting that eligibility is based on your dependency status for 2020, so if you were claimed as a dependent in 2019 and can't be claimed as a dependent in 2020, you should get the $1,200 (or the lower amount if your income is high), just not until they file their 2020 return.

Finally, it's important to know that dependency status is not elective. You are either a dependent or you are not a dependent according to IRS rules.

**Is this just an ""advance"" on my tax refund?**

No. Assuming you're eligible, the money is a credit and not an advance on money you would have been owed already.

**What if I am sent an amount that is higher than my 2020 income would allow?**

There were some initial reports that the excess would come out of your future tax refund, but the consensus seems to be that you get to keep the money.

According to [this article from CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/27/politics/stimulus-payments/index.html):

&gt; And those who make more this year than last would not have to pay back any stimulus money they receive if they end up exceeding the thresholds. The payments would not be subject to tax, and those who owe back taxes would still get a check.

The [Washington Post has a similar statement](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/business/coronavirus-stimulus-check-calculator/).

**The IRS does not have my direct deposit information. What can I do?**

&gt; [In the coming weeks, [the US] Treasury plans to develop a web-based portal for individuals to provide their banking information to the IRS online, so that individuals can receive payments immediately as opposed to checks in the mail.](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/economic-impact-payments-what-you-need-to-know)

# Stock market turbulence

It's very natural to be feel concerned when there's a large drop in the stock market, especially after such a long period of growth, but it's important to keep perspective and avoid making rash decisions.

First, take a deep breath. Market downturns are not uncommon or unusual. [Between 1980 and 2017, there were **11 market corrections and 8 bear markets**.](https://institutional.vanguard.com/VGApp/iip/site/institutional/researchcommentary/article/NewsPerspectiveMktDownturns)

[Trying to time the market rarely turns out well](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unFn-ddtqiM&amp;t=4) and most people trying to enter or exit the market based on emotion, gut feelings, and everyone's predictions end up doing far worse than if they had simply continued business as normal. **[Stick to your plan and stay the course.](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/2jbtyu/investment_pro_tip_stay_the_course/)**

To quote Warren Buffett: **[""to buy or sell on current news is just crazy""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yaXmmaEs-hU&amp;t=24)**.

Don't make an emotional decision, don't try to predict where the market is headed in the short run, and make decisions for the long run. You're investing for decades, not trying to predict the Dow Jones or S&amp;P 500 next week, next month, or even next year.

# Being financially prepared and practicing sound finances

1. [Budget your money and reduce expenses.](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics#wiki_step_0.3A_budget_and_reduce_expenses.2C_set_realistic_goals) Fundamental to a sound financial footing is knowing where your money is going. Budgeting helps you see your sources of income less your expenses. You should minimize your expenses to the extent practical.

2. [Build an emergency fund.](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics#wiki_step_1.3A_build_an_emergency_fund) An emergency fund should be a relatively liquid sum of money that you don't touch unless something unexpected comes up. For most people, 3 to 6 months of expenses is good. A larger emergency fund may be warranted if your income is variable or uncertain. If you're in credit card debt, aim for one month of expenses and focus the rest of your money on paying down debt.

3. Don't check out of your finances. Continue following the steps in [""How to handle $""](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics) as best possible starting at the beginning of the flowchart. If you can't make rent, contact your landlord. If you have trouble paying your mortgage, see below. If there are bills you can't pay, research your options and contact the company. Simply not paying a bill without any communication is almost certainly not your best option.

4. There's more good stuff you should be doing in this [video from Bogleheads](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Video:_Start_with_a_Sound_Financial_Lifestyle) and the [PF wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/index).

# Refinancing

[If you're in the market for refinancing your mortgage, it may be worth considering](https://clark.com/homes-real-estate/when-should-i-refinance-mortgage-2020/), but if you don't have a healthy emergency fund and extra cash, you may not want to refinance right now due to the up-front costs.

# Federal student loans (Minor update on April 10th)

The CARES Act has some provisions to aid people with federal student loans including:

- Borrowers will be able to pause payments on federal student loans until September 30th, 2020.
- There will be no interest charged against your federal student loans until September 30th, 2020.
- Involuntary collection of defaulted student loans via garnishment of wages, social security, and tax refunds is also being suspended.

Key points:

- Private student loans are not affected.
- [If your loan is federally-held, you do not need to take any action to suspend payments. Your federal student loan servicer will suspend all payments automatically. You do not need to contact your student loan servicer.](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/blog/what-you-need-to-know-about-student-loans-and-coronavirus-pandemic/)
- If your loan is *not* federally-held (i.e., federal student loans held by commercial lenders), do not assume you can pause payments without contacting your servicer. You may want to look into income-driven payment plans.

Read https://myfedloan.org/borrowers/covid/ for more information and updates.

# Federal tax payment deadline, filing deadline, and IRA deadline extended to July 15th (Updated on March 28th)

Key points:

1. [Both the filing deadline and the payment deadline are now being extended to July 15th.](https://twitter.com/stevenmnuchin1/status/1241002750483324930)

  [The IRS has also stated that the deadline for making contributions to your 2019 IRA is now July 15th.](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/filing-and-payment-deadlines-questions-and-answers)

2. **State deadlines are not affected by the extension**, but some states are providing extensions (the terms may differ, though). [The AICPA is maintaining a summary of states' filing and payment guidance due to Coronavirus.](https://www.aicpa.org/content/dam/aicpa/advocacy/tax/downloadabledocuments/coronavirus-state-filing-relief.pdf)

3. If you are receiving a refund, you should probably still file earlier.

# Many mortgage owners will be eligible to have their mortgage payments reduced or suspended for up to 12 months (New on March 20th)

Key points:

1. [The move covers about half of all home loans in the U.S. — those guaranteed by Fannie and Freddie. But regulators expect that the entire mortgage industry will quickly adopt a similar policy.](https://www.npr.org/2020/03/19/818343720/homeowners-hurt-financially-by-the-coronavirus-may-get-a-mortgage-break)
2. You can't just stop paying your mortgage. Contact your servicer to find out if you are eligible for this or if your servicer has adopted a similar policy.

# Retirement account changes (Updated on March 29th)

Key points:

1. The CARES Act provides an additional way for people to access cash by allowing the penalty-free withdrawal of up to $100,000 from qualified retirement accounts including IRA, 401(k), 403(b), 457(b), and several other types of accounts. It is also now easier to borrow money from 401(k) plans and the maximum loan size has increased to $100,000 from $50,000. Any loans due in 2020 are also being extended.

  In addition, some other rules related to retirement plan distributions have been suspended or modified.

  For details and **numerous warnings** about why you should try to avoid making early withdrawals, read these articles:

investing,Would you buy bond ETFs after this week's 8%-ish drop?,"Would you buy bond ETFs after this week's 8%-ish drop?  That is, if you had a big lump sum and you want some bond exposure with part of it.

I was planning to build a new, long term, stock/bond portfolio with a lump sum.  I was planning on starting next week, and wow, has it been interesting just watching markets leading up to this.

For my equity allocation, I was planning on averaging into stocks over the next few months, and hope the market keeps getting pummeled until the exact date I stop buying :P

But I'm not sure how to approach the bond part.  I was planning to just put it all into a broad market bond ETF right away.  Let the yield of almost 0% start trickling in.  And if stocks keep getting destroyed, bonds are ""supposed to"" go up, and I'd move some bonds into stocks (rebalancing).

But then I just watched the bond market go bonkers this week, as interest rates got cut, and everybody freaked about about the virus and recession.  If I had bought the bond ETF last week after it shot up around 5%, I would have then watched it drop 9% a few days later.

A 9% loss in bonds would mean less money to rebalance into stocks as they drop.

So I guess I'm worried if stocks drop more, bonds might drop with them, and maybe I'm better off with cash?  Or a 2% savings account.

What would you do with a lump sum that you're supposed to put into fixed income right now?

Sorry that was long!",finance

personalfinance,Potentially Big Tax Liability for 2020 (US),"For starters, this is a throwaway. I own a business in Mississippi that has had a moderate level of success since its inception a few years ago. We (my wife and I) have slowly grown the business over this time and each year the expenses (mostly construction/ leasehold improvements) have been large enough to offset our gross income so that there is enough left over for payroll, rent, utilities and an okay salary for our lifestyle. However, for 2019, we no longer had a lot of those expenses and we managed to net 86k between Q3 and Q4. The 86k basically was the profit for the business after we paid everything, including our salary; and we have no outstanding debt for the company. Fast forward to today when we met with our CPA to pay the 2019 tax liability, which was roughly 13k (8800 Federal, 4200 State). It stings, but thankfully we had it in the account and had mentally prepared for that.

Here is the thing though, we are currently on track to have our best year yet. In the current projections, we are looking at potentially netting 160k this year. This means next year when Mar 15 rolls around, our tax bill will also be huge. So, what are some suggestions to ameliorate some of this tax liability? We don't really want to just take additional salary because we make enough for our own comfort. Plus, that would just shift the taxes from the company to us personally.

We have started offering health insurance to our full time employees. We could set up some type of pension/savings account, but what kind? The company is set up as a single man LLC, but we can file our taxes as an S corp. Our accountant recommended setting up an investment account for the company, but what kind?. My wife and I have a personal investment account through Vanguard but we aren't really sure how it would be different for a business. Looking forward to your thoughts.",finance
Bitcoin,Crisis of Trust,"The behavior of this market is unusual in many ways, in that the normal correlations of stocks to bonds are not there, or any safe haven assets. It is all dropping together. 

What this shows is a lack of confidence in any particular asset. Everyone is taking their ball and going home. They have no place to put their trust into, what with our Bankruptcy King president on the helm at the absolute worst possible time, Lagarde throwing Italy and the cohesion of the EU under the bus with a single phrase, and an overall lack of trustworthy leadership anywhere in the world. 

So how will this crisis of trust resolve?

If you ask me, you put it where there is no trust necessary. No trust is necessary because possession is easily verifiable, transaction irreversibility is understood, and no one can print willy nilly to their hearts desire, and reach into your pocket by doing so and pulling out purchasing power from your wallet. Throw in a monetary policy that is transparent and hard coded from inception that everyone understands and can trust won't change tomorrow or in 10 years.

The fundamental crisis of the moment is completely and squarely a trust-centric crisis. 

Once people start to stick their heads out of their bunkers, after this crazy hurricane has blown past and begin to take stock of the lessons and next moves, there is only one system designed to specifically counteract this precise doom-and-gloom scenario from ever even being possible to exist.

CryptoCurrency,COVID-19 the cash crunch and the rebound,"First, stocks crashed on the assumption that consumer demand would fall. People are selling because they want cash NOW, and they want to stock up on toiletpaper before the virus hits. 

Ok. 

What do we know? 

1. People recover from the virus. 
2. Old people die from the virus. 
3. The stock market's true crash is only beginning. 
4. The fed will do anything to prop up the stock market, and when they realize their mistake it will be too late. 

So first off, you are probably not going to die from covid if you are a crypto trader, simply for the reason your under 60 probably. Your parents and your friend's parents will not be so lucky however. Alot of them WILL DIE. And we are looking at between 6 million to 12 million american deaths. But, you have to remember... who owns the stocks? Who owns the real estate? What demographic holds bonds? Your parents and your friend's parents. That means that when covid-19 is all over, alot of real control over the economy is going to land in the hands of people in OUR age group. And our age group has a percentage of their assets in crypto. 

Second. The fed will be issuing helicopter money. That is to say that purchasing power of the dollar is about to take a major hit. We will see double digit inflation. The crash is only just beginning. It will play out over at least 2 years. Possibly more. 

Third, if you look at the price of the DJI on a month scale, it looks almost identical to btc on a week scale pre-2017 Its a classic bubble. It is going to pop. When it does pop, it will drag the US dollar into the mud with it. Does that mean bitcoin will be worth a million dollars? Maybe. Will you be able to buy nice things with that million dollars? Maybe. 

I think that this price drop is just volatility, its no reason to get panicked. I put my money where my mouth is, and I calculated out what I would spend in dollar cost averaging into btc over the next 9 months, and bought that amount outright. I managed to get lucky, and caught btc at 4k. Its already back at 5.6k at time of typing this out, so I made out like a bandit, and I am happy with my buy. I am going to spend the rest of the year until december paying down that loan. 

How did I get lucky? I kept a close eye on the CME bitcoin futures, and when the may/june futures dropped below the spot price of btc, I knew that spirits had finally been crushed, and it was time to pull the trigger. Anyways, bitcoin is going to rebound fairly quick. Give it a month, and we will be dancing around 8-9k again.",cryptocurrency

After 30 years, he has two options. Either get his money back with an interest rate of course, or get something like 400 euro per month for as many years as he lives.

investing,"I bought the dip, but it just kept on dippin'","So when things started going down, I gauged my risk tolerance and came up with my investing strategy for the year: 

- Take 1/3 of my cash to open positions when the market dropped -10%. Given that for a while we've had flash drops that only lasted a few days, I wanted to at least gain something if the markets got propped again (which the Fed did try, it just didn't work)

- Take 1/3 to DCA for the rest of the year. This was a safety net no matter how the market moved, and would tide me over until I get a new influx of cash next year

- Take 1/3 and split it so I buy in each - 5% drop, running out of money until -35%. This was more of ""reach"" since a few weeks ago I didn't think it would happen. I figured I would just take this unused money and DCA it next year

Like many I didn't figure we would drop so hard so fast. Looking at futures right now (-2.50%), we may hit -35% tomorrow. Damn

But given that I have a plan, it's keeping my head on my shoulders. Even if the market dips massively, my holdings should average to having bought at a 20% discount or more. Add to that dividends and reinvestments and I feel way less stressed about how long those red numbers will last",finance

stocks,What Do I Do With My Money? - Market Outlook,"So I wanted to share my thoughts on the overall market outlook and what to do with your money when it comes to stocks, 401k, IRAs, and Mortgages. I know most people reading this have probably never experienced anything remotely close to this before in their lifetime. The information I am going to go over below are just my personal opinions and what I would do.

### Market Outlook

I'm going to break this portion up into three sections. The first section I will discuss the earlier issues we experienced with COVID-19 in China. The second section will go over how COVID-19 impacts the market over the next 6-12 months. And the third section I will discuss what I call ""The Perfect Storm"".

**Big Business Supply Chain**

So to start we need to understand how the original impacts of COVID-19 in China have and will impact our market. Over 75% of US companies had their supply chains disrupted due to China having to shut down during the outbreak. Why does this matter? Well think about some of the big companies that had this happen, Amazon, Google, Microsoft, IBM, Intel. A lot of these companies have already come out and said that they are going to miss their expected earnings during the next quarter. I believe this is already somewhat priced in but I believe the recovery time for these business will be much longer than 1 quarter. You can expect most of these companies to suffer from this for the next 6-9 months at least. So now you have to realize that a lot of large corporations are going to miss their quarterly earnings for up to the next year.

**COVID-19 and the United States**

We just briefly went over how these businesses supply chains got thrown out of whack and could take up to a year to recover. Now COVID-19 has crept its way into the US and is already presenting some big time operational issues for these same businesses that are already dealing with supply chain problems. As you may have heard over the past couple days a lot of businesses are trying to find ways to allow employees to work remotely or sending people home, schools are shutting down, sporting leagues are getting suspended and this is just the first few thousand cases that have been identified. How does this impact the market? Well, let's think about tech companies, a lot of these companies have yearly computer, phone, smart device, tablet upgrades. How are they going to meet that demand when they had supply chain delays in China and are now experiencing operations slow downs in the US? Point blank - they aren't. Most of these companies are more than likely to announce significant delays in product launches which is going to trigger uncertainty from shareholders which will result in drop in stock prices. This is going to be a prevalent theme for quite a while. This is going to cause fear in investors and continue to see heavier sell volume than buy volume over the next 6-9 months until these companies stabilize again.

**The Perfect Storm**

Let me breakdown what I am calling the perfect storm and why I think it is going to shake things up further with the market. The first part of this perfect storm is what I covered above which is COVID-19, I already detailed why this is going to impact the market and have a lasting effect over the next 6 months. The second part is the recent Saudi Arabia and Russia oil price wars, the oil and gas sector has taken a huge hit due to this and combined that with COVID-19 and travel bans, you now have a pandemic across the world and a war on oil overseas. The third and final piece of this perfect storm is the upcoming election. The run-up to an election always shakes up the stock market because you have all these shareholders having uncertainty when it comes to the candidates and who is going to be best for businesses and who is projected to win and this causes major ebbs and flows in the market as we get closer to a presidential election. So now lets review, we have uncertainty with COVID-19 and what the current and future impacts will be. We have uncertainty on the oil price war overseas and how that's going to play out, and in about 3-4 months we will have uncertainty within the market around the election. Combining all these factors we will see some continued significant drops over the next 12 month period.

At this point I do believe we will fall into an economic recession based off the above information, we will be in a downtrend for at least the next 6 months and depending on how long it takes the US to recover from COVID-19 we could see the impact for at least 1 year potentially longer.

### Ok, So What Do I Do With My Money?

Let's kick things off by discussing your 401k, so I'm sure some of you that are younger may be freaking out a bit and wondering should I sell out of my 401k funds and just keep the account cash? Should I move the funds into bonds? Let me give you this to think on, so lets say you can't withdraw your 401k for at least another 10 years, in my opinion your best bet is to leave your 401k alone, don't touch it. You may think, how does that make any sense? Well for starters the market always bounces back so I wouldn't worry too much about seeing your account balance go down in the short term, always remember that your 401k is a long term play. The other factor is you can view this as an opportunity, I would recommend to continue to put money towards your 401k as it allows you to essentially average yourself down on the shares that you currently have. This presents a great opportunity for you to see a nice increase in the shares you buy now and for the foreseeable future because those shares will eventually become very profitable once the market comes out of the bear market/recession a few years from now. Think about the prices that people were able to buy their 401k shares at back in 2008 and how much of a come up they have seen since. Have that mindset going into this upcoming time.

The next topic I wanted to touch on is something I have gotten a lot of questions on the past few weeks, which is investors and traders asking me What Should I Buy Into? Well right now, I believe the answer is: Nothing! In my opinion COVID-19 news is going to get worse, more cases, more business and educational challenges, more high profile people getting diagnosed. Remember when China first had the outbreak it grew exponentially the first few weeks before leveling off, the same thing is going to happen in the US. Until we start to see it level off a bit, then market is going to see some violent swings to the downside, I don't believe a good buying opportunity will present itself for at least another 10-14 days maybe longer. Once we get past the brunt of it, I believe some of the best longer term plays to invest in will be the Oil and Gas sector. Two of the leaders in this sector are COP and XOM, these stocks pay a nice dividend, are sector leaders and have been around forever. They both have lost roughly 50% of their per share value and are setup well for you to make a healthy return within the next few years. Look back when these stocks took a dive in 2016 and the recovery they have had since. This presents another great opportunity to buy in and hold for some big returns. Just remember, you more than likely will not catch the very bottom on these stocks, I recommend entering with a starter position and gradually scale yourself in to maximize your potential returns.

The last thing I wanted to touch on is your mortgage. A lot of people are inquiring about refinancing their homes right now. This is not a bad idea if you can at least shave 0.75 points off your interest rate. However, I personally believe rates will continue to drop as we go through these trying times, I believe the opportunity will present itself over the next 6 months to get an even lower rate. I also believe we may see additional federal rate cuts to assist homeowners and help with the potential economic recession we will be entering. I would recommend if you really need to refinance to help out your financial situation right now then go ahead and do it if you will save more than 0.75 points by doing so. However, if you are in a more comfortable position currently you may want to hold out a little longer for the potential of snagging an even lower rate and presenting yourself with a better financial opportunity.

### Final Thoughts

That about wraps up my market outlook and my thoughts on how to best handle your money during these times. I believe if you are on the younger side, don't get discouraged about what's happening, look at it as an opportunity to grow your financial wealth and knowledge. We are in weird time where a lot of uncertainty is entering the market and our daily lives. I recommend checking out some stock charts and information from back in the 1980s or 2008 to see what happened and how the market recovered and think about the opportunity you may presented with to capitalize on this and set yourself up well for the future.

investing,1000 point swing on the overnight futures,"Key points from article that sparked the turn around.

""Ms. Pelosi told reporters that “we’ve resolved most of our differences” and the House would vote on Friday on the measure

The legislation, according to a letter Ms. Pelosi sent to her members, will include enhanced unemployment benefits, free virus testing, aid for food assistance programs and federal funds for Medicaid. The package also ensures 14 days of paid sick leave, as well as tax credits to help small- and medium-size businesses fulfill that mandate.

Progress toward a compromise between Democrats and the Trump administration was a remarkable turnaround after a day of doubts

Mr. Mnuchin, in a frantic attempt to keep talks on track, spoke by phone eight times with Ms. Pelosi, negotiating changes to the House legislation so that it could have a chance of winning the support of Mr. Trump and Senate Republicans""

personalfinance,Is now a good time to refinance student loans?,"I have $80,000 in student loans (10k federal, 70k private).  I graduated this past December and I've been applying for jobs since December (currently unemployed).  My plan is to wait until I get a decent paying job before I refinance my student loans.  My thought process here is that since I have to report my income when I apply to refinance, I will likely get a better interest rate with a job than I would if I applied while unemployed.

With the market being down due to the coronavirus, would it be a good idea to refinance my student loans now, even though I am still unemployed?  Does the current market status affect these interest rates?",finance

personalfinance,Neighbors have irs tax lien and they never refinanced house and are paying double digit interest,"Neighbor didn’t refinance home from 06 and has 100k IRS liens on house

I learned today my long term neighbor has major financial problems and I’m trying to help the family out.

First thing. Credit is terrible under 550. They have 160k left in the mortgage. However, they are paying near 10% interest rates!!

House is worth 320k


They have 110k federal irs liens. And are behind the mortgage by 3 months because the breadwinner is out of work.

They have bought new cars every other year and and ready to give up the cars to get more cash flow.

They will be going through bankruptcy. However, that federal tax lien may not be wiped.

They have NO savings and the house is all they have. 

What should they do? Sell the house and pay off the tax lien? Down size?

They obviously can’t refinance because the credit score is below 550.

It’s a very sad situation.",finance

I don’t know much about credit cards already so I don’t really trust Apple compared to an actual bank. 

I’m not sure where to begin on all of this. I know what I want to do, I have a plan for it as well. Just unsure what card to get and what all the numbers mean basically.",finance

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

personalfinance,Can I refinance my current home and buy a new home simultaneously?,"We want to refinance our 4.99% 30-year loan on our current home, which we have about $350,000 worth of equity in (we owe about $280k on the loan.)

We’ve been casually looking at new home for the last year, and finally found one that works perfectly for us this past weekend, which we’d need a $1.1m jumbo loan after down payment.

What we were thinking of doing is refinancing the current home to get the lower interest rate, and also pull equity out of it (or get a HELOC? Not sure which is the better move?) - and then applying for a loan to buy the new home, using some of the HELOC/equity to use as a portion of the down payment to hit 20%.

If this a typical thing? What’s the right way to do this if so? Or is this a red flag move that shouldn’t be done because we are trying to get 2 home loans so close together?

btc,The virus vs..,"I am a lurker, but recent events made me want to write this post. This because I have the idea that a lot of us do not have any idea what is going on. I just see too much “look, the store of value myth just got popped” and too few “wow, what is going on is unprecedented. What can we do?”.

We experienced a boom after 2008. This boom was fueled by cheap credit. This is also the case for anything crypto related. Because of this cheap credit, people and institutions had access to extra liquidity which they invested. One would expect that after 2008 the earning/debt ratio of people and institutions would improve. But that did not happen and as a result our financial system is as brittle as it was in 2008. Just about everything is over leveraged.

The COVID-19 virus is acting like a catalyst and is eating away in our financial and economic system. It is necessary to reduce the number of peak infections and to do so, we will see more and more lockdowns. What happend yesterday is just a portent of what is about to hit us. 

We will see another credit crisis and probably this one will hit our financial system harder than it did in 2008. The writing is all over the walls. Major corporations are maxing out their credit lines. Meaning that they do not trust the banks. Yesterday, the fed fired a trillion dollar bazooka just before the 30Y treasury auction. Why? A failing auction might indicate that the market thinks the US will not be able to handle its debt. These are movements that indicate we are heading for a systematic financial crisis. And one that will be heavier than the one in 2008. 

So, instead of focussing on the popping of the store of value bubble, we should be focussing on the what if scenario. What if the system fails? How can we as a community provide aid and solutions? Feeding goats is one thing, helping people is another… ;)",cryptocurrency

economy,"Someone asked a question in another subreddit about how the Fed works, and got a lot of bad answers before the thread was locked, and I didn't see any good answers. So I'm going to do my best to explain it here in case anyone comes looking.","Banks need to have cash on hand for when people make withdrawals.  When a bank needs cash because its reserves are low, it borrows from other banks, or from the Fed.

When a bank borrows money, like anyone else, it must pay an interest rate.  The Fed decides what the base rate will be.  A borrower bank could potentially go to another bank, which will likely charge a slightly higher interest rate, or it could just borrow from the Fed and pay a lower rate.  In reality, the two rates tend to be so close as to make the difference negligible.

This interest rate charged by the Fed (the Fed Funds Rate) becomes the base rate, and all other interest rates tend to be tied to it, though they are generally higher.  When the Fed Funds Rate goes down, all interest rates go down because in lending to other banks, a bank must be competitive, and being able to borrow money at a lower rate enables the banks to lend it out at a lower rate. When the Fed Funds Rate goes up, all interest rates go up because the banks don't have to compete with the lower rate, and it is more expensive for them to borrow money, so they must lend at a higher rate to be profitable.

When interest rates go down, cash is 'cheaper,' and more readily available; this is the how the Fed 'injects' money into the economy.  It is cheaper to borrow money, so more people borrow.  More people get home mortgages and finance new cars, etc.  The money is spent, and this is how the economy is stimulated.

The Fed puts money into the economy by lending it to banks at a lower rate, and the money quickly filters out to the rest of the economy.",finance

personalfinance,Can unsecured creditors take my assets? (CA),"Hey all,

Throwaway for obvious reasons. I'm desperately looking for pragmatic, not moral advice here. I'm under some crushing debts right now. Mainly credit cards but I also owe taxes for 2018 and have 2 unsecured loans.

I'm a freelancer and while I make really, really good money overall, it's either feast or famine which prevents me from making big payments and paying off my debts. I don't want to pay out 20k towards a card if I don't know when my next check is coming in.

Anyway, due to some payroll screw ups on my last gig there was a delay in setting me up as a vendor. So for the first time ever, I haven't yet made my credit card payments this month because if I do so, I won't have enough money to pay rent next month.

And honestly I'm tired of this. I've made minimum payments month over month and my cards still are almost maxed out, even though I haven't used them in over a year. Between my rent and all my loan payments, I need to take home about 9k a month to break even. I know I did this to myself over years of bad money management, but this is hell. And overall, defaulting on debts I owe to big financial institutions isn't something that's going to keep me up at night.

I have no real assets to speak of. I have 2 older cars that I own outright and a small gun collection I've inherited/built up over the past decade. Selling all of that wouldn't pay off my debts. Not even half. That combined is probably all worth 20-25k max.

So my question to you guys is if I just stop paying, what's the worst that can happen? I don't need my credit anymore. I'm not planning on buying a house or financing anything and this past year I've been trying to get back into a cash-on-hand lifestyle, now moreso with all this coronavirus panic.

EDIT: I want to add that one of the main reasons I want to not worry about any of my other credits/debts is because that would free up money to pay my taxes. I know I can't get out of those and I'd honestly have lending club and Amex after me than the feds.",finance

AAPL - Slow growth cyclical business that goes on sale during off product cycle years. Huge net cash hoard has historically made this stock cheaper than it screens, but still trading at higher multiples than its growth can justify.

DIS - Slow growth business with major headwinds not fully priced in. ESPN —not counting ESPN2, etc— demanded $8 a month in revenue from a peak base of \~100m cable subs. ESPN+ cannot hope to compensate. Domestic parks see double-barreled growth every year, international are more mixed. Cinema is likely a golden era and a source of decline rather than growth. Shit ton of debt due to ill-advised FOX acquisition makes this company more expensive than it screens. 

BRK - A terminally slow growth company that owns Burlington Northern Santa Fe railroad, insurance, ie General RE &amp; GIECO, energy, a portfolio of consumer brands, ie Dairy Queen, Fruit of a Loom, Duracell, and a whole lotta misc, ie Precision Castparts, Clayton Homes and about 80 more. Major equity holdings, some $176B worth as of 3/13, include major positions in AAPL, BAC, WFC (declining stake), KO, and AXP. (Equity holdings are down comparably to the SP500 since their 2/14 filing.) Huge cash position of some $120B is likely overstated due to the company’s insurance liabilities. Also due to an accounting law change, unrealized capital gains now affects net income which should be adjusted for when figuring out normalized earnings. 

WFC - Too big to fail, but damnit if that doesn’t keep them from trying. News broke in 2016 that sales personal had been incentivized to reach unrealistic goals, and chose to create millions of fraudulent accounts. Upon receiving the news, management did their best to cover it up even as new cases were being brought to light. The company has been hit by billions in fines and shareholder lawsuits. The former CEO stepped down and the search for the new one took months longer than necessary. The new CEO raises commitment concerns as he refuses to move from New York to San Francisco. Deposit growth trails competitors some \~2% vs \~9%.Assets are capped at $1.9 trillion due to the Fed. It’s possible that the Federal regulators have no incentive to ever leave WFC. The world likely does not need WFC and the competitors will likely continue to eat up market share. 0.8 P/B appears attractive, but better run banks are also trading at cheap multiples.

New Positions

Note: These are tiny positions, each representing .5% - 1% of my total portfolio. I bought these stakes with the understanding that I did not fully understand each business yet.

AMZN, GOOGL, &amp; MSFT - Cloud computing looks like an infinite fish tank to me. All businesses will require more, not less computing going forward. Physical goods over physical channels continues to lose market share to digital channels. Digital goods over digital channels has uncapped potential (think streaming video, music, video games). All of that will need more computing. And given the cyclical nature of demand, it makes sense to have flexible, not fixed, supply. AMZN, GOOGL, and MSFT are currently the only notable players in this space (IBM’s offerings are reportedly laughable). Even if I’m wrong about cloud computing, and it’s merely a commoditized business that will attract outside competition and/or price wars, then those three companies still have wonderful core businesses.

AMZN - The most speculative holding. It’s possible that it’s priced to perfect and that retail will continue to integrate online shopping. Cost leadership is always a fleeting competitive advantage. However, they still have a network that’s impossible to replicate. Their Amazon Prime subscription model is incredibly sticky. I also believe there is untapped pricing potential since goods delivered to your doorstep are clearly more valuable than goods on a store shelf, but AMZN is forced to offer low prices to build up consumer habit. I’m speculating that eventually, once consumers are used to doorstep deliveries, they will gladly pay a premium over physical retail prices. If ten years from now, AMZN still had such tiny margins, then the investment will have likely been a failure.

GOOGL - Between GOOGL &amp; FB, the two basically own online advertising, which is to say advertising since conventional TV ads, newspapers, magazines, etc are all trending down. GOOGL’s propensity to burn money on blue sky projects is why I sold the company years ago —I apparently also had a revulsion towards money myself— but the core business is simply too good to ignore any longer. Also the company has a $115B net cash position that makes it trade at a lower multiple than it screens at.

MSFT - I know the least about this company. But I do know that my irrational hatred for this company has caused me to miss out on one of the greatest value plays of our time. Their productivity suite alone probably made it worth the price, with the cloud going for free. Now I believe I’m getting a wonderful business at a decent price, but more research is needed.

TTWO - Take Two Interactive makes Grand Theft Auto. With their latest iteration, GTAV (2013), they figured out how to smooth the product cycle with online gameplay &amp; purchases. GTAIII sold 15 million copies, GTAIV sold 25, and GTAV sold 110. GTAVI is coming out soon and I think the series sandbox style, online gameplay is perfect for the modern market.  

FB - The company we all love to hate refuses to go away. Fears of declining usage are apparently overgrown. FB is an advertising company with an immensely powerful network. A significant net cash position makes this company trade at a lower multiple than it’s growth would suggest.",finance

personalfinance,Prime rate impact on treasury backed money market fund?,"Sorry in advance for the dumb question.

I have a significant amount of money in a couple treasury backed money market funds. The money is parked there because I've been waiting for a multifamily deal which should be closing within a month.

These are through two different financial institutions. On one institution's website they let me see performance over the past few days and it indicates value on secondary markets is going down. It doesn't let me see a longer term view but treasuries generally seem to have been going up since the rate cut. The other institution doesn't let me see anything other than the amount it's paid out and what's been reinvested.

Do fed rate cuts have an impact on the value of these funds? Or is it not impacted because it's in a money market mutual fund instead of the bonds themselves?",finance

personalfinance,Would using a personal loan instead of an auto loan for a car purchase prevent the lender from applying force placed insurance?,"Long story short, I am looking to buy a vehicle that won't be driven for the first 4 months of ownership. For that reason, I don't plan on paying for insurance until I am actually driving it in order to save money on something that I literally wouldn't be using yet. 

However, I am aware of lenders forcing auto insurance that is usually wildly more expensive than insurance that the buyer themselves could be approved for if the buyer doesn't present their own policy. I want to know if I should just bite the bullet by taking out an auto loan and paying for my own policy for the 4 months the vehicle is unused, or if I could just take out a personal loan in order to prevent the force placed insurance that my lender will apply onto the car so that I can instead start paying for the insurance when I actually start driving it? Is that how it works?

(And yes, due to a combination of the loan amount + term,  the fact that the interest rates for both types of loans being in similar ranges means that accrued interest by the end of the term varies minimally AKA not a big deal to me that I would pay an extra $100 over 3 years if I had to use a personal loan because it'd save me more on insurance anyways if it stopped force placed insurance by the lender)

My wife and I have been looking at houses over the past few months and at the beginning of this month we were preparing to pull the trigger with the tempting interest rates (our original rate was 2.85% and now it is at 3.85%. 

From what our lender said, the rates have risen again due to the surge in home loan applications and the increase is rate is to sort of balance the number of applications they're getting, but said they should come back down in a couple weeks. 

Also, with the Corona stuff going on, not really to informed on what's going on in the market right now, if anything. 

So in short, I'm just curious if we should we hold off until further notice, wait until the rates drop again, or move now (because we still have a fairly low rate) before something else changes.

Most of these people wouldn’t even know what coronavirus is or if they are showing any symptoms. People claiming that the virus cannot survive a hot climate should know that the virus becomes ineffective in transmission but that is not a problem here since we have such population density. Look at Iran, it is literally in the middle of a fucking desert and the virus is still taking a toll. Most of the US companies outsource their work to India since labour is cheap here, imagine the losses the US stock market will take let alone the Indian markets.

personalfinance,My tax return was bigger than it should have been and I don't know why!,"My husband and I filed our joint tax return on TurboTax. We were anticipating a ~1.7k refund from federal, $173 refund from our current state, and $55 from the state we moved from last summer. We haven't received our federal refund yet and we received the paper check for our current state's refund today. My concern is that a few days ago we got a $905 refund deposited into our account from the revenue department of the previous state we lived in.

Did somebody make a mistake and give us too much money? Will this come back to bite us in the ass at some point?


Edited to add: I called the revenue department for that state and it turns out the extra $850 was legit.

1. Given the COVID-19 outbreak, I wonder if it would be wise for me to either use the extra payments to beef up my emergency fund (currently at about 4 months of expenses, my income is unlikely to be affected by the outbreak) or invest in discounted stocks.
2. I am planning to take a 2-month sabbatical from work in September of 2020 and need to save about $6k for travel and expenses (rent back home, etc.) while I'm on unpaid leave. I could probably save that much by living frugally and making the minimum payments on my loans for the next 2 months.

I know 3.6% is cheap money, and even under normal circumstances I could get a better return by investing instead of making extra payments. I just have been looking forward to paying them off for so long that it's difficult for me to objectively consider that there might be better options.

personalfinance,Need help with a mysterious PHEAA student loan,"After not receiving my tax refund for 4+ weeks, I turned to the IRS ""find my refund tool"". This told me that my refund had been claimed by the Treasury Offset Program and applied to an outstanding debt of mine. It also stated that I should have received a letter from the Bureau of Fiscal Services but I did not. The only debt that I know of is my student loan with Sallie Mae and this loan is not defaulted. I make monthly payments on it. I called Sallie Mae to ask if they had seized my tax refund and they stated that they are not a federal organization and cannot seize funds. I was then redirected to the Department of Education who then redirected me to Action Financial Services, a debt collection agency. After providing them with my social security number, the representative informed me of a loan with PHEAA (Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Angency) with a current balance of $27,000 between the two colleges I had attended (College of St. Rose and University of New Haven). This loan is in default, probably because I didn't even know it existed and have never made a payment on it since it was initiated in 2013. I have never heard of PHEAA, nor has my mother who played a major roll in my application of my Sallie Mae student loan. In the past 7 years I have never gotten a letter, phone call or email from PHEAA. I dont want this PHEAA loan to plunge me further into debt or continue to stay in collections, taking future tax returns or anything else.

MachineLearning,[Discussion] Multi Arm Bandit fed with batched data,"Hello,

I have been reading about MAB to apply it to my use case which is digital advertising.
I have 5 adverts that I'm showing to people and I'm collecting the events of each adverts (I collect the number of clicks and impression for each ads in real time)
 
I wanted to use something like MAB to smartly start showing more and more the advert that performs the best the based on the number of clicks and impression (CTR)

So it looks like MAB can be a perfect fit for this, however after reading a whole bunch of paper on MAB and its algorithm they all have in common that the the algo process every single impression one by one.

Since I'm collecting a lottt of data I'm aggregating it in real time and spitting the number of clicks and impression for each advert every 5 minutes (Sliding window style) I don't know if particular click has yielded a click or not.

Now... let's take for example the UCB-1 algorithm. In all the paper I have read the algo has in input a tab with all the Arms and a '1' or a '0' as reward.
In my case I do not have the break down of if a particular 'impression' resulted in a click or not. 
All what I have is the total number clicks and impression over a certain period of time.

So my question is, is it possible to use aggregated (batched?) data with algorithm such as UCB-1, Thompson Sampling etc.. to solve my problem? 
Would it be correct to 'loop' through the total number of impression and 'guess' the reward by for example taking a binomial value using the CTR of an ad? 

At the moment my algo looks roughly like this:


    totalImpression = the sum of all the ads impression combined
    for impression in range(0, totalImpression):
       ad = 0
       max_upper_bound = 0
       for i in range(0, ads):
           if (numbers_of_selections[i] &gt; 0):
               avg_ctr = sums_of_reward[i] / numbers_of_selections[i]
               delta_i = math.sqrt(2 * math.log(impression+1) / numbers_of_selections[i])
               upper_bound = avg_ctr + delta_i
           else:
               upper_bound = 1e400
           if upper_bound &gt; max_upper_bound:
               max_upper_bound = upper_bound
               ad = i
       ads_selected.append(ad)
       numbers_of_selections[ad] += 1
       trueCTROfTheSelectedAd = the true CTR calculted using the input observed data for the selected ad
       reward = int(np.random.binomial(1, trueCTROfTheSelectedAd, size=1))`
       sums_of_reward[ad] += reward
       total_reward += reward

the ad that got the highest reward is the one that will be shown to the people

datascience,Data science in Recessionary periods,"Some professions in some sectors do OK during recessionary periods. 

- For example if you're an engineer working for a public utility company delivering water and power (because people always need water and electricity). 

- People in healthcare industries also do OK (people always get sick). 

- If you work for a bank, as long as you're front office (revenue generating) and not middle office or back office (cost centers), your jobs will be save.

**What about data scientists?**

We know the recession is coming and it will be pretty bad. Central banks have run out of ammo since interest rates are so low. The only cheap tricks they have is doing QE's so we don't know how long this recession will last. Learning from Japan, it's highly possible we will go bad for a really long time. 

Since data science as a profession is a new thing and since most of the time data scientists is non-revenue generating, what do you guys think will happen in this upcoming recession/depression?

What are your takes on the following professions in different industries:

- data scientists (R&amp;D)

- data engineers

- data analysts (aka: data scientists type A, or FAANG type data scientists)

- BI

- machine learning engineers

I can start: 

If you're any of the above within healthcare, you will surely be OK (data scientists have worked in healthcare sectors for a long time, and they're called statisticians). If you're in retail, perhaps you better have enough emergency funds.

**Edit:** I'd like to take the discussion a step further. An organization will keep you around as long as your value is greater than your costs. 

So my next question is:**What would you need in terms of skills, knowledge, ability, etc so that your value is higher than your costs (so that your organization will keep you)?**",technology

personalfinance,I think I overpaid on my first paycheck.,"Hi everyone,

I recently got my first paycheck for a new job I started a few weeks ago. I currently get paid $30.9/hr, so about \~$64k not taxed. I plan on being in the Air Force reserve some time this year, so I checked the Step 2.C box for ""(c) If there are only two jobs total, you may check this box. Do the same on Form W-4 for the other job. This option is accurate for jobs with similar pay; otherwise, more tax than necessary may be withheld"" I am single.

&amp;#x200B;

I completely overlooked the last part because they are not a similar paying job at all. I look at getting &lt;$5k for the reserve and I'm looking at contributing 100% of it to my TSP (I am prior service). I've done Roth TSP contributions my whole time active duty, so I plan on contributing Roth TSP contributions for this one too.

&amp;#x200B;

I used the withholding calculator on the IRS site [https://apps.irs.gov/app/tax-withholding-estimator/about-you](https://apps.irs.gov/app/tax-withholding-estimator/about-you), as well as this site [https://smartasset.com/taxes/georgia-paycheck-calculator#OytflAh8MA](https://smartasset.com/taxes/georgia-paycheck-calculator#OytflAh8MA) since I am paying GA state tax.

&amp;#x200B;

According to that calculator, on an income of $30.9/hr for a 80 hour work period = $2472 gross pay. I should be paying $298 on federal taxes, $153 on social security, $36 on medicare, $122 on state taxes. So after $609 taxes, I'd receive $1863.

&amp;#x200B;

The issue here: my most current paycheck states: the gross pay of $2472. $618.99 on federal taxes, $185.5 on social security, $43.38 on medicare, $149.26 on state tax (says GA J 1 INCM HMS) and $160.89 on state tax (says GA J 2 INCOMES). So after 1158.02 taxes, I received $1313.98.

&amp;#x200B;

So I am sure the issue was that checked box, so I resubmitted my W-4 without the checked box, but with a $100 withholding in Step 4.C, because according to the IRS withholding calculator, $100 (says I will get about a $4200 refund next year. Otherwise, if I want to break even I'd need to do  **$2,109**  for credits and other reductions?)

&amp;#x200B;

For my state w-4 (called G-4), I put 1 for my allowances.

&amp;#x200B;

Was resubmitting my W-4 the fix to this issue or not?

personalfinance,Airline Employee Fearing Impending Furlough. Need Advice to Prepare,"The airline industry is being absolutely DEVASTATED on a level that's incomprehensible by this pandemic and ensuing panic (justified or not, doesn't matter). The darkest days are yet to come and not even over a decade (over 13 years) of seniority may save my job. Internally it is being said by upper management that this will be worse than post 9/11 for the airlines.

They are trying to make it through the storm through at least April, offering a whole host of options to make it through the storm but with over a 70+% drop in future bookings, deep deep route cuts and layoffs are eventually in order. I fear that I may not make it though the end of the summer.

Thousands of people will possibly lose their jobs over the next 12 months. We're all on edge and being in the office is unnerving to say the least. This is the only job and industry I have known. (15 years since college) I have no idea what I am going to do without it.

With that said, I need some advice on how to approach this. I know it will be at least 3-5 months before a chance of layoffs based on just where I am at in seniority.

I have 3 solid months of cushion built up for all expenses, maybe 5-6 if I stretch it thin. Currently cutting all non-essential services immediately (Entertainment, monthly expenses, going out etc...)

Trying to still save every dime I have, lowered my 401K contribution (already have 13K in it) to about 5% pretax, was putting in 20% of my income + my 2019 profit sharing into it that got it to 13K for the year.  Any OT or extra shifts offered I will take if offered obviously, though unlikely given the current situation.

About $2500 in CC debt (holidays and vacation in February was placed on it.) I was planning on paying it off this month, but now thinking about just paying the minimum payment on it? Smart to stretch out the liability or no?

$450 a month vehicle expense. Thinking about selling it just to get out from under the loan. Approx 28K left on it. Vehicle currently isnt needed since I live in a city with transportation, however it is desirable.

$2000 a month in rent. Can prob sublease as its desirable location and price, then go for cheaper. Moving home to parents or family is unrealistic due to them being on the other side of the country. If laid off, will move home if needed and job recalls prospect looks bleak.

$8500 left on student loan. Paying approx $200 month

Monthly gross income is approx 9500 PRETAX and deductions. About 2000 take home per check. (401K, all health, supplemental insurance, Federal/State income tax, union dues...etc)

*EDIT: To clarify the above:*

*First check of each month is approx 2500 take home (overrides are included in this check)*

*Second check is about 2000 take home.*

*So, in total per month my take home is about $4500 TOTAL after deductions. (about 1500 per check, or 3000 total a month was going to 401K)*

I guess what I am asking is if there are any options to pursue about deferring payments on loans due to lay off, what other options to look at that I am missing. Unemployment obviously, but anything else to supplement it? Any offers? Any ideas? Just anything you guys have to offer I will take to heart. Thanks.

Banking,What the Fed’s $1.5 Trillion cash injection means,"Are you angry over the $1.5 Trillion cash injection by the Fed? You shouldn’t be! Let me explain:

TL;DR: The Fed simply swapped out cash for securities. No taxpayer funds used, it wasn’t a bailout. It allows you and I to go to our banks and still withdraw money. 

The Fed announced $1.5 Trillion in government bond purchases and term REPO operations. What does this mean? It means they are offering to buy US government bonds from banks and broker/dealers so that these banks have enough liquid cash to continue to operate. That is, make loans to earn interest to pay you and operate the bank. It means they have cash to give you when you make an ATM withdrawal. In return for this cash, the banks give the Fed government bonds and notes - basically the government is buying back their own bonds and notes they have issued. Not exactly verbatim because the Fed and the US Treasury are separate...but it’s like your mom giving your dad money for something, it’s all the same household, right? In the end, NOTHING WAS GIVEN AWAY. This was not a bailout, simply swapping cash for non-cash assets. Cash is fungible, securities are not. 

The term REPO operations are essentially short terms loans to these banks in exchange for, you guessed it, government bonds. This is SECURITIZED, it’s not free money. Banks do REPO operations every day to fund the operation of their bank. In situations like this when it’s hard to find someone to lend the cash, the Fed steps in to be that lender so that our baking system can continue to operate normally. 

All of this activity is simply putting liquid cash in the market and taking less liquid, non-cash assets out in order for our baking system to continue to function. In order for you and I to be able to go to a bank and get money, take out a loan, etc. 

No taxpayer funds are used, unlike a bailout that Congress has done. There is a net 0 change in wealth (you could argue some slight macro changes in the securities, for sure) but for all intents and purposes, 0 net change in wealth. 

This is GOOD FOR EVERYONE. It keeps the banking system operating and stable.",finance

Later on, in January, I put $3500 into the account from my bank account (note, nothing pre-tax, from me or my employer) to reduce the taxable income on my tax return this year. 

Then I just checked over some stuff before submitting the tax return and noticed on all of my HSA documents, my plan card, HSA start date, etc, that the starting date said 1/1/20. Basically realized that I don't actually have the right to claim this insurance type this year and deduct that $3500.

Now this is what I am unsure on. I have already submit a request to remove the $3500 excess from my account to my healthcare provider/bank. I also did zero investing of that cash, so there is not income off of it. Since this was all contributed from my after-tax cash, am I correct in thinking that I simply need to undo the HSA portion of my tax return (it then takes a big chunk out of my federal return amount) and I should still be good to file?

personalfinance,Tax amendment question,"Hey all,

Thanks in advance for any insight on this matter.  This may be a novice question, but not too well versed in this subject yet.

So, in brief, I've filed my taxes for 2019 and received both Federal and State tax returns.  Since filing, I  realized that under total adjustments, I accidentally under-reported the amount of Student Loan Interest I paid.  This was likely due to the fact that my student loan servicer was changed mid year and I only received the tax form from one of them.

What I reported for Student Loan Interest paid: $316.17

What I believe I should have reported: ($5,813.17+$316.79 = $6,129.96).

Nelnet Student Interest paid: $5,813.17

FedLoan Student Interest paid: $316.79

I imagine I would need to file an amendment, would it make a significant impact on my return?

&amp;#x200B;

Also, after filing my return, I decided to open a Roth IRA with Vangaurd (last week).  I have contributed $6,000 for the 2019 year and that money is still just sitting in the money market fund.  The money hasn't been allocated to any mutual funds or anything yet.  I imagine I should also include this on my amendment as it would likely alter my tax return for the year?

I filed using FreeTaxUSA.  On the website, when I go to the Ammend option, I see a ""warning"" that states:

""**Are you** **REALLY** **sure you want to amend your tax return?**

Once you click *Yes* below, your account changes to an amended return account and it **CAN'T** be changed back.""

Does this flag the IRS that they should expect an amendment, or is this something that just flags FreeTaxUSA that I intend to file an amendment?

personalfinance,Tax implications of loaning a friend $10k,"A very close friend of mine is currently drowning in high interest student loan and medical debt. I'm lucky enough to be in a very financially stable situation currently, and I'd like to lend him around $10k at 0% interest to help him get back on his feet and give him some breathing room.

&amp;#x200B;

I've done a little research and it sounds like the federal government requires a minimum interest rate on any personal loan, which varies depending on the length of said loan. This is frustrating because it's my money but it feels like I'm being told what I can and can't do with it. Also, while it lessens my friend's financial strain (though not as much as I would like), it means that I have to deal with a potential tax headache of figuring out how much he owes me in interest, and reporting it as income on my taxes.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm wondering if this is a legal and viable way to get around the federally mandated minimum interest rate:

I ""gift"" my friend $10k, and then over multiple years he gives me regular cash ""gifts"" that eventually add up to the amount I originally gave him. 

&amp;#x200B;

Since all money changing hands would be considered gifts it shouldn't count as income on either of our parts, so neither of us would have to change anything about they way that we file taxes. Also I don't think that $10k is high enough to trigger the gift tax. Am I correct in these assumptions and is this a legal method of giving someone a personal loan? Is it completely above board, or is it something that is a legal gray area and I would have to try to keep the IRS from looking too closely? I understand that since the money wouldn't be considered a loan, I would have no legal recourse if something happened and my friend was unable to pay back the full sum.

Trump also wasted no time in referring to the disease as a “foreign virus” and emphasized the origin of the outbreak in China as an obvious attempt to whip up ever more anti-Chinese sentiment and stir up more support for increasing hostilities and a future war with China. This sort of rhetoric also feeds into existing racist attacks against East Asian people. Already, we have seen an increase in anti-Chinese racism in particular, especially in the U.S. and European countries. In London, a man from Singapore [was brutally beaten](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-london-51771355) on February 24. More recently in NYC, [a viral video showed a man spraying Febreze on an Asian passenger on the subway](https://abc7ny.com/coronavirus-fear-video-shows-suspected-hate-crime-on-subway/5989856/).

Trump then announced a 30-day travel restriction on people coming in from the European Union. But Great Britain is exempted from the ban, making it possible for the UK to transmit the virus to the US. There is also a dangerous lack of clarity on whether international shipping and imports are to be affected; though Trump did claim that this restriction would apply to trade, he later tweeted that [“the restriction stops people not goods”.](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1237924658185469954) Trump also exempted “Americans who have undergone appropriate screenings” – though it is clear that these screenings have been insufficient, with [TSA agents themselves infected with and spreading the Coronavirus ](https://www.tsa.gov/news/2020/03/11/tsa-statement-covid-19-sjc). These restrictions leave many holes for further introduction of COVID19 into the U.S., and come at a time of already-rampant community spread of the disease in multiple urban centers across the country.

Furthermore, though the Trump government has pledged $8.3 Billion to combat the virus, a look at Italy’s current spending of [$28.3 Billion](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/11/coronavirus-live-updates.html) or even South Korea’s spending of [$13 Billion](https://www.wsj.com/articles/south-korea-spends-billions-to-blunt-coronaviruss-economic-impact-11582872869) shows how inadequate this level of funding is for a country as big as the U.S. Trump mentions “emergency action, which is unprecedented, to provide financial relief for workers sick with or otherwise caring for others or quarantined with the virus” but goes into little more detail on how he aims to provide such help. Indicators point in the opposite direction, especially as [Senate Republicans moved to block legislation that would have provided sick leave for all Americans ](https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/487113-gop-chairman-blocks-quick-passage-of-paid-sick-leave-bill)the same day as Trump’s address. In contrast, Trump went into far more detail on how he intends to provide loans to banks and capitalists, with promises to bail them out to offset capital lost in response to market fallout caused by the virus.

personalfinance,Bad Idea to go back to school wtih CC and Student Debt? And do I continue to NOT contribute to a 401(k) until debts are eliminated?,"Edit: Thanks everyone for the feedback. I really don't need to be enrolled in a CS program to practice programming. Going to hold off and try to make my own projects in my free time to see if it holds my interest. 

&amp;#x200B;

Is it a bad idea to go back to school for a second degree while in a considerable amount of debt?

This is my current situation:

**Federal Student Loans – $45,510.87 (3-6.5%; $180 min; $25 towards principal per payment)**

**Private Student Loans - $8,435.57 at 8.845% ($100 min.)**

**Card #1 - $4205.00 ($83 min.)**

· $129.26 at 20.49%

· $4075.74 at 3.99%

**Card #2 - $10,103.56 ($200 min.)**

· 2,699.19 at 22.49%

· 3,443.88 at 7.99%

· 3,960.49 at 6.99%

**Total: $68,255.00**

&amp;#x200B;

Fortunately, I will be able to work full time while attending school part time.

**Gross Income: $35,000\~**

**Take Home: $2150\~ per month**

**Monthly Expenses - $1492**

· Rent: $850 (Includes utilities and internet)

· Groceries: $460

· Phone: $20

· Car Insurance: $42

· Gas: $20

· Spending: $100

&amp;#x200B;

I'm left with $95 after all my expenses and minimum payments towards my debts. I also have $650 in an emergency fund. Also I'm set to receive pay raises of 2-8% every 6 months depending on my performance.

I'd like to make a career change and focus more on hard-skills. I'd like to earn a degree in computer science (Focus on web and gam development), and it will cost about $12,000 for my degree. My current company offers tuition reimbursement up to $3000 per year. I'd be set to complete my degree in Spring 2022. Being reimbursed for 2020 and 2021, it looks as though I'd take $6000 more out in student loans.

&amp;#x200B;

Is this a really bad idea? Taking on even more debt? Am I better off practicing programming and building things on my own? I don't believe I need to go to school to get good at programming, then again, some employers need to see a CS degree just to cull the herd of applicants.

And on a quick side note:  My company will match 50% of 401(k) contributions, up to 6%. I contribute nothing because I feel my interest rates outpace my contribution. Am I doing this right?",finance

personalfinance,Should I apply for a credit card or refinance my car first?,"So full details:

I am about to turn 24. I have roughly a 640 credit score. My utilization was sky high (90%) because of recent events. I paid it down from the 101% it was at to get it to the 640 (highest its been so far while growing) from a 600.

I recently paid it down to roughly 30% or so, and am waiting for it to actually hit my credit. Considering everything on my credit history looks nice except the horrible utilization, I assume it will jump considerably.

I will not be using my credit cards for almost anything in the coming year or so since I have settled in to a nicer place financially and will have the extra income to live with. 

Seconds bit:

I bought a car last year when I hit a 620 because I was in a bad place in life and needed one. The interest rate was obviously sky high. It's a very reliable car, but the interest was around 16%. I will pay almost double if I finance the entire duration.

My 2 goals are to refinance my car for a lower rate, and also get an additional credit card with a lower interest rate to transfer my remaining balances to until paid off, and consequently lower my utilization altogether.

I know certain companies won't approve you after you've had over a certain amount of inquiries in a certain time period. I was wondering if I should look into refinancing or applying for a better card first?

If you need any additional info, please comment, I'll reply as soon as I can. Thanks in advance.

TLDR;

My credit is crap, but about to jump, my interests rates are crap. Should I refinance my car or apply for a better card to lower utilization and interest rates?",finance

CryptoCurrency,"To all Bitcoiners out there, ignore the noise","The no-coiners and alt-coiners come out in force on the day of a world wide economic collapse that is still on-going and will prove to be a major event for the history books. 

They are desperate for events they can point at to make them feel smart and have ‘proof’ they were right all along. Most of the days they feel terrible since these events are scarcer than Bitcoin itself. They have the peak of the bubble of 2017 and now the huge dip of 2020, the start of the big economic collapse.

Ignore the noise. They either have an altcoin they need to pump 500% to recover their losses or they need that itchy feeling to go away telling them Bitcoin might come back stronger than ever to prove them wrong.

Bitcoin is still on track to be the best performing bearer asset the world has ever seen. It has a predictable monetary policy with a provable scarcity. Right now 1800 BTC is created daily through the block rewards. In 4 years time, after the next two halvings, this has become 450 BTC daily. By then it has a higher stock to flow than gold and it is the world most scarce bearer asset. And on top of that it is easily divisible and transferred digitally.

Yes, Bitcoin took a massive dump (altcoins even worse!) but even gold went down over 4%. You would think that the only real SoV would skyrocket in times like these, but the alt-and nocoiners of Reddit have decided that -4% is not a problem for a SoV, but Bitcoin needs to only rise in value every day. 

This is nonsense. Ofcourse crypto took a much bigger dump, but that is because it is still a very risk asset and those tend to be sold off first in times of crisis.

Let’s look at the yearly lows of Bifcoin:


2012: $4 

2013: $65 

2014: $200 

2015: $185 

2016: $365 

2017: $780 

2018: $3,200

2019: $3,360

2020: around $3,900 so far.

Bitcoin is only 11 years old. Gold has been used for thousands of years, is widely accepted as a SoV and even gold lost 4% in value. Just wait how central banks will need to print trillions of dollars and how everyones fiat will be debased significantly. Gold as it’s age as a positive property, but Bitcoins potential is much bigger.

Bitcoin only needs to keep grinding block after block. You only need to stay calm and ignore the noise.",cryptocurrency

investing,The risk of oil shocks has returned,"One of the main theories as to why both inflation and growth have been very positive is the large contribution of US shale to creating a price ceiling on oil. As the OPEC ""price war"" goes on, an increasing number of US drillers will reduce operations or close entirely. This will only allow OPEC or ""black swans"" to increase the price of oil higher due to the lag time between oil prices being high enough to justify US drilling and that crude reaching the market.

The current drop in crude has provided an excellent opportunity to purchase insurance against such events. You can purchase an $18 Jan 2022 call on USO for \~$0.12, which will give you the effective ability too buy crude at \~$85/barrel for the next two years.

personalfinance,First Time as an Independent Contractor,"Hi everyone!

After months of searching I finally landed a new job with a great company, but since I don't reside in the state where they primarily do business I've been hired as an independent contractor. This is my first time ever being hired as an independent contractor and so while I've been doing my research, I have a lot of questions as well. Ideally I would like to avoid using an accountant (mostly because I enjoy finance and numbers and want to learn), so your advice is much appreciated!

I understand that as an independent contractor I'm responsible for paying estimated quarterly state and federal taxes. I'm under the understanding that 25-30% is a good rule of thumb for putting money aside for taxes, but what I don't know is how much should go towards federal and how much towards state taxes, that is if state tax applies to me - I'll get to that in a minute.

Additionally, I don't have a 401k account set up as I took out the money for economic hardship awhile ago, but now that I'm more stable financially and will be even more-so with this new job, I'd like to start contributing to retirement while I'm young to maximize my savings (I'm 24 years old). 

I was planning on using Quickbooks to track my business expenses (internet and things of the such as it's a work from home job) as I could then import everything easily to TurboTax at the end of the year. However, if there's a better solution, I'm open to ideas as well!

Delving into what I mentioned earlier, I've lived my entire life in Wisconsin, but I'm currently living in Spain (I'm here as a legal resident because I'm married to a Spaniard). We're planning on moving back to the US within a year or so, so I was likely just going to (for tax purposes) use Wisconsin as my residency as I still maintain my US address, bank accounts, etc., unless it's beneficial tax-wise to say that I live abroad. 

Lots of information, I know, but I wanted to make sure that you were well informed on my situation in order to best assist me with my questions, which, here they are ...

1) How much should I set aside quarterly for taxes (how much for federal and how much for state) based on a total annual income of $50,000?  
2) What would be a good amount monthly to deposit into an IRA account in order to maximize my retirement savings? What's a good company where I could open an IRA account?   
3) Would it be more beneficial to file as a US citizen living abroad or as a Wisconsin resident?  
4) Is there anything else I should know about being an independent contractor that is good to know?

The S&amp;P 500 ended up down about 20%, developed markets in dollar terms are down about 24% according to the price action in IEFA, and we're down about 18% in emerging markets (IEMG).  Global equities were worth about $90 trillion at the start, and are about $72 trillion today.  Does that mean we've hit the bottom?  Do we have another 20% or even 40% to go?  No one really knows.  I'm just a random guy on the internet, but hopefully this helps or at least gives some folks food for thought.

&amp;#x200B;

The bear case seems obvious, unprecedented supply chain disruption, long-lived demand destruction, highly leveraged companies going bankrupt with the whole junk market imploding, contagion, hospital systems being overwhelmed, liquidity seizing up, mass foreclosures from people not being able to work, commercial real estate failures, oil and gas companies laying off tons of employees killing further demand etc... Bears are always convinced that the world is going to end, and these are all good reasons to be bearish, but there's always something worrying the markets that the markets have to climb over, whether it's trade wars or actual wars.

&amp;#x200B;

The bull case seems less obvious (which is not a bad sign, usually the time to buy is when all the bulls have bought 7 layers of dip and are all dead, in hiding, or converted to the bear army like in 2009).  With that said, there's substantial tail winds in the market.  Pandemics, whether it's H1N1, SARS, MERS, even the Spanish flu, only have a material economic effect of at most a year when it comes to virulence for a couple of reasons.  It's a combination of existing drugs that help (some anti-virals for other drugs already help against coronavirus), antibiotics to soften the secondary issues like bacterial pneumonia, the fact that less dangerous mutations tend to be successful and more dangerous ones die off so mortality rate drops over time, and herd immunity, I don't expect we'll be talking about coronavirus really beyond this year, and possibly not materially even 3-4 months from now.  Gas prices are dropping fast and that's putting money into the pockets of consumers, and it'll help soften the blow for many businesses like airlines (most are still unhedged), trucking, shipping, etc... Even if you don't believe Chinese numbers (which is fair imho), the S. Korean numbers are reliable and show that you don't need incredibly draconian  measures to resolve the coronavirus threat.   

&amp;#x200B;

Interest rates are going to be cut globally, and we had a trailing P/E of about 15.3 if you take VT, which was at 16.8 at the end of Feb and apply today's prices.  Assuming this year is a wash after a brutal Q1, Q2, and a still bad Q3, by 2021 we'll likely be back to around a forward P/E of 15 or so globally (obviously cheaper in emerging/developed non-US, more expensive US).  Jobs numbers were actually still really strong in the US and fine globally before this happened, there will be a ton of pent up demand and possibly a baby boom with all the quarantines in 9 months.  With interest rates at effectively 0, institutions, pension funds, and even retail investors, all of whom collectively are sitting on very low yield bonds and tons of cash, and who are hoping to retire can't stay in 10 year t-bills for long, and will come rushing back once the market looks even remotely ok (which will be well before the headlines start to improve).  Add to that whatever fiscal stimulus comes out of this, and it does seem like we'll get a ton of fiscal stimulus (even the Germans are doing it, which I never thought I'd see), and it's easy to see that stocks are the only game in town for long-term appreciation and a 2021 PE of 15 is a bargain in a 0% interest rate world, and ripe for future multiple expansion and EPS growth.    

&amp;#x200B;

So what's the play here?  We have two risks.  The short term risk for the bulls is that it keeps going down, and you could've gotten in for 20% (or more) on sale later.  The long-term for bears is similar to selling in 2008, if they wait too long and don't get back in until it's obvious that things are fine because they think the rally is fake or a double dip is coming, they'll have lost out heavily as well in potential appreciation.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's how I'm advising friends and family right now, given the likely market psychology of these three groups of people on average, and please take it with a huge grain of salt as I'm just a random internet stranger.  

&amp;#x200B;

The easy money has already been made, buying puts on cruise lines 3 weeks ago made sense, buying puts on cruise lines or oil and gas companies when they're already down 80% (like NCLH or OXY), the risk/reward calculus is very different and even bad news can cause the stocks to moon if it's not as bad as expected.  

&amp;#x200B;

If you're heavily to entirely cash now, I would respectfully suggest that it's time to deploy some of that cash, even if you are incredibly bearish, because if we do have a V-shaped rally, odds are you aren't getting back in and will keep waiting for a dip that'll never come. At a minimum, take a 5%-10% leg in, and if you think America is screwed, buy emerging market equities where they allegedly appear to have this already under control and that are trading at 2016 levels now with much cheaper valuations, or buy some US blue chips like Alphabet that should be very resilient even in a bear market.

&amp;#x200B;

If you are subsantially cash (e.g. 20%-40% cash position), it may be worth waiting.  If the equity markets do recover, you'll still capture a lot of that upside, but the market may very well keep going down rapidly from here (heck, it was down about 10% more on Thursday) and could go up or down 10% on Monday and no one would really be that surprised.  You have limited dry powder, and if you miss the first leg up with some cash, you're still mostly in the market, and it may be worth trying to save some money on the chance we get once in a lifetime prices on some of these individual stocks or indexes that you've been looking at.  I've also found that people who keep some cash, generally, the cash helps to avoid panic and capitulation when markets go down since you win a little either way in either higher portfolio prices or cheaper entry points.  This way, you'll also kick yourself whether it goes up or down, but if it goes down another 10% it's time start averaging in too.  

&amp;#x200B;

If you're all-in or less than 20% cash, the only way you screw up at this point is if you panic and lock in losses, best thing to do at this point is to avoid all that stress like you've been doing, keep DCA the whole way, and it'll be a blip when you look at your portfolio 10 years from now and you'll be glad you ignored all the noise.

Also, there is a personal loan subreddit but you need 1k karma to post and larger loans aren't generally funded there.  


Backstory:  


I've had relatively poor credit for right around 7 years now when I ran up a credit card in college and took a charge off on it.  Recently that mark has been removed from my report helping it pretty exponentially.  Additionally, I've carried about 6K in CC debt for a majority of that time (paying some down during tax time then inevitably building it back up).  To free up credit I took out a 7K loan with Onefinancial and planned just eating all the interest as I look to build up my credit. An emergency car repair and vet bill wiped out most of that credit I had gained so I was back to ground 0 but now with a high interest loan. I'm not necessarily bad with money, it's more so I've been working in pretty low paying entry level jobs and trying to support myself and my mother as she's been out of work due to disability/medical issues and in debt her whole life.  I work at a university so I'm inevitably always in a college town where apartment pricing is pretty absurd.  I've always lived in low income areas just to try and save money on housing but still pay a significant portion of my income to rent/utilities.  


In November 2019 I was hired for a new job a few states away from where I was, a really great paying job (went from 30k/year to 75k/year).  I didn't have enough fluid cash to pay off my current apartment lease (3k), pay pet deposit and 1st/last months rent at new apartment (\~2K), and moving expenses for renting a Uhaul and dolly to tow my car behind (\~1k).  Due to a pretty poor credit score (experian shows 625 at that time, and those ""additional fico scores are all below 600) I took out an additional 3K loan with Onemain Financial as they were still the only people who would loan me money.  


I'm happy to report i'm aggressively paying off debt.  I've already cleared $7,500/$7,500 of credit card debt with tax money and the additional revenue from my new job (was reimbursed moving expenses of $2,400).   This has been the biggest help in getting **my credit score from a 591 all the way up to \~680 today!**    


I'm saving up (with my GF) to hopefully purchase a home as i'll be here for the long run at the end of my 12 month lease (December 2020) so building up my savings/checking account is a priority now that CC's are paid off.  With current projections i'll have roughly $15,000 in fluid cash by December of this year which will be fantastic for a down payment and other home purchasing costs.    


Question:  


Knowing I do not want to inject that cash into the Onemain Loan, does anyone have any recommendations on lenders I would have a good chance of getting a lower interest rate with to refinance.  As soon as the home purchase is done I plan to aggressively pay the loan off, the issue is I am just paying SOOOO much in interest for Onemain.  On my most recent statement, paying the minimum (which is all I've factored into the budget for the next year) i'm only paying $20 towards the loan principle, which is absurd as that's not even enough to cover the balance daily growth.    Any help is welcomed (and thanks for reading)!   


PAYMENT AMOUNT - $337.35  
CHARGES/INTEREST - $317.28

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning March 16th, 2020.

# **Stocks are expected to see more wild swings, even if Fed makes big policy move  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/13/stocks-are-expected-to-see-more-wild-swings-even-if-fed-makes-big-policy-move.html)**
*****
&gt; Now that stocks have entered a bear market, more wild volatility is expected in the week ahead as investors await a big policy move by the Federal Reserve.
*****
&gt; The Federal Reserve meets Tuesday and Wednesday and is expected by some economists to take its benchmark federal funds target range back to zero, as the economy looks more and more like it could fall into a recession, due to the impact of the coronavirus.
*****
&gt; In the past week, the market was sharply lower but swung wildly in both directions, including the stunning 10% decline in the Dow Thursday, the worst one-day drop since the 1987 market crash followed by Friday’s 9.3% gain, the best day in more than 11 years.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 ended up 9.3% Friday at 2,711, its best day since Oct. 28, 2008. The S&amp;P is now 20.2% below its February high.
*****
&gt; Strategists say the market purge is not over, though it could be closer to a bottom, with some expecting the S&amp;P 500 to fall through 2,400 before it finds a floor.
*****
&gt; “You could say we’re pricing a garden variety recession,” said Lori Calvasina, chief U.S. equities strategist at RBC. “We come up with a range of 2,300 to 2,600 as recession territory.” She said the average drop during a recession, since the 1930s, was 32%. The S&amp;P had been as much as 29% off its Feb. 19 high.
*****
&gt; “If [S&amp;P] went below 2,300, it would be telling you the market is pricing in something worse than a recession, In the financial crisis we lost 57% and in the tech bubble, we lost 49%,” said Calvasina.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 was down 8.9% for the week, its worst loss since the week of Feb. 28.
*****
&gt; “I think we needed to get through this week, in particular — the one where the country went into shut down and now get the second go around of policy response. If they really do bring out the bazookas we should be darn close” to the bottom, said Barry Knapp, Ironsides Macroeconomics director of research.
*****
&gt; But strategists also point out that the coronavirus is unpredictable and it is hard to say when it will peak, even though many economists expect a bounce back in economic growth by the fourth quarter.
*****
&gt; President Donald Trump declared a state of emergency Friday, which allows him to tap federal agencies to provide emergency funds and other responses to the crisis. The president also announced the government would buy oil to fill the Strategic Petroleum Reserves and that 1.4 million test kits would be available in the next week.
*****
&gt; Markets will also be looking for further action, which the Trump administration says could include targeted financial aid to industries that are hard hit, like airlines.
*****
&gt; As communities around the country attempt to stop the spread of the virus, the potential hit to the economy grows. Companies have told workers to work from home, universities are shutting campuses, a handful of states closed public schools, and major sporting and other events have been canceled.
*****
&gt; “If it indeed is declared a recession, it will really only be a three-month drop in activity,” said Knapp. “In 2008, the household sector had the highest debt levels it ever had, and the household sector was in no position to respond to stimulus. This is quite different.”
*****
&gt; “We see where are are today is pricing in a recession. It went from a growth scare down to recession territory,” said Calvasina. She said the market is not ready to move higher yet. “I think something else we’ve got to see in addition to extreme panic ratings from the sentiment indicators, we do need to see the news flow get better on the virus.”
*****
&gt; Investors will continue to look for more action from Washington, and in the coming week it will also be the Fed’s policy response that could drive the market.
*****
&gt; “In light of the continued growth in coronavirus cases in the US and globally, the sharp further tightening in financial conditions, and rising risks to the economic outlook, we now expect the FOMC to cut the funds rate 100bp on March 18, a faster return to the crisis-era 0-0.25% rate than under our previous call for two 50bp steps in March and April,” Goldman economists wrote.
*****
&gt; The Fed on Thursday announced a significant increase in funds available for its repo operations, to provide liquidity for the short term funding markets. It also said it would purchase a broad range of Treasury securities, across maturities, with the $60 billion it currently uses to buy Treasury bills on a monthly basis.
*****
&gt; Economists say the Fed could announce other policy moves, like purchases of mortgage securities. Some expect it to return to a “patient” stance, showing a willingness to keep rates extremely low for a long time.
*****
&gt; Analysts have been watching the corporate bond market, where spreads blew out dramatically in the past week, particularly in high yield. Calvasina said she is not yet concerned.
*****
&gt; “We’ve got problems in energy. We have problems in some hospitality related industries. There are pockets of stress, but for me, when I look across most S&amp;P companies’ balance sheets are in really good shape,” Calvasina said. “I don’t think this is a prolonged sort of downturn.”

# Signs Of A Washout?

&gt; The S&amp;P 500 Index’s historic slide continued yesterday, culminating in nearly a 10% loss for the day, and leaving the benchmark index officially in bear market territory, just 16 trading days after setting a record high on February 19. In addition, the S&amp;P 500 has now moved more than 4% each day this week, leaving investors and professionals alike wondering when this volatility could end. While nobody knows for sure, one thing we always look for at market bottoms are signs of extremes, both from a sentiment and price perspective.

&gt; From an anecdotal sentiment perspective, certainly fears of COVID-19 have reached the masses, with travel plans canceled and announcements of major events called off coming nearly every hour. However, investor survey data shows a similar story with the American Association of Individual Investors (AAII) Investor Sentiment Survey showing the highest percentage of bears since April 2013. In addition, the National Association of Active Investment Managers (NAAIM) Exposure Index, which represents the average exposure to US equity markets by the surveyed investment managers, reached its lowest level since September 2015. Following each of those instances, the S&amp;P 500 rallied more than 13% over the next year.

&gt; Another way of gauging sentiment can be from the internals of the market. While the S&amp;P 500 is now well below its 200-day moving average, that doesn’t mean each stock in the index has moved below its respective 200-day moving average. In fact, regardless of the broad market’s trend, when less than 20% of the individual components of the index are trading below their 200-day moving averages, it is considered an extreme. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, Thursday’s sell-off left less 6% of the S&amp;P 500 there, a number last seen in March 2009. “These are truly frightening times,” explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “However, it is important to remember that the signs of panic we are seeing are typically found at or near major market lows.”

# The Fastest Bear Market Ever

&gt; The historic volatility continues, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average officially setting its fastest move from a new all-time high to a bear market (down 20% from the highs) in the 124-year history of the index. It took only 19 days for this to take place, which is far and away the new record.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Bear-market-1-1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Not to be outdone, the S&amp;P 500 Index is set to close down 20% from all-time highs today, doing this in only 16 days. Again, as of the time we are writing this blog, the S&amp;P 500 is in bear market territory, but there always could be a chance for a late-day rally.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Bear-market-2.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; “From major sports postponing their seasons, to travel bans to Europe, the economic impact of the coronavirus is growing exponentially with each passing day,” said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Markets are pricing in a potential recession and inevitable second quarter slowdown, but it is all about expectations. Should the virus be contained and the worst-case scenarios not materialize, now could be a nice opportunity for longer-term investors.”

&gt; Last, one of Warren Buffett’s most famous quotes is, “Be fearful when others are greedy and be fearful when others are fearful.” We’ve seen many signs of extreme fear the past few days, but the CNN Fear &amp; Greed Index hitting 1 earlier today is quite a historic level of fear. This proprietary indicator looks at multiple inputs (like put/call ratios, momentum, and volatility), but on a scale of 1-100, this morning’s 1 is the lowest level ever seen, besting the 2 it hit at the lows in December 2018. From a contrarian point of view, this could be quite meaningful.

# Perspectives on Waterfall Declines

&gt; Volatile market action over the several weeks warrants some much needed perspective into the history of these types of waterfall declines. Fortunately, we have this research on hand and have been examining the nature of deep, fast selloffs like we have experience here in early 2020 as well as the nature of the inevitable and often sharp recoveries.

&gt; First of all yes, this time is different – and yet it’s not. The headline causes of each of these historic waterfall declines are all different and yet investor, trader and money manager behavior remains rather similar. Fear has once again exposed the market’s overvaluation and weaknesses. This time it’s the fear of the coronavirus pandemic and price war in the oil market that spills over into the rest of the financial.

&gt; Like the previous occurrences of waterfall declines in the table and graphs below the market reacted to fear and sold off fast and hard. It’s too early to tell if this waterfall decline is over or how fast and far the recovery will be. As we continue to analyze the current situation a thorough review of the history of waterfall declines and their subsequent recoveries should provide some much needed perspective.

# Friday 13th, DJIA Attempting to Recover &amp; End Losing Friday Streak

&gt; Friday is a significant day of the week because it is the last day of trading and positions held over the weekend could be at higher risk of an exogenous event or an unanticipated headline. Pages 143 &amp; 144 of the Stock Trader’s Almanac 2020 show the difference in Friday performance during bull and bear markets. Friday’s have been weaker in bear markets.

&gt; However today, on a Friday the 13th of all days, DJIA is fighting to recover some of its losses this week and to end its streak of down Fridays at seven. Down Friday DJIA losing streaks of seven or more, like the current streak, are actually somewhat rare in history. Prior to this year, DJIA has had just six similar or longer down Friday streaks going back to 1950. The last streak of down Fridays was in March and April of 2017. The longest streak lasted nine Fridays beginning on the last Friday of 2000 and lasting into February 2001.

 &gt; In the above chart the 30 trading days before and the 60 trading days after the last six DJIA down Friday losing streaks of seven or more have been plotted to display the average performance before and after the last down Friday of the streak. (There are on average 21 trading days in a typical calendar month) Weakness and lower was the trend during the down Friday streak, but once the streak came to an end, DJIA was higher 60 trading days later.

# Last Stocks Above Their Moving Averages

&gt; The massive declines over the past few weeks have left conditions extremely oversold. As we highlighted in yesterday's Sector Snapshot, breadth has been awful while there is no longer a single stock in the S&amp;P 500 that is overbought (1 or more standard deviations above its 50-DMA). In fact, after yesterday's absolute washout, there is only a small handful of stocks that are above their 50 and 200-DMAs. In regards to the 50-DMA, less than 1% of stocks in the S&amp;P 500 are above this average which is the first time that has happened since 2011. The only time in between that saw a similarly weak reading, although not quite hitting that under 1% requirement was back in December of 2018 when 1.19% of stocks were above their 50-DMA. As for the 200-DMA, only 5.59% are above that level. That is the lowest reading since March of 2009.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/MAs.png))**

&gt; The average stock is now 26.56% below its 50-day and 24.5% below its 200-day. The table below shows those 22 remaining stocks that are still above their 200-DMAs as of yesterday's close and the few that are also below their 50-DMA. Of these, only Regeneron (REGN), Kroger (KR), Digital Realty Trust (DLR), and Gilead Sciences (GILD) are also above their 50-DMAs. The only other stock in the index that is also above its 50-DMA is Cabot Oil and Gas (COG), though it is 11% below its 200-DMA. While these stocks have all held above their long term moving average recently, only GILD and REGN have risen since the index's high on 2/19.

# Selloff Erases All of US Market Cap Gains Since Election Day 2016

&gt; With the US stock market down nearly 7% yet again today, the total market cap of US companies as measured by the Russell 3,000 has fallen $11.5 trillion in less than a month. On February 19th, total US market cap was just over $35 trillion. It's at $23.8 trillion as of this morning.

&gt; What makes this drop even more noteworthy is that $23.8 trillion was the market cap of US companies on Election Day 2016. At this point in time, all of the market cap gains seen since President Trump's election victory have been wiped out.

# Low Rates Send Mortgage Applications Surging

&gt; Coronavirus fears have broadly sent rates lower over the past month. Currently, the national average for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage stands at 3.68%; just off the low of 3.55% from earlier in the month. With mortgage rates now basically at their lowest levels since late 2016, homeowners have been quickly enticed to jump on these lower rates.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/MRNA.png))**

&gt; Last week, weekly mortgage applications from the Mortgage Bankers Association showed a roughly 15% surge as rates were reaching record lows. In the time since then, the Fed's 50 bps cut came into effect and yields fell even further which led mortgage applications this week to surge 55.4%. That is the highest week over week increase in mortgage applications since November of 2008 when they had risen 112.1%. Outside of that period, we've only seen larger weekly increases a few other times since 1990.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/MA-1.png))**

&gt; The spike was driven largely by refinancing applications which rose 78.6% week-over-week. As with the composite, that was the biggest weekly jump in refi applications since the housing bubble. Prior to that, once again you would need to go back to 2001 or the 1990s to find larger weekly increases in mortgage refinance applications.

If they try and bailout everyone, the cost could run to 20T or more based on some rough calculations.  I fully expect this sickness to be around for the 1.5 - 2 years it takes to HOPEFULLY get a working vaccine.  

Maybe I'm just fearmongering.  I'm stunned gold is not going up.

Trump is the kinda guy who wants easy, quick fixes to everything.  His idea of just throwing money at the problem, in my mind, is crazy.  He basically is raging at the FED everyday for not doing MORE.  They already pumped 1.5T and cut rates.  It's crazy.  I guess he wants negative rates, he said that today.  He would also like many trillions just pumped directly into stocks.  In his mind that fixes the economy.  I'm scared.

Banking,Auto Loan Approval,"Hello, 

I am looking to get a truck in May, and am curious if I would get approved for financing a piece of it and also if that is even possible. It's a long story, but for the sake of simplicity:

FICO: 739

Down payment: $32,000

Truck cost: $45,000 after tax/fees (dealer auction, have dealers license through my mom)

W2 Income: $26,000

Actual total income (construction w moms co under table+side jobs): $45,000

Being 20 and a full time student I am a little anxious, I feel like they will deny me having just about 1.5 years of credit history (though perfect history, no missed payments, 3 structured CC's &amp; 0% recorded utilization). I want to finance the truck for a couple of reasons: I do not want to over extend myself by just paying cash and clearing out my savings, interest rates at my CU are at 2.99%, and admittedly I want to spend a few thousand on modifications (yeah I know, stupid kid) AND this diversifies my credit history (not a selling point but it's worth noting IMO). **Main Q:** does DTI factor largely into what I will be approved for?

personalfinance,"If you do a backdoor Roth IRA, be careful using Credit Karma Tax","I know this is a somewhat specific issue, but I wanted to share about my experience with Credit Karma Tax this year.  I have a pretty straight forward return (standard deduction, one state).  Probably the most complicated part is the backdoor Roth IRA (which shouldn't be that complicated).  

I went through all the forms before I filed and everything looked great.  I downloaded the forms immediately after filing, but somehow the state received a different return than the IRS.  The difference in my state refund was as if my IRA conversion was taxable.  

Now when I log into my account, I have an ""accepted"" tax return (which is what the state received but not the IRS), and a ""current"" tax return, which matches what I expected (and what the IRS received).

Credit karma has not helped at all despite multiple attempts.  Examples of responses I have gotten:  

* I understand you have concerns on why the amount have changed typically when you make changes to the file once submitted that's the form it creates [blaming me for updating the return, not addressing the fact that the IRS and state received 2 different returns]
* I'm not sure how you can have 2 returns since the product will only allow one. [Chat disconnected after that]

Lately I noticed when I first log in, in the upper right, the calculation has the incorrect amounts in it.  When I refresh, it shows the correct amounts.  Something is clearly up with how their product handles this situation.

Although I've sent a followup email to them, I don't have any confidence they are going to do anything about it and am just going to file an amended return myself.  

tl;dr - Credit Karma sent different returns to federal and state.  The difference was how it treated the IRA conversion.  CK has been of no help.",finance
investing,Here's what could really sink the global economy: $19 trillion in risky corporate debt,"London (CNN Business) - Companies have spent the years since the global financial crisis binging on debt. Now, as the coronavirus pandemic threatens to push the world into recession, the bill could come due — exacerbating damage to the economy and feeding a meltdown in financial markets.

Looking to take advantage of low interest rates, companies have rushed in recent years to issue bonds whose proceeds could be used to grow their businesses. Corporate debt among non-banks exploded to $75 trillion at the end of 2019, up from $48 trillion at the end of 2009, according to the Institute of International Finance.

As the coronavirus spreads — touching off a plunge in oil prices and a collapse in travel, and shutting factories from Italy to China — there is increasing alarm that companies in the energy, hospitality and auto sectors won't be able to make their bond payments. That could trigger a spree of ratings downgrades and defaults that would further destabilize financial markets and compound the economic shock.

personalfinance,Employer says I cannot contribute to 2019 HSA anymore,"[context- country: usa, state: ca]
I'm on a HSA plan through my employer and employer makes regular contribution to it. While preparing the tax return, I realized I did not max-out the 2019 HSA. I contact my employer and we discuss starting contributing to 2020 HSA via payroll deduction which somehow led to them informing me that I can no longer make any personal contributions to the HSA for the 2019 tax year from my post-tax money. From what I've researched, I can make a bank transfer from my savings account to the HSA and claim that as a federal tax deduction. I understand I won't get the payroll taxes back on this amount but I can still make the 2019 contribution until April 2020. Their reasoning is, ""you'll no longer be able to contribute funds, since it's attached to a employer health plan"". My employer is a pretty big company and so I do want to believe the advice from the finance department but my research says something different. My questions are as follows..

Part 1: Should I make the personal contribution to the HSA for tax year 2019, despite what I've been told?

Part 2: I'm considering opening up a Fidelity HSA and making the 2019 personal contributions to that instead of the employer sponsored HealthEquity. Going forward, I'll set up a periodic transfer from HealthEquity to Fidelity and invest there. Is this something that is doable? Would I have to report every transfer from HealthEquity to Fidelity in the 2020 tax return? Should I instead do a one time HSA to HSA transfer every year to make things easier?

Bitcoin,"Am I the only one who has 0 intent to sell any of my bitcoin under $100,000 USD?","People said bitcoin would never break $1. Then they said it would never hit $100. Then they said it would never hit $1,000. Then when it crashed back to $200, people said it was going to die. When it hit $4,000, people said it would never hit 10k, then 20k.

Now that's it's at $5k, people say it's over. It's not unreasonable to think that, within 5-6 years, bitcoin will have another spike (or two or three). It's not unreasaonble to think the 100k barrier will be broken some day.

With that in mind, is it crazy for me not to want to sell any of my bitcoins under $100k? People say I should sell some if it hits 20k again, or at 25k, 30k... I'm not interested. Really waiting for it to be much higher. Who would I sell for 25k in 1-2-3 years when I could sell for 100k+ in 4-5-6 years?

Right now, the entire bitcoin market cap is less than Tesla. It's 6% of the newest QE by FED. It's 5% of Apple. And that's counting bitcoins that are gone for good. 

I think bitcoin is worth more than that. I sincerely believe more than 100B has been, or will be shortly, invested in bitcoins. Think about all the miners, electricity, transactions fees... This has to amount to billions per year.  People are investing for the long term. Even big funds are starting to grab it. There will be bitcoin ETF soon. 

Also, have you tried to send money overseas recently? The only way I know of is credit card and a) it's riddled with fraud b) 5%+ transaction fee, strict limits and money can be frozen for 180 days.

personalfinance,Optimizing tax liabilities,"Hello,

I don't see anything in the wiki related to this topic, and I want a sanity check.

Since I got my bonus recently, I decided to take a shot at optimizing my tax bill for 2020. I figure trying to avoid paying the 22% federal tax is worth it since it's such a big jump from the 12% bracket. I'd be right on the cusp, and the way I see it, if I can stay just below that 22% it's the difference between buying power of $.88 and $.78 for each dollar I put in my Roth. I'm 1 year into my career and anticipate my retirement income will be significantly higher than my current income.

I get a 6% match on retirement contributions. I have 6% going to the company Roth IRA, and 1% set up to go to a 401 (k) for the rest of the year - simply to lower my taxable income. My total monthly combined retirement/HSA payment is pretty hefty relative to what I make, but I have ~6 months of expenses in a HYS account; and I overestimated my monthly expense budget by about $100 just in case, so I won't have to draw on that. If expenses increase unexpectedly, I can simply contribute less to retirement as needed.

|Est Income| 57,251|Total salary incl. 2019 bonus paid in 2020 + HYS interest|
:--|:--|:--|
|Single Exemption| 12,400||
|Taxable income| 44,851||
|Student loan deduction| 800|Estimated annual student loan interest paid - loan 1 - 4.74%|
|Student loan deduction| 250|Estimated annual student loan interest paid - loan 2 - 4.2%|
|HSA Deduction| 2,960|Total anticipated 2020 contributions to HSA (not including 450+ from employer)|
|401(k) Deduction| 1,063|Total anticipated 2020 401(k) contributions|
|Taxable Income after deductions| 40,028||


This would just keep me from paying 22% on any income or Roth contributions, provided I don't get a higher paying job (I do plan staying here at least another year) start an income-generating hobby, make bank if I yolo some FDs etc. If I'm +/- a couple hundred or so, I can just top off the last few bucks in the HSA (occasionally employer contributes for things like taking a biometric screening so I left some leeway) or throw it in the 401(k).

I don't see a need to increase my HYS, aggressively pay down my debt, and I have ""fun money"" for vacations, recreational classes, eating out, etc built into my monthly budget. Is this the way to go?",finance
Bitcoin,50% our bitcoin community are haters,"For the past days I've seen many people bashing bitcoin non-stop after the last loss in 50% of bitcoin value, I've checked many profiles of these people and recognized that these people never comment, never communicate, they are just waiting for the right moment to bash bitcoin out of hate.

&amp;#x200B;

I've seen many people bashing bitcoin for being bad store of value, lets look at few facts here:

* Bitcoin is the only representation of free market today, every other asset is traded mostly by derivatives in the stock market, which are keeps on being pumped with newly created dollars by the fed,
* You can't halt bitcoin trading, it's being accessible to people choices 24/7, unlike the stock market that could be halted for 15 mins so insiders can make some OTC trades in order to provide liquidity so the price won't continue falling.
* The fed does not pump dollars (your taxes) to keep bitcoin from crashing, unlike the stock market which is the main thing Trump cares about and takes it as the representation of the economy.

Final conclusion guys, for me, I've been in the game since 2014, since then I've seen much, learnt much, and read much.

As of right now, I'd suggest all REAL bitcoin HODLERS to remember why they have firstly invested, and stick to the plan, I know it have been harsh days, but making portfolio changes based on what you have read on reddit makes the situation even worse. And if it's really hard for you, get off the net for few days.",cryptocurrency

worldpolitics,Trumps Lust For Screwing Citizens Over Religious Retardation ~ Jewish Redundancy,"It's always some stupid band aid solution when it comes to the religiously retarded because they want to evade acknowledging that their filthy religious foundation of factually proven lies have already lead to thousands of years of war and divide and to the death of millions if not billions of people to this very day yet these deliberately ignorant, selfish and greedy imbeciles try and blame anyone or anything else for what their disgusting religious filth causes hence they have the audacity to whine hate crime while they support the so called hate crime by supporting their filthy religious lies after thousands of years proving where such followings lead time and time again quite obviously.  
 Take a look at the history of jews, they go around acting as if their religion is not to blame for anything yet if you research thousands of years of history you will find jews were slaughtered and evicted from almost every part of the old world including israel on a couple of occasions. Yet they continue to lie claiming it is everyone else's or anything else's fault while ignoring where their sick following has proven to lead them time and time again and long before what they call the holocaust which is just another example of their religious filth leading to war and divide yet again. The holocaust, the Germans were nice enough to offer the jews a place to escape genocide but just like pretty much everywhere else the jews went, the Germans finally got fed up with religious rhetoric plaguing their country in such mass numbers and when no other country wanted to take such mass numbers so began what they call the holocaust when the world stepped up (primarily USA) to send them back over to israel where they are right back at war with the muslims again.  
 Oh and funny thing, if you research their history you are likely to find the same old story where the jews start attempting to turn citizens of such countries they invade into sexually retarded imbeciles to try and make Jews look superior like they are the one's with heads on their shoulders to go too for guidance meanwhile from what I have come across, they are the one's forcing such sick and filthy lgbt lies and deceptions as they have already apparently been doing for hundreds of years in several other countries throughout history. Gee who do we have to thank for our children being sexually mutilated and our bloodlines cut short over a bunch of sick and filthy lies?!  
 Funny thing, look how Germany and all western civs who refused to take such mass numbers of jews are now being infiltrated for divide and conquer by this globalist crime organization which appears to be intended to make the holocaust look like a little wee needle in a hay stack by comparison to what is currently transpiring in modern day heading many western civs towards our destruction under the guidance of such pathetic and retarded imbeciles.  
 They also have the nerve to try and put all of the blame on China for what goes on and Funny thing about Trump, he boosted the lgbt insanity with his pageant rhetoric years ago and these days he doesn't even address such sick filth and keeps going on about winning while cowering from real issues and placing band aid failure solutions like trying to criminalize people from speaking out against some filthy disgusting low life group of religious selfish, greedy and ignorant imbeciles. He's doing what muslims are doing while encouraging that it's ok for muslims to do it because he is doing it for some other filthy religion thus further escalating war and divide. It's no secret now that freedom of religion eventually endorses islamic take over yet Trump treats his citizens like a lump of stupid idiots going on about freedom of religious garage which is pretty much ensuring that somewhere down the road that the inevitable will eventually happen. This reveals to me to evidence pointing towards Trump being a sneaky back stabbing globalist.  
 Hey attempting to silence USA citizens from speaking against filthy religious trash, gee being history keeps repeating itself because dummies are unable to learn after thousands of years, looks like it might not be long before people are fed up and expel the jews from North America too so you can thank Trump for perhaps speeding up such a process by forcing such rubbish on USA citizens as criminalizing speaking against such sickly and pathetic religious trash.  
Unlike the religious I happen to value human life more than I value factually proven foundations of filthy religious lies which have already lead to thousands of years of war and divide which is why it is my pleasure to fight for the destruction of religion. Anti every religion, that's me and my pleasure. Say hello to free speech telling you where you can shove your religious garbage you deliberately ignorant imbeciles.

1933–1957  
First Batch of Refugee children arrive in England from Germany.  
Buchenwald survivors arrive in Haifa.  
The Nazi German persecution started with the Nazi boycott of Jewish businesses in 1933, reached a first climax during Kristallnacht in 1938 and culminated in the Holocaust of European Jewry. The British Mandate of Palestine prohibited Jewish emigration to Mandatory Palestine. The 1938 Evian Conference, the 1943 Bermuda Conference and other attempts failed to resolve the problem of Jewish refugees, a fact widely used in Nazi propaganda (see also MS St. Louis). A small number of German and Austrian Jewish refugees from Nazism emigrated to Britain, where attitudes were not necessarily positive.\[23\] Many of the refugees fought for Britain in the Second World War. After WW-II, eastern European Holocaust survivors migrated to the allied-controlled part of Europe, as the Jewish society to which most of them belonged did not exist anymore. Often they were lone survivors consumed by the often futile search for other family and friends, and often unwelcome in the towns from which they came. They were known as displaced persons (also known as Sh'erit ha-Pletah) and placed in displaced persons camps, most of which were by 1951 closed. The last camp Föhrenwald was closed in 1957.  
1947–1972  
Jewish refugees look out through the portholes of a ship while docked in the port of Haifa.  
Iraqi Jews displaced 1951.  
The Exodus bringing in refugees.  
In the course of the operation ""Magic Carpet"" (1949–1950), the entire community of Yemenite Jews (called Teimanim, about 49,000) immigrated to Israel.  
The Jewish exodus from Arab and Muslim countries, in which the combined population of Jewish communities of the Middle East and North Africa (excluding Israel) was reduced from about 900,000 in 1948 to under 8,000 today, and approximately 600,000 of whom became citizens of Israel. The history of the exodus is politicized, given its proposed relevance to a final settlement Israeli–Palestinian peace negotiations.\[24\]\[25\]\[26\]\[27\]\[28\]\[29\] When presenting the history, those who view the Jewish exodus as equivalent to the 1948 Palestinian exodus, such as the Israeli government and NGOs such as JJAC and JIMENA, emphasize ""push factors"", such as cases of anti-Jewish violence and forced expulsions,\[24\] and refer to those affected as ""refugees"".\[24\] Those who argue that the exodus does not equate to the Palestinian exodus emphasize ""pull factors"", such as the actions of local Jewish Agency for Israel officials aiming to fulfil the One Million Plan,\[26\] highlight good relations between the Jewish communities and their country's governments,\[28\] emphasize the impact of other push factors such as the decolonization in the Maghreb and the Suez War and Lavon Affair in Egypt,\[28\] and argue that many or all of those who left were not refugees.\[24\]\[26\]  
Then UNHCR announced in February 1957 and in July 1967, that these Jews who had fled from Arab countries ""may be considered prima facie within the mandate of this office,"" so according them in international law, as bona fide refugees.\[citation needed\]  
1947  
Egypt passed the Companies' Law. This law required that no less than 75% of employees of companies in Egypt must be Egyptian citizens. This law strongly affected Jews, as only about 20% of all Jews in Egypt were Egyptian citizens. The rest, although in many cases born in Egypt and living there for generations, did not hold Egyptian citizenship.\[30\]  
1948  
State of Israel established. Antisemitism in Egypt strongly intensified. On May 15, 1948, emergency law was declared, and a royal decree forbade Egyptian citizens to leave the country without a special permit. This was applied to Jews. Hundreds of Jews were arrested and many had their property confiscated. In June through August 1948, bombs were planted in Jewish neighborhoods and Jewish businesses looted. About 250 Jews were killed or wounded by the bombs. Roughly 14,000 Jews left Egypt between 1948–50.\[30\]  
1949  
Jordan occupies and then annexes the West Bank – largely allotted by the 1947 UN Partition of Palestine to an Arab state, proposal rejected by the Arab leadership – and conducts large scale discrimination and persecution of all non-Muslim residents – Jewish, Christian (of many denominations), Druze, Circassian, etc. – and forces Arabisation of all public activity, including schools and public administration.\[31\]  
1954  
Gamal Abdel Nasser seizes power in Egypt. Nasser immediately arrested many Jews who were tried on various charges, mainly for Zionist and communist activities. Jews were forced to donate large sums of money to the military. Strict supervision of Jewish enterprises was introduced; some were confiscated and others forcibly sold to the government.\[30\]  
1956  
Suez Crisis. Roughly 3,000 Egyptian Jews were interned without charge in four detention camps. The government ordered thousands of Jews to leave the country within a few days, and they were not allowed to sell their property, nor to take any capital with them. The deportees were made to sign statements agreeing not to return to Egypt and transferring their property to the administration of the government. The International Red Cross helped about 8,000 stateless Jews to leave the country, taking most of them to Italy and Greece. Most of the Jews of Port Said (about 100) were smuggled to Israel by Israel agents. The system of deportation continued into 1957. Other Jews left voluntarily, after their livelihoods had been taken from them, until only 8,561 were registered in the 1957 census. The Jewish exodus continued until there were about 3,000 Jews left as of in 1967.\[30\]  
1967  
Six-Day War. Hundreds of Egyptian Jews arrested, suffering beatings, torture, and abuse. Some were released following intervention by foreign states, especially by Spain, and were permitted to leave the country.\[30\] Libyan Jews, who numbered approximately 7,000, were subjected to pogroms in which 18 were killed, prompting a mass exodus that left fewer than 100 Jews in Libya.\[32\]  
1970  
Less than 1,000 Jews still lived in Egypt in 1970. They were given permission to leave but without their possessions. As of 1971, only 400 Jews remained in Egypt. As of 2013, only a few dozen Jews remain in Egypt.\[30\]  
1960s–1989  
Due to the 1968 Polish political crisis thousands of Jews were forced by the communist authorities to leave Poland. See also rootless cosmopolitan, Doctors' plot, Jackson-Vanik amendment, refusenik, Zionology, Pamyat.\[citation needed\]  
1962  
Jews flee Algeria as result of OAS violence. The community feared that the proclamation of independence would precipitate a Muslim outburst. By the end of July 1962, 70,000 Jews had left for France and another 5,000 for Israel. It is estimated that some 80% of Algerian Jews settled in France.\[33\]  
1965  
Situation of Jews in Algeria rapidly deteriorates. By 1969, fewer than 1,000 Jews remain. By the 1990s, the numbers had dwindled to approximately 70.\[33\]  
1970s–1990s  
State-sponsored persecution in the Soviet Union prompted hundreds of thousands of Soviet Jews, known as Refuseniks because they had been denied official permission to leave, to flee; most went to Israel or to the United States as refugees.\[34\]  
2014  
Orthodox Jews who fled from Canada after accusations of child sexual abuse expelled from Guatemala by the residents who accused them of not integrating within the culture and damaging the tourism based economy\[35\]

personalfinance,Is it better to pay off mortgage debt first or use that money to start an equity portfolio?,I guess it boils down to interest rates but the return on equities is volatile and not easy to predict over the term of a mortgage.,finance
personalfinance,Should I put money that was meant to repay back student loans into CDs or a high interest savings account? Feds frozed student loan interest.,"Graduated college early with only 16k in student loan debt. Got a job paying 56k/yr. Lots of opportunity to move up. 

First paycheck- 85% went towards student loans. Rest devoted to 401k match and to live on till next paycheck. 

I currently owe 14.5k in student loans (subsidized and unsubsidized) and had plans to pay them down aggressively (1.6k every two weeks) before grace period ends in order to pay the least amount of interest as possible on the unsubsidized loans and hopefully no interest on the subsidized loans. All loans are in grace as well, so my monthly minimum payment atm is $0.

Plan:

Now since the fed frozed student loan interest accrual. I might as well put the money that would have been paid towards the student loans into CDs or a high interest saving account. Once no interest ends, I will pay off the student loans in full. Interest earned will be used to fund Roth IRA.

Is this a good idea? Or is there a better way to approach this?",finance
investing,CNBC: Trump says he has the right to remove Powell as Fed chair but hasn't 'made any decisions' yet,"&gt; President Donald Trump launched another barrage of criticism at the Federal Reserve, saying Saturday that the central bank is behind its global peers in the economic fight against the coronavirus.

&gt; **""I'm not happy with the Fed because I think they're following not leading, and we should be leading,"" the president said during a news conference to discuss the COVID-19 outbreak and the ongoing U.S. response.**

&gt; **Since the disease's spread has intensified, the U.S. central bank has enacted an emergency interest rate of 50 basis points, opened up a liquidity program to the bank to add up to $1.5 trillion to the financial system and started buying government debt across the yield curve.**

&gt; Trump said he is not yet looking at removing Jerome Powell as chairman, though he believes he has the right to do so. He has harshly criticized Powell previously, saying the Fed should be more aggressive in easing the stance of monetary policy.

&gt; **""I have the right to remove him. No, I'm not doing that,"" Trump said. ""I also have the right to put him in a regular position and put someone else in charge, and I haven't made any decisions on that.""**

&gt; Trump likely could move Powell out as chairman. Powell's term as governor runs until 2026; Trump would need cause to remove him from that position.

&gt; The Fed has little room left to cut rates after the intermeeting reduction nearly two weeks ago. Its policy rate is now in a targeted range between 1%-1.25%. Market pricing points to the Federal Open Market Committee taking the rate to near-zero, where it was during and after the financial crisis.

&gt; As he has in the past, Trump pointed to other central banks in Europe and Japan that have policy rates less than the Fed's. The president said that in some cases it is ""two points,"" which is not accurate. 

&gt; He also insisted that the U.S. could ""refinance our debt very easily at a much lower rate.""

In fact the Fed just printed a monstrous pile of money and BTC is falling the most. Is the title statement simply false? These are genuine questions.

EDIT: The people who ridicule instantly are clearly followers who believe what others tell them and have no original ideas, or really even just thoughts, that anyone cares to hear. They can't explain why they think BTC will do poorly or well. The only certainty in life is that if you say anything negative on the Bitcoin or Apple groups you will feel the wrath of a number of 15 year old followers with Daddy issues who have nothing more original to say than ""No, you are."" They clearly also watch for any response from me on other threads and go downvote those. They lose because I don't care.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Mortage ?? does this sound like a good deal?,"My sister is trying to buy a house. Shes a first time home buyer. we dont know to much about buying a home.

personalfinance,Significant differences between TurboTax and FreeTaxUSA filings?,"In order to make sure my taxes would be filed correctly, I entered my information on 2 different sites before filing. If both sites were similar, I was going to file with the cheaper of the two, but unfortunately there are significant differences between the two:

TurboTax:

Federal: $897 DUE

Georgia (non-resident): $442 DUE

California (resident): $625 REFUND


FreeTaxUSA: 

Federal: $898 DUE (not concerned about a $1 difference)

Georgia (non-resident): $423 DUE (see below)

California (resident): $303 REFUND


So for the federal tax filing, I'm not concerned about the $1 difference.

For the Georgia non-resident filing, the $19 difference is because TurboTax says I owe a penalty to GA of $19 for not having paid my taxes as-you-go for my 1099-MISC. I agree with TurboTax, and would like to pay this $19.

But it's California that gets weird. I cannot figure out why there's such a difference. I, of course, would prefer to get $625 back, but cannot figure out how such a large difference was created, and I would rather pay or get an accurate refund as opposed to a large one. I have a feeling it has to do with my Georgia income interacting with my California income and vice versa, but I don't know what to do, and to top it all off, TurboTax costs nearly $150 extra just to file my taxes, so I'm inclined not to use it.",finance

investing,What happens if the stock and bond markets crash simultaneously?,"So we are obviously seeing a stock market crash in the past few weeks, and for a short period there was a large influx of buyers for US treasuries as we saw yields reach an all time low. My understanding is that (correct me if I'm wrong) yields have risen since then even with the fed spending billions of dollars to buy treasuries themselves which puts downward pressure on yields yet the yields continue rising. What are the implications of that? It seems to me that people are selling their bonds and demand for them is decreasing.. does that imply people want to put their money back into stocks? If the stock market continues to crash and yields continue to rise simultaneously what are the implications? Would that mean people are holding on to their cash, or is there some other ""safe haven"" that people would flock to?",finance

My biggest issue with Fedility is how long it takes for my funds to be transferred and not having access to it even after its pulled from my account.  Does anyone know of a brokerage that has limited free margin while funds are being transferred or processed after its pulled or opinions on what company you prefer over RH and Fedility?",finance
personalfinance,Buy house from sick dad and other inheritance questions- 33yo clueless and worried,"My Dad purchased the house my husband and I live in 4 years ago, a few months before we got married. We have an agreement that once we saved up enough for a loan downpayment and our credit scores were good enough to get a loan, he would sell the house to us for what he bought it for ($190k)+ cost of home renovations which comes out to $213k. It’s current value is around $265k and the neighborhood is currently being redeveloped as an entertainment district...retail and bars etc., as it’s literally the last part of our city limits (Austin) that has the space. Good for continued growth on investment. So, to give you the full picture here, I’m 33 and my husband is 37....2008 crippled us from being able to get any sort of credit line to build credit since we didn’t have any, start a career with stability, or put anything into savings when we were just starting out in life for pretty much all of our 20’s. The past few years have been good to us and we felt like we were finally getting ahead. Then, Coronavirus happened. 

My husband’s job has told him his union will pay him his 40hr paycheck for as long as they’re shut down if/when it gets to that point. I’m 1099’d with 25% ownership in a small business where we deal with alcoholic beverage compliance and licensing for other entities as well as importing wine and spirits. Clearly, less stable.... although, people do drink during bad times, so our company might be able to weather the storm, given our clients and distributors can pay us, and my 72 yo business partner who continues to disregard social distancing doesn’t get Covid 19 and die. If my company goes under, we would have at least half of our income with benefits still coming in, and continued salary increases equal to our current household income now, once hubby completes training hours and advances to full elevator mechanic in about a year. We have no kids yet, $5k in savings, and only one car loan. The habits of having to be frugal have stuck with us, so we only have about $6k of debt, all of which is student loans and medical, currently being paid down in monthly installments. 

If we were able to secure a loan with a good interest rate, should we go ahead and purchase from my Dad? Our mortgage/taxes/insurance would be slightly less than we are currently paying in rent to him, with current loan rates. What happens if our house goes down in value and we are stuck upside down on the note? Is that even a possibility? Also, it would be tight, but we could manage to pay all of our bills on husband’s current salary if I lost my income stream. Side note, he’s already had 20 hrs double overtime this week and that could become the new norm if other employees are unable to come in, so that could help cushion any loss from my end. 

I should also explain the other factors. My Dad turns 65 in August and is currently on Cobra insurance til he turns 65 and can get Medicare. He had a part of his lung removed 2 years ago due to lung cancer and was in remission. We found out in December that he has prostate cancer. He’s currently treating it with radiation. He’s extremely high risk for the virus. I’ve cried my eyes out the last week trying to convince him to self isolate, but he’s a stubborn boomer and says stuff like “That virus shit’s got nothing on me, I’m not going anywhere”. 🙄🙄🙄😭😖.  This in a city with active cases. In his will, his estate is split 3 ways between me and my two brothers. I’ll get to more on this in a minute. 

Well, today he told me he’d loan us the 20% downpayment for the house and we could pay him back at like a 2% interest rate, so we wouldn’t have to get PMI (???) or something like that. 

That brings me to these final questions:

1. Should we move as quickly as possible to secure a loan while we still have this opportunity for the 20% down loan and both still have jobs? Or would that be the dumbest thing ever in the current circumstances? 

2. What happens if we don’t get the loan and my Dad happens to die? If this were to happen, how would we be taxed on the property if we inherit it instead? 

3. Speaking of inheritance, his estate is split three ways evenly, as I explained. I’m unclear on how that may look in terms of what happens to our house. I should note that, my Dad did the same deal with my brother and his wife with the 20% downpayment loan for a similar house value, but is a guarantor on the note. He also helped our youngest brother with a loan for 10 acres. So, we would kind of be in the same boat if we DO get the loan, and would forgive any debts outstanding to my Dad between any of us and split the rest. If we DON’T get the loan, what happens? One of my brothers is in sales with a wife getting her doctorate with grant money and no job, so with his job security up in the air, they would have almost no income. The other is a marine combat veteran, so he’ll still get his disability paychecks monthly. Right now, he lives with my Dad so he can pay the note on his land, but wouldn’t be able to afford to pay his land note and rent somewhere if things changed. Their properties wouldn’t be considered in the inheritance equation, and we would have to buy out their shares of our/technically my Dad’s house? How does this kind of thing work? What’s the worst case scenario for this? 

4. Finally, besides his homestead that has outrageous property taxes, and our house, my Dad owns 5 other rental properties. Worst case scenario in play, what would happen if those tenants can’t pay their rent during this economic crisis? Our city has literally said they will not evict tenants during Coronavirus. What does that mean for my brothers and I, if we inherit properties and are unable to evict tenants that can’t pay and we are unable to sell? Will they get foreclosed on in our name? This is insane to think about. Also, this could happen to my Dad as it stands now. 

5. Last, my Dad also told me today that he lost $114k in the stock market on Thursday and got $90k back on Friday. I’m not sure if he even has anything in savings bc it doesn’t earn as much interest. Once again, worst case scenario, if he loses his entire life savings including his 401k, maxes out his credit and can’t pay for his cobra and loses coverage, doesn’t qualify for Medicare and can’t afford treatments or to cover his rental property payments that his tenants can’t pay, what happens then? Worried sick over this. How would it play out with inheriting medical and credit card debt from a parent? 


Thanks for listening to my rant. I’m hoping to get some real advice on this. Didn’t think I’d be asking any of these questions a few weeks ago. Also, any recommendations on good credit cards that would get approval with my score of 710. Like I said before, we have been building our credit for a few years, so I only have 1 card with a small limit.",finance

The growing overleveraged debt ridden companies are caused by malinvestment due to low interest rates. The federal reserve has proven that it would rather let inflation run rampant, instead of letting the stock market fall. 
Fed just announced their 1.5 trillion asset repurchase program, but nothing to be surprised about it’s going much higher than this. The federal reserve is trillions into QE4, and will bring rates to 0. Let the gov tank the dollar with its endless spending and own gold.

personalfinance,Borrow extra in home refinance to buy the stock dip?,"I'm refinancing my house with an interest rate of 2.375%. We haven't gone to closing yet, so it occurred to me to ask the loan guy if it's possible to borrow an additional amount up to the value of the house. He said yes, and sent me the numbers to compare.

Over the 15 years I will pay it back, if I go with the ""extra money"" option, I will pay $9,000 more in in interest. My mortgage will also go up a couple hundred per month (which I can afford). But I will get an extra $26,000 of cash to play with.

I plugged my $26,000 in to [this stock market calculator](https://www.calculator.net/investment-calculator.html?ctype=endamount&amp;ctargetamountv=1000000&amp;cstartingprinciplev=26000&amp;cyearsv=15&amp;cinterestratev=10&amp;ccontributeamountv=0&amp;ciadditionat1=annually&amp;printit=0&amp;x=82&amp;y=29) and used a 10% return for the stock market. It says I end up with $108,000 after 15 years.

My math says that I gain $108,000 - $26,000 - $9,000 = $73,000.

Am I missing anything here? It seems like a no-brainer to borrow the extra money. I know it's often advised not to do this sort of thing due to risk, but I feel that the market is low right now and so it's an extremely ""safe"" time to buy in.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: I realized that a more accurate comparison is to use a [stock market calculation where I start with $0 invested and contribute $200 a month](https://www.calculator.net/investment-calculator.html?ctype=endamount&amp;ctargetamountv=1000000&amp;cstartingprinciplev=0&amp;cyearsv=15&amp;cinterestratev=10&amp;ccontributeamountv=200&amp;ciadditionat1=monthly&amp;printit=0&amp;x=75&amp;y=31) (the difference between the potential monthly mortgage payments). Here I end up with almost $80,000 after 15 years.

So now the math is $108,000 - $80,000 - $9,000 = $19,000. Not enormous, but still pretty decent.",finance

personalfinance,Buy close to work or further,"Okay, so my wife and I (and baby and 2 dogs) are currently in the market for a new home and we’ve narrowed it down to two houses.  As a preface my income is about 75k a year (varies because of overtime).  She’s a stay at home mom for now.  We have 60k to put toward the new home.  When we sell our current home we will be receiving about 40-45k of equity from the sale which we plan on paying off her student loans which is 25k.  We also have a car loan of 15k which we may partially pay off too.  With our credit we qualify for the best interest rates which as of a few days ago I was told were 2.875.  

Both homes are 210k.  The first one is 6 miles from my work and has a wonderful property.  3 acres, big detached two car garage and barn.  The house itself is nice, albeit a bit dated (was built in the 80s and has a lot of that tacky 80s feel, so is the garage and barn).  Propane heated with supplemental wood stove.  Overall it’s a nice home though.  The second house is about 25 miles from my work (we also live in the upper peninsula of Michigan so the winters are brutal and the commute can be rough in the winter).  The house is in my opinion a lot nicer and much more updated.  Natural gas with brand new furnace and AC.  Also supplemental wood stove.  It sits on a river and has a detached two car garage, a barn, and a big shed, all new.  It sits on just shy of an acre.  Either would be great for the dogs.

Overall I like the second home better but the allure of the commute from the first one is very tempting.  My wife likes both but prefers the first one because she’s nervous about our little one and the river.  The one closer to work is also bigger.  Financially I’d probably be better off with the one closer to work, but I feel like the second home is nicer and better value(or at least feels like it).  Having a hard time making a decision.  Any input from a financial stand point and experience standpoint would be great.  Thanks

personalfinance,Second job tax implications?,"Hello,

Throwaway because I post a lot about my profession. 

I make a little more than 65k a year. I contribute 12.6% to my retirement (100% company match), and it's mandatory to contribute. 

I'm trying to pay my car off as quickly as possible and am already on track to pay it off in six months (one year early). I currently owe 6.5k on it and pay $500 every two weeks towards it. The interest rate is ridiculous, which is why it's not paid off already. 

I have three day weekend every weekend and am thinking about picking up a second job in retail for a few months to pay the car off quicker. Minimum wage is $12/hr here and I'd work no more than 16-20 hours a week. 

My question is, how much would this amount at a second job affect my taxes at the end of the year? I'm trying to decide if it's worth it to do this.

Bitcoin,Some Sunday Solidarity.,"The most common cause of bank failure occurs when the value of the bank's assets falls below the market value of the bank's liabilities, which are the bank's obligations to creditors and depositors. This might happen because the bank loses too much on its investments.

What happens in a world where all banks are forced by regulations to hold government debt as a form of excess reserves and the worlds largest bond bubble bursts leaving their assets worth less than their liabilities, while at the same time the bond market collapse causes interest rates to spike not just in repo markets but across the wider economy affecting the value of their mortgage books.

Credit markets freeze, withdrawals stop being processed,  ATMs stop functioning, wire transfers fail, banks get bailed-out and then bailed-in, business operational credit flows dry up. Entire economies stop lending to each other and the banking system freezes up.

I've done the math and I should be able to comfortably pay off my 30 year loan in 10 years, so I debate the value of a refinance due to the closing costs (2-5% it seems like based on where I do the refinance).

I’m currently using the debt avalanche to tackle them, and I’m way ahead on the payments (if I only make the minimum payment plus my company’s monthly contribution, they’ll be gone &lt; 5 years). Being ahead is mostly due to signing bonus, relocation lump sump, and tax return, not monthly income, although I pay extra when I can. I’m currently contributing 8% (minimum contribution to get full company match) into a Roth 401(k) and saving $500/month for a 3 month emergency fund. I also put $250/month into a brokerage account.

I’ve been considering taking the Dave Ramsey approach and pulling out of my 401(k) and stopping my emergency savings and just annihilating those student loans in about a year. I wanted to ask: would that be a good idea? Obviously, I’m very lucky to be where I’m at and I’m by no means in a dire financial mess, which is what is holding me back from relentlessly attacking the debt. Also, the sooner the student loans are gone, the more money that’s left on the table from my company since they contribute $100/month, up to $9,000, which would take 7 years (this is kind of a weak argument, but I still think about it).

Edit: weighted average interest rate on the student loans is 4.61%. All federal. I pay just under $100 in interest per month, which is essentially covered by the company contribution.",finance

personalfinance,I do not quite understand how bonds work in an asset/retirement asset. As well as the relationship between their yield and the market.,"I was wondering if i can get help understanding how bonds work exactly.

the things i do understand are

1. there are bonds, but there are also bills and notes. only difference is the length of the timeframe.. bills being shortest, bonds being the longest.

2. bonds (and bills/notes) are debt sold by the government. Basically a loan. you give them $x and they pay you principal/interest. kinda like how a mortgage or a standard loan works.

so with this in mind, how does one buy bonds for their retirement fund and/or general investment?

also, how is this all allocated in an asset as well as withdrawn from your account? i.e. an IRA fund for someone in retirement fund has, lets say, 90% bond and 10% still in stocks. they withdraw yearly to keep that 9:1 allocation. withdrawing from their stocks asset is simple. because theres no things like length of the ""loan"", interest paid to you, etc. with bonds, i dont quite get how this works.

Hey guys so i had a question hopefully your responses will get me a better understanding of how refinancing works. 

Ive been looking for a loan calculator and havent found one that tells me my interest rate that i’m paying but i have a small clue. (Besides the paperwork thats given and checking my accounts on a weekly basis to see how much interest i am paying)

I’m just looking to find places or ask the current loan owners if there is a possibility of lower interest rates on my loan for instance my toolbox or my car.

My toolbox interest rate is ridicolous and i am not sure on how to approach a payoff from another bank in hoping to gain a lower interest rate (but i was told i needed something that a bank can hold until my loan is paid off) which i am ok with cause all i really have is my other car note.

4500 and interest rate is added on my account every beginning of the month (snap on interest rate is 15%!!!) 

The second one was my car loan. Interest on a car is $100 a month but principle is $300 which sounds normal but i might see if another bank is willing to take the loan with a lower interest rate but same payments.

Bitcoin,Bitcoin and cryptocurrency trading strategy in a panic on the coronavirus.,"The upcoming problems with banks and the Fed’s money printing are excellent opportunities for cryptocurrencies and blockchain projects. Incredible events are taking place in the stock market, the fastest falling markets in history, the spread of coronavirus in the United States and the likely risk of falling consumer demand, lower consumption and, as a result, recession.

Analysis in such conditions becomes impossible, the position of traders is removed from the market. The Fed’s cash infusion is $ 1.5 trillion per month and the base rate is reduced, as a result, money is poured into the market in order to stop the market from falling, but this may not be enough.

# Oil war

In addition, a trade oil war was added to the coronavirus, and this could cause serious problems for US shale oil companies, whose production costs are $ 30–40. The US oil sector is sitting on a wild leverage, and as a result, banks that lend to them can start problems. Thus, is it possible to say that this is perhaps the best moment for cryptocurrency projects that can be competitive in comparison with the banking sector? Well, we still have to find out.

# The fall of Bitcoin and the entire cryptocurrency market

Bitcoin’s collapse was stronger than the stock market for several reasons. Well, firstly, the correlation between the S&amp;P 500 index and Bitcoin reached 1. If earlier Bitcoin was associated as a protective asset and did not have a pronounced correlation, now all markets have started to fall during a mass panic. By the way, you can [check the correlation of your crypto portfolio for free at Holderlab.io](https://holderlab.io/)

# The search for liquidity as the beginning of accelerating the fall of cryptocurrencies

The reasons for the strong current decline in the cryptocurrency market may be due to the fact that stock market traders were looking for liquidity in order to maintain margin requirements. In this case, liquidity was sought in risky assets, those Bitcoins and cryptocurrencies, perhaps some traders went completely into the dollar. This is where the first wave of decline in the cryptocurrency market began.

## Bitmex Margin Trading

The incoming wave from the reduction of positions in Bitcoin from stock market traders has demolished the position of margin traders on Bitmex. As a result, $ 500 million in long positions were liquidated in an hour, and it remains to be seen how many were liquidated for other trading pairs.

&amp;#x200B;

[BitMEX XBTUSD Liquidations data from skew.com](https://preview.redd.it/3jy659f4vum41.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=16969cfcf85a834a6bb6f1e6331a79bb41c721b7)

As a result, we saw a drop up to $ 3800. A great lesson for those who trade with leverage.

Another curious fact is that cryptocurrency exchanges do not have mechanisms to stop trading, as we saw in the stock markets when there was a limit down on S&amp;P500.

## Trading Bitcoin Futures on CME

In anticipation of the elimination of margin positions on Bitmex and other crypto exchanges. Starting February 25, there was an active closing of long positions in Bitcoin futures and opening short positions on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Which also influenced the fall of bitcoin as a whole. Cryptocurrency exchange margin traders have become a blast wave for the fall of Bitcoin.

# Cryptocurrency trading strategy in a panic situation

Already today cryptocurrencies are sold at a significant discount, but now we are forced to monitor the dynamics of the S &amp; P500 index and the general news background, which can affect the price of Bitcoin. However, in our opinion, the best moment for the Bitcoin HODL is probably coming. Today we see a good discount before the upcoming halving.

Do not expect the best price, it is almost impossible to catch, if it is possible to place pending orders this is good, today you can slowly buy current prices.

Anyone sitting in an equities/bond allocated portfolio last week was hammered hard.  Any money sitting in treasuries or bonds would have been far better off in cash . . . cash that can be used to average down equities positions at some point.

But Mr. FeralPygmy you say the Fed is going to cut rates and our treasury bond positions shall prosper soon, right?

[https://www.investopedia.com/articles/03/122203.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/03/122203.asp)

If the Federal Reserve enacts stimulus plans in addition to rate cuts, yields on US treasuries can rise which will reduce the price of treasuries (i.e., your treasury/bond fund in your 401k will lose value):

investing,"[Bloomberg] Fed May Target Commercial Paper Purchases, BofA Says","&gt;The Federal Reserve may take steps to ease strains in the commercial paper market, a source of short-term funds for companies that has frozen up amid the global market rout, according to Bank of America Corp. strategists.

&gt;The central bank could announce facilities to buy commercial paper Sunday evening, strategists Mark Cabana and Olivia Lima said in a note dated March 13. Without Fed intervention, spiraling costs of the short-term IOUs could pressure bank balance sheets and cause a run on money-market funds that hold the debt, they said.

&gt;“If the Fed waits too long,” the strategists wrote, outflows from money-market funds could mount “and the risk of a large scale MMF run could increase.”

&gt;The launch of a special lending facility would require the Fed to consult with the Treasury Secretary and to give Congress details on borrowers, amounts and collateral, according to laws put in place under the 2010 Dodd Frank Act. The laws also prohibit the Fed from using such a facility to help a single company or a company that is insolvent.

&gt;Federal Reserve spokeswoman Michelle Smith declined to comment.

&gt;Companies sell commercial paper to fund everyday activities such as rent and salaries. The market came under stress in recent days as the coronavirus pandemic crimps corporate revenues and prompts businesses to shore up cash.



&gt;That dash for cash caused relative yields on commercial paper to surge last week, with rates on three-month paper for non-financial companies reaching the highest level since the financial crisis relative to a funding benchmark known as overnight indexed swaps.

&gt;CP spreads have soared amid global market rout
Money-market funds are also selling commercial paper in order to raise cash in anticipation of investor withdrawals, according to the Bank of America strategists.

&gt;If the Fed takes action, it would likely create two facilities that would buy commercial paper directly from issuers as well as purchase the debt that’s stuck on dealer balance sheets, the strategists wrote. The first facility would be similar to one created during the 2008 financial crisis, which allowed companies to continue funding themselves through the market stress, they said.

I think this is going to be very (good?) news for the financial markets knowing that even with small businesses or retail investors flocking to cash, the Fed will basically be making sure the credit markets stay liquid and afloat.

This matched with the Fiscal stimulus that we are seeing is really going to boom things into the second half of 2020.",finance

Student Loans (Gov't): $29.7K including:

I'm still wondering if we should try to refinance our loans to get a lower interest rate, but I've heard we shouldn't do that because they're gov't loans. One other plus is that since my husband is in grad school, we're able to throw his $450 directly at his 6.8% loans without having a minimum payment on the other loans.) Should we still consider refi'ing?

We both put 12% in our 401Ks which we are planning to decrease soon. We realize our emergency fund is low, but we've been targeting our student loan debt and paying my husband's grad school tuition each semester to avoid taking out grad school loans.

(Separately, we are planning to purchase our first home in two years so we'd ideally like to start saving for a ~$30K down payment.)

One other thing I have to think about is where to roll over my current $25K 401K. My new employer doesn't match (so unfortunate); they offer either 401K or Roth 401K with potential profit sharing at the end of the year, but that's not guaranteed. My bank (Chase) suggested I roll it into a Traditional IRA with them, but my husband is thinking it's better to roll it over to my employer since they will likely cover more fees than if I were to move it to Chase. Is this generally the recommendation?

Does this plan sound good? Please let me know if there are any other things to keep in mind! Thanks in advance!",finance

Banking,"For those working in the field, what is your FI doing during the Coronavirus outbreak?","The FI I work for announced Friday that they had finalizing their plans related to the Coronavirus outbreak. It sounds like they are mainly monitoring school closures as many employees have school-aged children and would not be able to come to work if their children were kept home. We should be receiving communications today letting us know if the plans will go into effect for tomorrow.

The plan would basically consist of the Branches going to drive-through transactions only and being staffed by 2 or 3 people. The corporate offices (where I work) would require non-essential employees and anyone with a higher likelihood of exposure to stay home. A core group of essential staff would work from home as much as possible and some would remain on staff in the corporate offices. Our call center, accounting, management, and IS teams would mainly be considered the core group. During the reduction, we would focus pretty much entirely or assisting existing customers only.

I kind of hope it doesn't come to this, but I also live with my elderly parents and I want to minimize their exposure as much as possible.

I'm curious if your FI has also put together or has already implemented a plan, and what their plan looks like.

Update: My department manager texted us to say that we should all come in per usual on Monday. There was supposedly a big meeting with management and there would be updates afterwards. The updates were pretty much the same as the Friday before. Nothing really new. They are hoping to have as many people set up to work from home as possible by Thursday, but I couldn't get a clear timeline on when, or if, that would be true for me. I'm actually scheduled to help out in one of the branches this week (something that was already planned before the outbreak got worse and everything started closing). With my parents being over 65, I'm trying to limit my exposure, and in turn their exposure, as much as possible. I asked both my manager and the manager of the branch about the current plans in the branches in regard to closing the lobbies and going to drive-though transactions only. Neither of them had a solid timeline on when, or even if, that was going to happen. The mayor of our city has asked that all restaurants and bars close except for curbside or delivery services. I'm frustrated that my FI hasn't taken the initiative to close it's lobbies. It seems like the right thing to do. Most transactions can be done through the drive though with ease. Let's be honest, MOST transactions can be done online or through an ATM. My feeling is they are worried about optics. I'm sure they will close the lobbies eventually, but I think they are delaying it as long as possible, and that is just stupid.",finance

personalfinance,A question about taxable scholarships and tax returns,"TL;DR - Is a scholarship taxable because it could potentially have been allocated to cover 'non-essential' costs, or because it did?

I'm trying to figure out whether or not I need to fill out form 8615 or not. I fit every criteria to do so except for one that I'm not sure about. You have to make over $2,200 in unearned income to fill it. Taxable scholarships are considered unearned income, so I looked to see what made them taxable, and apparently if they are if they cover room and board, or other things not essential to graduating.

What I'm trying to figure out now is whether the scholarship is taxable because it *could have* covered room and board, or if it *did.* I received a $3,000 federal pell grant this year, which can cover both tuition and room and board.  I also have a partial scholarship that covers my tuition expenses, plus an untaxable grant check from the VA that would cover everything else and leave me with $1,000 something in the bank to use for books and stuff. This means that the federal pell grant was used somewhere, but I don't know where.",finance

personalfinance,"Parents used home equity loan to consolidate my student loans (been paying them), but now want me to take it back over. What are my options?","I had multiple federal student loans and my parents had a parents PLUS loan to pay for school. About 4 years ago they took out a home equity loan to consolidate with a better interest rate (4.99% APR). They're looking too retire soon and I guess it's no longer the best option for them. I have no problem taking it over, but I'm looking for my best option. The remaining balance is 56k. I have fairly good credit (700+), but I don't know what type of loan I can take out to pay them back, since it's technically not student debt anymore. It seems like personal loans have pretty high interest rates. I can afford about $600-$700 a month. Any advice?",finance
personalfinance,My IRA money is currently sitting in Vanguard's Federal Money Market Fund,"After I did my taxes I did some research on this sub and decided to open a Vanguard account.  I transferred over 6k from 2019 and 6k for 2020 (legal maximum?).  Since the stock market has been volatile I have been hesitant to move that money into VTSAX quite yet.

A few questions:

1. Can I move my money out of Vanguard back into my Ally savings account? If so, will there be a point where I am no longer legally able to put the 6k from 2019 back into my IRA?

2. I have a strong feeling the economy will get worse considering what is going on.  I am not touching any of my money that is already invested, but since my this IRA money is not yet invested, I am considering waiting it out for a bit.  I know it's taking advantage of a shitty situation, but I could potentially buy more VTSAX shares if I wait. Is this advised?

3. Is there a limit to how long I can wait before allocating this money out of the money market?

personalfinance,What would a 0% interest rate really mean?,"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/13/fed-increasingly-expected-to-cut-interest-rates-to-zero-next-week.html

I’m curious what this would mean for the everyday person.  What could we realistically expect to be able to borrow money for if the feds are lending at 0%?  I feel like it would be worth it to refinance my home.  The last time we did that was 2017 and our credit has increase significantly since then.  Thoughts?

Edit: Surprisingly this thread has blown up over night- thank you for all of the informative post.
Some of the recurring answers to common questions, including my own relating to refinancing my mortgage , is that the drop to 0% doesn’t mean that people like me will be able to borrow/refinance from banks and lenders interest free(some exceptions may apply to car loans).  Prime rate is not directly tied to the Fed rate, though it does often change when the Fed rate does.  Prime rate usually adds 3 percentage points to the fed rate.  For example my current 30 yr mortgage is 3.875% and we refinanced in 2017, so even though we have excellent credit and very low DTI, the rate drop may not offer us significantly better rates.  Please feel free to correct me if this information is incorrect.",finance

personalfinance,"Low Mortgage Rates Vs Low Inventory, First Time Buyer","I've been dreaming about becoming a first-time home buyer. I have been aggressively saving for a 20% down payment (to avoid PMI) for a few years. Luckily, my rent isn't outrageous (although it has been raised 5 times in the last 2 years) so I'm able to continue to save until I'm ready, most likely in October. I have a number of my coworkers that are either refinancing, or have appointments to try and get pre-approved to lock into the low coronavirus rates.
 
I live in an area that has seen a near DOUBLING in home prices over the past couple of years due to tech companies moving in and bay area refugees moving from California. As a result of both, inventory is at near record lows.
 
Is there any point in locking in a low rate on a pre-approved mortgage before I reach my 20% goal if there isn't any inventory?
 
It's my understanding that you can pay to lock in for as much as 60 days.  Also, with a rush of people getting pre-approved, doesn't that mean there's going to be an even worst inventory situation coming soon? Will we see a huge increase in prices beyond what they are now? Will the lower interest rates really offset an inflated house price in the long term?",finance

Understand that you’re not the only person to think this, and there’s going to be a huge amount of people trying to do the same, so while the fed just cut interest rates, individual lenders are likely to keep them roughly where they are (or lower obviously since no one except them knows exactly what their limits look like) so they can actually meet the demand of all the people trying to do exactly what you’re doing.

personalfinance,HELP- Fed Cut Loan Rate to 0%- What do I do?,"Hello everyone!!

Recently, the US Federal Reserve cut interest rates to 0%. I am currently in a heap of student loan debt (around $75,000) paying a 5.875% interest rate between both Direct Sub and Unsub Consolidated Loans through My Fed Loans. I had originally applied and was accepted under the Loan Forgiveness Program with them. However, given the fact they are not repaying to many (and I am leaving teaching), I need to find another way to pay these down.

I have no idea how any of this works. (My parents were not great financial planners and I cannot ask them) How can I use this to my advantage to refinance the loans with 0% interest so I am actually paying them down, rather than a $550.00 payment that just covers interest monthly?

Can anyone help explain this to me or what to do? I want to get out from under this! I hope I gave all the info you needed to help!",finance

economy,Does fed cutting rates really make a difference to the interest rate on Loans?,"I recently refinanced my home and I was talking to the Mortgage officer on how much lower the interest rate could be after the fed cut the rate by 50 basis points. To my surprise, the answer was that the rates actually went up for people that want to finance or refinance a home loan.  Here is what she said to me.

&amp;#x200B;

This is a 30 day snapshot of rates. It is inverted that means the higher the FNMA 30-YR = lower rates. Red is bad meaning it opened up higher (lower rate) and closed lower (higher rate) in that specific day which means rates went up. The bottom line is this is typically what we follow and affects our rates daily. On top of this what is not factored here is capacity levels and volatility in the market. With capacities being maxed, lenders price up rates to slow the volume of applications as they can only handle certain amount of loans at a time no matter what the cost is for the rate. Volatility means that lenders get paid if the loan stays on their books for awhile and if sold off, then the lender loses money on the back end. Volatility in the market or extreme change the lenders add a margin on top of the cost of the money since they are getting killed in servicing and don’t know when it will stabilize. Its very very confusing but I can only tell you that leading up to the best cost on money, banks were kind of factoring in on their rates and with the fed cut last Tuesday, the market went haywire with volumes, capacities and volatility so rates began to price up higher each day starting last Tuesday and then the actual market and cost of money sky rocketed yesterday and today again. I believe things will settle down into a pattern again and banks like patterns because they can begin predicting again which will lower that margin back down. You can see last week we hit 103.5 for a few minutes or hours of that day but the market closed at 102.19 today so that equates to a differential of 1.31 so I have never seen such huge spreads and remember the lower the 30 year bond, the higher the rate is going up. For every .25 it equals about .125% higher rate so you can see that rates just under that portion would be almost .625% higher than 1 week plus ago just on cost. That does not factor in the margins and capacity issues that I referred to. It will take awhile for the market to settle down and rates to begin falling back down again but we are much higher than we were a few weeks or a month ago for sure.

&amp;#x200B;

So the customer-facing banks essentially just keep the interest rates unchanged even charge higher for a while on the long term loans, even after the fed cuts the rate.

investing,Liquidity issues in the MBS and Treasury Markets,"During today's Fed call, they made a very important statement. This statement was that ""There have been liquidity issues in the MBS and Treasury markets.""

They further went on to explain ""Even during the Repo operations, we were not seeing the liquidity that we needed, and this is what spurred us to take action.""

This is a problem. The Treasury market is generally pretty useful for helping companies make payroll, help peg mortgage rates, and basically be a store of value.

When no one is buying treasuries, people start pulling cash out of the markets, and equities are instead sold instead of the treasuries. This leads to a decrease in price of equities, which is what we are seeing. This is why the fed has lowered the reserve requirements to 0 for the banks, and they have stopped doing share buybacks, because we need this stuff to continue churning along.

The second part of this is MBS liquidity issues and in my opinion, is the smaller issue. If any of you tried to refinance last week, you would know that you are not getting quoted lower rates. This is because no one is buying MBSes. This caused interest rates to spike to over 4%, which is a problem for anyone wanting to buy a house. The reason the fed is buying them up is to lower rates for mortgages.

\*\*So what does this all mean?\*\*

The fed, contrary to popular belief, is not trying to prop up the stock market. The fed is trying to propup the actual economy at this point with their actions. This isn't necessarily a problem, however the issue is that if this continues, the Fed will run out of ammo, or worse, no one but the Fed is putting money into the system. This creates a cyclical effect where everyone is trying to get out at the same time, and you get crashes.

Bitcoin,"Still storing your value for the moment it promised it would, 11 years later.","I think people who say the recent market crash proves that Bitcoin's use case as a Store of Value are missing the point.  BTC was never intended to be a panacea that would protect it's holders from every possible type of market downturn.  Rather, the ""Store of Value"" narrative speaks towards Bitcoin's resilience against a very specific type of economic crisis, namely the collapse of the fractional reserve banking system, and the resulting carnage.  While we very well may look back at last week as the straw that broke the camels back and made said collapse inevitable, we still have a long way to go before we get to the point where Bitcoin's strength as a store of value will shine.  The Fed still has a little ammunition left, and they are going to pull out all the stops to do whatever they can to keep their house of cards from crumbling down around them.  I expect Bitcoin to go down more - a lot more - before it goes up again.  I also think that it's more likely than not that we will come out of this with the credit system intact...the printing press is powerful, and people have believed in the ""Full faith and credit of the US Government"" as a 100% guarantee for, well, generations now.

I have been working as an Engineer in the DC-VA-MD (NOVA) area, and recently started a job with the federal government.  I am considering purchasing my first home (a condo) in Virginia in the next 3 months. Here is some information about me:

Job Salary: 92,000 

Savings: 37,000

401k (soon to be TSP): 32,000

I understand that a 401k/TSP account can be used towards the purchase of a down payment, with the repayment being directly deposited in the 401k and you only have to pay tax back on the interest payments which also end up being invested back into the account? Is taking out a loan against your 401k ill advised? I see mixed reviews about this from my research, and I understand with the market volatility it is probably an even worse an idea now.

So, will all of this information I was hoping to get some outside perspective on my options here, all condos/houses in the seem to be anywhere from 350k-600k. This is a huge range I realize, but unfortunately this is what it costs to buy around here. I will be living with my GF who intends to help with monthly payments, and I would prefer to at least spring for a 2br or a 1br + den so I am likely looking at a place that costs \~450k.

I am in the early stages of research, and really have no idea what I am doing. I know most people suggest putting 20% down, but honestly with how much houses cost here, I realistically do not see how that would be possible any time soon. I have been employed for 5 years making decent money, but my student loans put me 100k behind most of my peers. Luckily I finished paying them off last year, so I should be seeing decent gains in my savings in the coming years.

Given my current finances, I am really looking for some realistic advice on purchasing a place of my own. If I am able to put together a decent down payment, say  \~10%, am I really making a bad decision? 

Any help or advice on my current finances would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.",finance

Crazy timing. We are finally closing on our house on Thursday.   I’m going to PNC to take out a cashier’s check for about 38k for our 20% and closing costs.  Suddenly after reading the new stuff with the Fed today (sorry for the wrong terminology, I’m new to this) I’m nervous because it’s weird timing and we don’t totally know what we’re doing.  We are buying our house directly from our landlord (we rented this house for 5 years and love it) so we have no realtor. 

Our interest rate is about 3.5 and our apr is 3.75 for a 30 year loan.  Borrowing about $116k. We settled on this two weeks ago. Is that still ok? 

The FDIC should protect our ability to take out the cashiers check right?  

We still have an emergency fund and savings so this check isn’t clearing us out.

personalfinance,I'm trying to build credit in college,"Hey guys, I'm trying to build my credit up. I don't know why but I think it's a good idea because a lot of people tell me to do so (I know—shitty reason). In all honesty, because I'm not a business major, I just want to dip my toes in the real world and come out of college with at least a small understanding of personal finance.

Anyways,

I have a couple loans open. One is a private loan to help pay off my first year in college. I pay for this each month because it's not too steep. My parents help pay for the rest of tuition. I'm currently a sophomore and started dorming this year. My parents decided to pay for the bulk of it this time. The other loans are federal loans I really won't be touching until I get my job. I personally do not have enough money to try and even chip a dent into paying these off. I don't know if it would help my credit if I start doing monthly payments for these.

This past month alone, I was able to open up both an Apple Card and a Capital One Platinum Card. I don't think they're that special, and I do know most people despise the Apple Card for the low benefits. I'm probably going to use the Apple Card as much as I can if Apple Pay is applicable and the Capital One card whenever I can't (most likely) to raise my limit.

I know opening accounts or more credit cards would lower my overall credit score. I'm trying to open up a few savings accounts with promotion bonuses. Would these lower my credit score? The Capital One credit score app tells me opening numerous accounts would lower my credit. I don't know if that applies with savings accounts.

I'll have a talk with my parents tomorrow if I can be added as a user for their cards. Unfortunately, we did buy a new house recently so I don't know if my parent's currently ""lower-than-usual"" credit would affect my credit negatively if I were added as an authorized user for their credit cards.

Right now I believe I have a low score of 626. If I can raise that ever so slightly per month I would be happy. Are there any other methods of raising my credit beside proactively using and paying for my cards? Would it only affect my score if I get a raise in credit limits?

As always, thanks guys!",finance

Bitcoin,"Gemini co-founder: Fed lowers base interest rate to zero, bitcoin is best hedge tool","Tyler Winklevoss, co-founder of cryptocurrency exchange Gemini, said today that the Federal Reserve has reduced the base interest rate to zero. Twitter commented that Bitcoin is the best hedging tool in the world for this. Bitcoin is not a hedge against the epidemic, but a hedge against the fiat currency regime. A sudden negative demand shock in the global economy will affect all assets, including gold, in the short term. The world will pass this level, and Bitcoin has the toughness and endurance to continue in the game.

Now, there’s a glimmer of light that makes me believe the value of houses will go down and I want to jump on it. I have enough for 20% down for a good home but will probably go with a 3% first time home buyers program. I have job security. 

Should I start talking to a real estate agent? 
Should I get pre-approved?
What should I do?

Edit: im only looking to buy if house prices go down. Yeah low interest rates are nice but I’d rather buy at a lower price and refinance later.

personalfinance,Is now a bad time to buy a car?,"As I'm typing this the Gov of Massachusetts has just banned all restaurants and bars from serving people in house, only takeout purchases allowed. My girlfriend is a bar tender who is now presumably not working for the next month (3/17-4/17).

I sold my car two weeks ago before the virus had really started to get bad in our area.  The repairs were approximately 4x the value of the car.  I've been car shopping while this virus and public panic has been spreading and I'm beginning to worry financially. 

I have limited debt (~5,000 in student loans) and that's about it.  She has significantly more but not an unmanageable amount of debt. We've been working to fix our financial situation and we're both doing a good job.

But would it be unwise of me to go finance a car right now. With the Feds slashing the interest rates I'm scared of accruing more debt and leaving myself vulnerable. I have probably around 10k cash in savings and a high paying job that is in critical infrastructure / utility.  Should I wait until this virus and economic situation pans out more?  

We are currently sharing her vehicle which has been difficult since we both need a car for work, but now with bars being closed for a month we may have more flexibility.

stocks,Another Red Monday,"In my Friday’s recap I wrote about how Monday will have a huge decline and it turns out it is correct. I point out this because it is the underlining problem of this decline – the computer trading.
On Friday, in the last 30minutes the market regained more than 6%. This is unbelievable, totally not fundamental and illogical. Why would the market go up on a Friday, when you have so much uncertainty coming into the weekend and not knowing what will happen. A lot of this move was short seller covering their short positions, but even this is mostly automated and the computers trade on a second by second bases and when their running averages are being hit, they just keep on adding to the move. It is the same in this morning’s sell-off. The futures are down 5% at the limit, but the ETF’s are showing an open around 9 to 10% down.
If we look at the European markets, they are down from 7 to 10% on the day, and if we add to the fact that on Friday they did not get the bump the US market got, they are in a worse position. This is reflective in the real world as well, where Europe is much more isolated and taking bigger and broader measures then the US, but I am afraid that these measures will come to the US and that will take down the US market even more.
It is important to note that the Asian markets are coping better with this crises, with their markets only down 3 to 4%.
Yesterday the Fed cut interest rates down to 0%, first time since the 2008 crises and announced many other measures to keep the financial system stable. And to their credit they are doing everything they can and more than necessary in my opinion.
I do not believe cutting the rates was necessary since we are not coping with a financial crises. This is a pandemic, it can be resolved with a month of strict quarantine rules and everything will go back to the way it was. There is no stress on the financial sector and the only reason the Fed is doing this is to prop up the stock market, but what they do not understand is the decline in the market has nothing to do with the fundamentals. That is why I brought up the computer trading. I have been a strong advocate for selling during this entire crises and still am, not because I think the economy will never recover, or that this is an end of the world situation. I recommend selling because I follow the markets closely and I see the reactions it is having on the news cycle. Because of the automated trading the selling is over-pronounced and the markets are decking sharply.

Today will be another very bad day, with a stop of trading probably after the open. Last week both times that we saw the circuit breaker pause the markets for 15 minutes, we saw another decline in the next couple of minutes after it resumed and then from that bottom a sharp upward move. In both instances the markets recovered more than 3, 4% after the break and then during the trading period lost the gains again. Keep this in mind if you are day-trading. There is still bad news coming and stricter measures will be taken to fight the outbreak, so we will continue to decline. Still NOT a buying opportunity.
Good luck!",finance
personalfinance,Should I sell my car and take out a personal loan to payoff CC and student debt?,"This is a 2 part question and I just dont know what is the best thing to do to climb out of this hole. Im a total noob when it comes to this stuff so please bear with me.

1. I have approximately $8000 cc debt and $3500 student debt, about $11,500. Monthly payments for all come out to over $200, which im sure is a ton of interest. Is it a smart idea to say, go down to my bank and get a personal loan to pay off these debts, then continue to make payments to the bank with a lower interest rate? Are there any risks involved in doing something like this?

2. A year ago I bought a new car. At the time i desperately needed transportation to work and school, and my previous car was done so it made sense. I got a decent deal that i was happy with and would still be happy with if not for one thing: after i finished school, i got a new job and a company vehicle. My new car is sitting in the parking lot collecting dust and im paying $450 a month between the note and insurance. That $450 a month would go a long way to getting caught up financially, and i would sell the car if I could. But im still making payments on it and i owe about what its worth.  I just dont know how i would go about getting rid of the car without the title being free and clear.

personalfinance,Scheduled to close on Refinance on March 24th. Should this be delayed or cancelled?,"My wife an I purchased a modest home in January of 2019 with 20% Down at an Interest Rate of 4.875%. We are now set to close on our no-cash-out Refinance on March 24th which will bring our rate down to 3.375%.

With all of the economic craziness right now, I fell hesitant to do so, but I feel as though I will go ahead:

Points for:

1. Shaving off 1.5% of interest on a loan is always good
2. We were overpaying on our old loan, but at 3.375% there would be little reason to do so (bear market now, but the bull in the future will beat this rate).
3. This loan would lower our monthly payment (all in) from 11% of our gross income to 10% of our gross income.  This frees up more cash for any other needs.
4. Nothing about the reasoning behind this decision changed with the current economic climate.

Points against:

1. Interest rates on long term debt could potentially be lowered, though to what extent is unknown.
2. Refinancing moves our ""break-even point"" on the home back by 1 year from 5 to 6, which means we are less liquid in the short term.

I am strongly leaning towards going ahead with this, but just want to be certain we are not missing anything.",finance

investing,Options Basics: Introduction to Time and Discount Rates,"**Before you read:** This is part of an ongoing series on the basics of options trading and valuation, focusing on stock options. This is the third post in the series. You do not necessarily need to read the preceding posts for this one to make sense, but please conder reading them first if you are not familiar with the following:

* The concept of equity. This is covered in part one: [https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/fdx8tw/options\_basics\_what\_is\_equity\_and\_why\_should\_i/](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/fdx8tw/options_basics_what_is_equity_and_why_should_i/)
* The concept of puts and calls as options on underlying assets, and how an increase in the volatility of the underlying asset can increase the value of options. You should also know, on some level, what the following stand for as they relate to options valuation: S, K, and σ. All of these topics are covered in part two, which also introduces a highly simplified version of the binomial model: [https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/fggids/options\_basics\_intro\_to\_puts\_calls\_and\_the/](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/fggids/options_basics_intro_to_puts_calls_and_the/)

This post will introduce two new concepts and apply them to improve our simplified binomial model. These concepts are the passage of time and the existence of discount rates, particularly a theoretical rate called rf.

Just as a note, there are some math equations with a lot of variables in some parts of this post. If you aren’t a math person, just try to understand the intuition behind the concepts at first, then come back to it when you feel bold. If you focus on what is really going on, the math will seem easier. However, if you need a refresher on exponents, you may want to look them up first before continuing here.



**Important Terms for This Post** (for quick reference if you get a bit lost):

PV: Present value, or the value of something if received right now

FV: Future value, or the value of something if received at some specified future time

r: Discount rate; the rate used in conjunction with time to differentiate PV from FV

rf: The theoretical riskless rate, a rate at which borrowing and lending may occur without risk (pretty close to 0% as of writing). rf stands for “risk free.” it can also be written rrf, if you want to be old school.

Node: A possible point in time on the binomial model. Our current model has three nodes; one at purchase, one in the upstate (what happens if S increases), and one in the downstate (what happens in S decreases).

t: a period of time, often a unit of time. t can be expressed in years for example, in which case a time two years away from a time called t0 would be called t2. 

T: time to expiration. It’s ok to use some form of t when you could use T as long as you are clear about the time period you are referring to, but don’t use T unless you really mean T. An easy way to remember is that there are a bunch of little ts on the way to the big T.  



**Why Time Matters: Present versus Future Value**

A common schoolyard trick when I was little was to promise to give somebody something, and then later say, “Well, I promised to give it to you, but I never said *when*. I’ll give it to you… in a million years!” 

What fun! Apart from bamboozling people, this scheme highlights a key concept in investing; There is value in not having to wait for the things you want. In theory, **a payoff now is more desirable than the same payoff later, which implies the existence of what investors call “the time value of money.”** Simply put; if we are to receive money in the future, we may be willing to accept a little less money to get paid now, so we don’t have to wait a million years or however long we would have to otherwise. Conversely, if we have the opportunity to receive money immediately, we might be convinced to wait a while to get paid if it means we can receive more. In other words, **for any future payoff, there is an analogous immediate payoff.** We’ll call the value of a future payoff “future value” or, “FV.” We’ll call the analogous immediate payoff “present value” or “PV.” 

It follows that FV is greater than PV, but by how much? The typical way to think about how to calculate the difference between PV and FV is to consider the opportunity cost of waiting. If you received some money now, you could lend or otherwise invest that money to make more money over time. Just how much money you could make determines FV. 

Here’s an example: Let’s say that PV (value right now, at time 0 or t0) is $10, and you are certain you can turn $10 into $11 over the course of a year. In this case, you would be theoretically indifferent between collecting $10 now and collecting $11 in one year because either way you could choose to have $11 a year from now. Therefore the one year FV of $10 (FV at t1) is $11 in this scenario.What if we wanted to know the FV in two years? Well, assuming your ability to turn money into more money never changes, we can consider that $11 is 10% greater than $10, which implies you can grow your money by 10% per year. At the end of the first year (and therefore start of the second year), you will have $11, and that money will also grow by 10% during the second year. $11 \* (1+10%) = $12.1 so the two year FV of $10 is $12.1 (FV at t2 = $12.1). Notice that the money compounds based on a certain exponential growth rate, 10% in this case. In other words, each year, FV grows more and more in dollars, but it grows at the same rate so that mathematically (FV(tn) / FV(tn-1))  - 1) = 10%. This rate is called the **“discount rate” or, “r.”** Note that it’s “r,” not “R.” 

The relationship between PV, FV, r and time (t) can be described mathematically. FV = PV \* (1+r)^t. What this is saying is that to get to FV, you take PV and then you multiply it by 1+r so that you get a number that is r% more than PV, and then you multiply that number by 1+r. You keep doing that until you have multiplied something by 1+r t times. Similarly, PV = FV / (1+r)^t. The idea here is the same except you are going from FV to PV, so you divide instead of multiply. An easy way to remember is that FV &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt; PV, so it makes sense to divide to go from FV to PV and multiply to go from PV to FV. Finally, r = ((FV / PV) ^ (1/t))-1. We’ll use that one a bit less. All that’s doing is rearranging the other two formulas to get to r. If you are still having some trouble feel free to seek advice in the comments, DM me, or look for a tutorial on the time value of money. 

Let’s work through an example to put it all together. If PV is $100 and the discount rate is 6% compounded annually, what is FV five years out? Applying the formula, $100 \* 1.065 = $133.82 (rounded to the nearest penny). 

**Question 1**, a little tougher for those who would like more practice: If 2 year FV = $104.04 and PV = $100, what is rf. Assume annual compounding. 

One problem with this framework is that the appropriate discount rate may change over time. After all, even if you know you could turn $10 into $11 one year, how do we know you can do it again the next year or the year after that? We will not address this problem yet, but you should know it exists. A similar problem, which we will immediately address, is that there might be some risk associated with growing money at the discount rate. Let’s say you decided r = 10% because you were able to grow your investments by 10% last year. Maybe your investments will perform differently this year. Maybe they’ll even grow less. One way around this problem is to lower r to a growth rate you are confident you can achieve. However, even a smaller growth rate may have some risk. One approach to that problem is to try lowering r again. Ultimately, if you continue to trim r in this way, you could end up with r = 0%. At that discount rate, PV = FV and it has all kinds of funky repercussions over longer periods of time, though it is not uncommon to assume r=0% for simplicity’s sake over very short investment periods. I’m talking about such a short period of time that even using a high discount rate would not change the difference between PV and FV by a material amount because the time period is so short.

In the context of valuing options traded on a public exchange, it is conventional to assume that some institutions have the ability to lend and borrow at some rate above 0% without any risk. **This rate is a theoretical interest rate called “rf.”** The investors that can borrow and lend at rf are generally banks. The assumption of there being no risk comes from the idea that they are transacting at rf with the US government. The reason we can’t just ignore their riskless rate of lending and borrowing is that they have such an outsized impact on the capital markets that they have an effect on the price of virtually all financial instruments, including options. 

The assumption that borrowing and lending between the US government and banks carries no risk at all may bother some readers. If you don’t like that assumption, you might take comfort in the fact that rf is very low (as of the date of this post), so the effect on options valuation is often minimal compared to σ. In fact, rf is so low that some short term option valuations even assume rf is 0% for simplicity as mentioned above. Whether it’s a good assumption or not, using rf as a discount rate is conventional in options valuation as of the date of me writing this post. I don’t claim that models that rely on some positive value of rf are good or bad, but they are an industry standard, so it seems unreasonable to ignore them. 

To arrive at rf, a common convention is to start with the effective annual yield on a t-bill with a term roughly equivalent to the amount of time that is going to elapse for the purpose of your calculation. From there, depending on what you are using rf for, you might make some kind of adjustment for inflation. If you don’t know what an effective annual yield is, it’s the growth rate you would effectively get per year if you invested in something and it paid off expectedly, adjusting for the length of compounding periods. If you don’t know what a t-bill is, it’s a sort of debt issued by the US Government. T-bills can have various expirations, so keep that in mind if you are looking them up to try to calculate rf. 

If you want a quick way to do it, you are trading options with T under 1 year, and you don’t need a really precise estimate of rf to value an entire position down to a penny, the 1 year treasury rate is not a bad estimate (if it’s positive). If it’s negative, you might just use a very small number marginally higher than 0%. You don’t want to use 0% itself for reasons that will become clear later when we start talking about rho. 

If you are wondering at this point what happens if rates t-bills go negative, that’s a very academic question. Presumably, there is some collection of entities out there that do not need to pay to keep their money safe, so it is unclear if it’s ever possible to justify a negative rf. Additionally, a negative discount rate would imply PV &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt; FV, which has paradoxical implications.

The good news is that for expirations less than a year out especially, the impact of one reasonable rf assumption versus another on the value of an option will be minimal compared to the movement of the spot or IV. Later on, we will consider discount rates other than rf when we go on to discuss concepts outside of options valuation models themselves (such as the CAPM). 

For now, let’s apply what we have learned about PV and FV to the simplified binomial options valuation model from the last post.



**Incorporating Time and rf into the Model**

First, we will try this using many of same assumptions from the last post, namely:

* S will change exactly once
* When S changes, it changes in a single discrete movement, immediately before expiration
* The change will be an increase or decrease of exactly σ. However, at this point, we are going to stop thinking of σ in terms of dollars, and start defining it as an annual rate of change in S. You’ll see why in the next post.
* We ignore the theoretical possibility of selling or exercising between entry and the moment when S changes.

In the next post, we will add more nodes to the model. That is to say, we are going to incorporate the idea that S can change more than once. Since we are incorporating the idea of time into our model, that means each node can represent a period of time. That period of time can be as long or as short as we want it to be; we just need to modify σ accordingly, since the price of an asset can move more in a week than it can in a minute for example. From there, we can even assign probabilities to each movement between nodes. Some readers may intuit that, if we push this concept to its limit, we would end up with a probability distribution and nodes that deal with such tiny units of time that the movement of S becomes continuous rather than discrete. If you are one of those readers, I’m excited to show you the Black Scholes model later. If you aren’t sure what a probability distribution is or how discrete movement is different from continuous movement, don’t worry; you will know before you need to. And I’m excited to show you the Black Scholes model too. I don’t want you to feel left out.

That being said, we’ll wrap up this post by sticking to just one change in S so that we can view the impact of time in isolation compared to the model from the last post. We’ll run two examples; one easy example for a put expiring in a year, and one, rather difficult example, for a call expiring in less than a year.

**Let’s value the following put. S = 100 K= 90 σ = 20% (remember σ is expressed here as an annual rate of change), and rf = 1% compounding annually. Expiration is in 1 year (T = 1).** Notice that big T refers to the full amount of time between purchase and expiration, and little t refers to a specific time that may or may not be expiration. The distinction isn’t very important for this problem, since there is really only one length of time we are considering at the moment, but it will be when we need to consider more nodes.

First we check the up state (if S goes up).

S \* (1 + σ) = $100 \* (1 + 20%) = $120

K is less than $120, so the put has $0 of intrinsic value in the up state 

Now we look at the down state.

S \* (1 - σ) = $100 \* (1 - 20%) = $80

K is more than $80, so the put is worth something in the down state

K - $80 = $90 - $80 = $10, so the put has $10 on intrinsic value in the down state

$10 \* 50% + 0 \* 50% = $5. This much you should be familiar with if you read the last post.

Last time, we would have stopped here and said the put was worth $5, but in this case we are taking time into account. $5 is merely the FV of the put.

PV = FV / (1+rf)^t = $5 / (1 + 1%)^1 = $4.95 rounded to the nearest penny. **So the option is worth $4.95 right now.** 

Hopefully, this isn’t too hard compared to the last post. All we needed to do was think about σ a little differently and then apply the time value of money. This call option is going to be a little harder:

**Let’s value a call. S = $200, K = $210, σ = 10% (for a 90 day period), and rf = 1% (assuming annual compounding). The option expires in 90 days.** 

This is a tough problem. If you aren’t feeling brave, it’s ok to just follow along with what I’m doing here. There are a few ways to calculate this, and I’m deliberately picking a tough one because the easier ones require a little more conceptual knowledge. We need to make some adjustments because rf is compounding annually. We need to figure out a rate that would result in an annual growth rate or 1% if we compounded it every 90 days. For simplicity, we will assume a 360 day year (which is a common convention). Therefore, 90 days is ¼ of a year, and our rate needs to be something that compounds 4 times to get to a 1% annual rate. 

To get the exact same answer as me, I suggest either using a store function in your calculator when you get to a value for r or σ. Alternatively, try this problem in Excel. Otherwise, we’ll probably still get close if you round.

(1 + r)^4 = 1 + 1% = 1.01

1 + r = 1.01^(1/4)

r = (1.01^(1/4) )- 1

r = 0.2491%. This is the discount rate appropriate for 90 day compounding. 

Now we already have a 90 day σ. Normally, you would have a 1 year σ that you would need to convert to 90 days. That’s a bit different than converting a discount rate though, so I’m just taking a σ as given for this problem.

That may have been a bit tough for some of you. Don’t worry! We will introduce a concept soon called “log returns.” The concept of log returns is a little hard to grasp, but the math is far easier. I won’t ask you to run calculations like the above again, though you can for practice.

From here, things will look a lot like the put we just examined:

S \* (1 + σ) = $200 \* (1 + 10%) = $220

K is less than $220, so the call has intrinsic value in the up state

$220 - K = $220 - $210 = $10, so the call has $10 of intrinsic value in the up state

$200 &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt; K already, so it’s pointless to calculate the downstate. It would have no intrinsic value.

$10 \* 50% + $0 \* 50% = $5

PV = FV / (1+r)^t = $5 / (1 + 0.2491%)^1 = **$4.99 rounded to the nearest penny**. 

Notice how the final calculation considered t to be 90 days instead of 1 year. t can be whatever you want as long as your units are consistent, namely r (or rf) and σ. All else being equal, the option can’t get as far ITM if S doesn’t have as much time to move.

I know it doesn’t seem like these time value of money calculations are having a large effect on value. Consider the above call though; options trade in contracts of 100. If you considered the value of the call to be $5 and not $4.99, you would be willing to overpay by a dollar for every contract (assuming $4.99 is really the correct value). On a multi-leg strategy like we’ll go over later, this effect is multiplied. There is no need to overpay if it’s easy to avoid it. 



**Conclusion:**

You now have some idea of:

Discount rates, including rf

The difference between PV and FV

Why the above concepts are relevant to options valuation

Right now, we are part way through our overview of the binomial model. The version we are using right now is still simplified, but less so than the model from the last post. The next post will introduce some concepts that make it easier to apply the model from this post to lengths of time less than 1 year (so we don’t need to do so much difficult math). From there, we will start to look at adding more nodes to the model, by which point we will have arrived at something like a full binomial model. At that point, we’ll have achieved the minimum I think we need to start talking about the Black Scholes model. Many models used by professional traders are derived, so we’ll be able to take a close and critical look at some common trading strategies too. 

The math we went over in this post is pretty similar to the last post except with discounting applied, so I’m making the challenge question conceptual this time. The challenge will be more quantitative next time. 



**Challenge Question:**

Consider a call option with S = 10. Regardless of what K is, given sufficiently high (but not infinite) values for T, and σ, as well as a sufficiently low value for rf, **what is the theoretical maximum possible value of the option** in a reasonably efficient market? If the option somehow was trading higher than that value, **describe the resulting arbitrage opportunity**. In other words, how could a trader take advantage of it in a way that always results in profit without risk (barring some kind of force majeure)? 

As usual, I’ll gild the first parent level comment that gets the question correct in its entirety. Make sure you state the maximum value and describe the arbitrage opportunity. 

**One Last Thing**

If it’s alright, I’d like everyone’s opinion on something I’ve been considering for the series. I’ve had a few people ask me to include some analysis of actual trades, more practice questions, and some additional content about how the concepts in these posts apply to real life scenarios. I’m at the point right now where I want to provide that content, but it would require me to spend time on this project that I would normally use to screen for certain trades. In other words, there would be an opportunity cost to me adding this additional content. To get around that opportunity cost, I am considering setting up a Patreon account to take the edge off. Do you like this idea? If so, are there any other kinds of content you would like to see? I want to be fair to everyone here.

I'm hoping someone can point me to some state (New Mexico) or federal agencies I can submit a complaint to regarding my health insurance company (any other advice is of course also appreciated). The TL;DR is that my provider called the insurance requesting pre-authorization to render services, and was told by the insurance representative that it was not required by my plan. So, they obviously did not request the pre-authorization, and now the claims have been denied because it was in fact required by my plan. 

Since then, I have called several times asking the insurance company to listen to the original call to determine whether the representative made an error or not. I even provided them with the call ID from the call, so they can easily look it up. I've been told that's the ""last step"" they will take in this process, but first I have to make an appeal, the provider has to make a claim review, and some other stuff that was inconsistent between reps I talked to. Now, I'm submitting an appeal, but they have already denied the claim review made by the provider. I frankly don't expect anything different for my appeal. 

Is there some sort of regulatory agency I can submit a complaint to? I'm pretty ticked that they refuse to do the easiest thing possible to resolve the situation, but I imagine that's because they hope I'll just give up so they don't have to pay out. 

TIA!",finance

&gt;**Crisis Means a New Business Era**

&gt;***Cheap energy, a shift from China and remote work will all shape the long-term economy.***

&gt; *By Andy Kessler*

&gt;*March 15, 2020 7:12 pm ET*

&gt;The junk-bond-financed $6.75 billion buyout of United Airlines collapsed on Friday, Oct. 13, 1989. The stock market immediately dropped 191 points or almost 7%, equivalent to a 1,500-point drop today. Scary.

&gt;Rod Berens, head of research at Morgan Stanley at the time, called a departmentwide meeting after the market closed. I dreaded going. I had a list of tech stocks I was recommending that got killed that day. When I showed up, I noticed several cases of champagne—a weird way to celebrate the loss of wealth. But why not? I grabbed a glass; it was Friday.

&gt;And then my boss headed toward me. Uh oh, I thought, he’s going to fire me. Instead, he smiled, gave me a high-five and said, “Congratulations, now it’s your turn,” and clinked my glass. Talk about confused—one of the worst days in my professional life and I get congratulated?

&gt;I didn’t see it at the time, but he was dead right. Eras change, sometimes overnight. Over the next decade, the stock market shifted from junk-bond-fueled buyouts, a dominant Japan and the Cold War to highly valued emerging technology companies, ending with the dot-com blowout.

&gt;The current market turmoil tells me a new era is breaking, so question everything. Will cable, energy, mobile and social media ever come back? And if not, what’s next?

&gt;Well, the knee-jerk reactions will come first. Most think the 2003 SARS epidemic in China ushered in that country’s era of e-commerce, but it was going to happen anyway—the crisis only accelerated it. So be wary about talk of robot and drone deliveries. It may come to that if the virus spreads, but the economics still seem far out.

&gt;Will energy stay cheap forever after this week’s devastation? I doubt it, but the economy can finally benefit from fracking’s cheap natural gas. I’d bet so-called clean and renewable energy was set back a decade by having to compete with lower prices. Cheap fossil fuels may also push back any new adoption of carbon-free nuclear energy.

&gt;More interesting is the emptying of countless college campuses, sending students home. Classes will be online-only until further notice. Smart. But at some point parents will surely ask, “Why again are we paying 78 grand a year?” Is the end of universities far behind?

&gt;Similarly, lots of companies are telling employees to work at home. Will an era of telecommuting and no rush-hour traffic finally arrive? Maybe not. Recall that early in Marissa Mayer’s tenure as Yahoo CEO, she banned working from home because so many people were, as they say, mailing it in.

&gt;The end of China’s dominance is certainly coming. No one will ever again concentrate manufacturing in China alone. Vietnam and other countries with low-cost labor will benefit. Maybe this is Africa’s moment. Related: A louder globalization backlash may arise again—but since consumers like cheap goods, it will flame out.

&gt;Another observation: Interest rates and the Federal Reserve may be increasingly irrelevant. The Fed’s job seems to be to ensure the availability of Treasurys—mostly, as we wrote last September, as collateral for the repo market, which finances an increasing share of global trade. The $500 billion announced Thursday is encouraging.

&gt;What about mobile and cloud computing, and even the stock market and its trillion-dollar valuations? It’s worth asking, as venture capital and private equity using cheap debt are keeping companies private longer, or forever. Others think it is value stocks’ turn to shine, but that usually requires a period of inflation that I certainly don’t see coming. Quite the opposite.

&gt;No, growth will still rule, but with a different set of leaders. In the bio world, DNA sequencing and Crispr gene editing are starting to ramp up. Health care will be transformed by new ways to detect and treat cancer and other ways to cure previously incurable diseases like sickle-cell anemia.

&gt;In the high-tech world, mobile seems tired. Apple’s hottest product is AirPods Pro, those Star Wars-inspired white sticks hanging out of everyone’s ears. That’s an accessory, not an innovation. Here’s hoping for some knock-your-socks-off new mobile products. Note also that we’re only about a third of the way into the cloudification of enterprises. And we’re only beginning to master machine learning and artificial intelligence, with their ability to find patterns that humans can’t. I think the next tech era will be driven by implementation of AI-infused systems into every business.

&gt;Finally, I asked the man himself, Rod Berens, whom he’d high-five today. He says that the past 30 year’s tech abundance means the developing world’s billions will finally see productivity improvements and attract an increasing share of investment. That’s probably right.

&gt;New eras are notoriously hard to predict. So instead of focusing on which cities are quarantined, start thinking about what’s next. Very few investors do.

personalfinance,Secured Loan to pay off high interest credit card?,"First time posting here so if I’m not doing something right, I apologize. 

I am wanting advice on a secured loan to pay off 13k in credit card debt. I am 24 yrs old with 4 open balances &amp; a total credit line of 30k. 
I do not have the best credit ~650 was the last time I checked. When I was 18 I did the typical open up every credit card &amp; max it out all while working a minimum wage job. I very irresponsibly let over half of the cards I had go to collections. Fast forward to age 21, I then went through Lexington Law &amp; they helped remove a lot of the negative accounts on my report.

I have managed to pay down a huge chunk of what I still owed. Anyway, last year I opened a new card with a 0% APR (1 year promotion) to fund a cosmetic surgery that in total was 9k. I am now trying to pay this debt down and was wondering if it would be smart to get a secured loan. 
I haven’t added more to the balance of these credit cards &amp; don’t plan on it after paying them off. 

Other than the credit card debt I am pretty financially stable, I make about 40k a year now &amp; got very lucky where a relative left me a good amount of cash after passing. I bought &amp; fully paid off my house that was $135,000 &amp; also paid cash for my car. 
I put about 30% of my checks into saving. Pay about ~$400 &amp; pay double the minimum payments for each card. I then use what ever extra money I have on travel. (I know probably irresponsible since I could be using it to pay off debt. 

Now my question is, could I use my house for a secured loan to pay off my debt? I know I’d have a much easier time having one payment at a lower interest rate. 

Thanks in advance",finance
personalfinance,Pay down high interest credit card or play the long game?,"I have a financed vehicle that, admittedly, I shouldn't have bought when I did and rolled over some negative equity onto. I still owe around $23k on it with an interest rate around 6%. 

A friend of mine just gifted me their family's old 2002 Toyota Sequoia with around 300k. So far, I've put $300 into getting it running (timing belt/water pump, fresh gas) and it seems to run like a top.

I don't owe a whole lot in credit card debt but the interest rate is more than the newer vehicle. I suspect I could knock out about half of my debt by selling the Sequoia and applying that to my credit card. I'm also right around what the newer vehicle is worth and I could probably sell it and break even. 

I'm stuck between getting rid of a car that I like and enjoy driving and getting some debt stress off my shoulders. To me, it would seem wise to eliminate the higher car payment and suck it up for a while until I'm in a position to *actually* afford the car I drive. I'd just allocate the money I use for the newer vehicle towards the card and chip away at a slower pace. 

I'll admit that I'm not the best with money but I'm trying to be smarter with my spending.",finance
personalfinance,Refinance Suggestion,"My mortgage is @4.25 right now. Early march, I spoke to few lenders and they all wanted to refinance my loan ~3.5%. But I guessed it may go further down based on 10yr yield, corona etc. and waited until it hit the bottom. I started calling the lenders when it’s ~2.875%. No one answered my calls. I remember waiting on one call for ~3.5hrs that got disconnected. Today I see rates at 3.5% and keep hearing from people to wait for while as the rates will go down after the refinance demand goes down. 

One thing I’m not clear is that if the demand decreases, the rates will come down. As the rates come down, don’t the demand go up again? I’m worried that these low rates are only lasting for couple of hours.

Any suggestions on better interest rates local to GA?",finance
personalfinance,Refinancing my car,"So about a year and half ago I got a ""new"" car. My old one had broke down and was too expensive to fix for what it was worth. So I used the 500 on a downpayment instead to get something newer. Problem was then my credit was in bad shape(580 from one agency and around 610 from the other), so my interest rate is really high, 15% to be exact. Well I've rebuilt my credit and both scores are now over 760. My current loan is through Capital One, unfortunately I cannot refinance a loan I have through them, with them. So my question is, should i just try going to a local bank, such as a credit union, to refinance. Or are only of the places credit karma suggest actually worth it? Such as rate genius,  autopay, innovative funding solutions etc. The rates they're showing are between 2.5 and 3.5 percent, but reviews outside of their sites seem mixed.

personalfinance,"Just found out, when my employer hires a new employee, they do not take out federal and state taxes from their paychecks. Is there a reason behind this, that could benefit the employer?","This recently happened to one of my coworkers. No federal or state taxes were withheld form his checks and now he is stuck paying some money. Unfortunately, as I was doing my taxes, I realized the same happened to me. At first I took the situation up wit HR. After talking and fixing the situation, HR basically apologized and said it was their fault because they forgot to properly update my info in their system (from the form W-4), or simply forgot about the issue. Furthermore, HR basically said this never happens, and that it only happened to me but to not take it personal, because HR itself doesn't even know how it happened (according to HR). The last thing they said after their apology, was to not sue them for such a mistake. That it wont happen again. OFC it wont, not after I looked into it. 

This is where I got a bit skeptical. HR said this only happened to me, but a few days before is when my coworker confessed that this same thing happened to him. So I knew HR was lying, but I played along and just left it as is. Since then, I looked further into the matter and talked about tax season with some other coworkers. Eventually we were all finding out who paid and who got returns. When the question fell on me, I basically said I had to pay because of some confusion that has happened. I did not give out any specifics, and my coworkers already knew what I was talking about. They quickly asked, ""did HR not take out any taxes?"". Before I could even answer, they followed up by saying"" because did they same to some of us here"". After listening, there is no way HR can possibly be doing this on accident. According to my coworkers, this has happened to a few people here, and has only been corrected after the fact. There must be a reason for HR to do this right? Perhaps something that benefits the company? IDK but it just does not seem or feel right.

Does anyone have any thoughts about this? Is this sketchy, or did they genuinely make the same mistake over and over?",finance

In response to this, governments around the world took swift and decisive action to aid big corporations and bailout banks. The Federal Reserve rolled out a series of new policies which will [provide U.S. banks with $5.4 trillion in new funding](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/fed-offers-more-than-5-trillion-of-liquidity-to-quench-markets-1.1405088). Trump announced that the federal government would [purchase large quantities](https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/487495-trump-says-government-will-buy-crude-oil-to-help-industry) of crude oil to bailout [U.S. oil producers hurt by low oil prices](https://markets.businessinsider.com/commodities/news/oil-price-war-trigger-us-shale-defaults-financial-contagion-impact-2020-3-1028990295). The administration is also reportedly contemplating [*an $800 billion bailout*](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/trump-payroll-tax-cut-plan-obama-stimulus-financial-crisis-comparison-2020-3-1028991408) for U.S. companies. Over the weekend, the Federal Reserve announced another bailout, [promising to buy $700 billion in assets from U.S. banks](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2020/03/15/coronavirus-fed-cuts-rates-zero-agrees-buy-more-bonds/5054943002/), while also lowering interest rates to 0% and taking other measures to aid big banks. The Federal Reserve also announced increased currency swaps with the central banks in Japan, Switzerland, the U.K., and Europe in the face of [a massive U.S. dollar funding shortfall](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-liquidity-markets/explainer-dollar-demand-reveals-markets-pain-point-idUSKBN210307) that has emerged due the economic downturn and the virus.

All of this is part of a larger series of coordinated economic actions by governments around the world. In Germany the government announced [a 550 billion bailout for German companies](https://news.yahoo.com/germany-unleashes-biggest-post-war-aid-package-against-134124928.html), while also promising that there was “no upper limit” should a bigger bailout be needed. Speaking on this topic, German Economy Minister Peter Altmaier said, “we will reload our weapons if necessary.” In contrast, Germany has only allocated [€1 billion to fight Coronavirus](https://www.dw.com/en/coronavirus-germany-pledges-1-billion-to-tackle-outbreak/a-52698747). The Bank of Japan (the Japanese Central Bank), also engaged in unprecedented action, buying [101.4 billion yen ($939 million) in stock funds on Thursday](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/bank-of-japan-likely-to-strengthen-stimulus-next-week/ar-BB115Gan). This was the largest outright purchase of stock funds ever by the Bank of Japan. What’s more, [economists largely agree that the Bank of Japan will significantly increase its stock buying program next week](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-12/90-of-analysts-see-boj-adding-stimulus-over-virus-hit-survey).

Christine Lagarde, the current President of the European Central Bank and former Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund, called on European countries to take [“an ambitious and coordinated fiscal stance” to combat the “weakened \[economic\] outlook” from the virus.](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/12/ecb-announces-plan-to-help-eurozone-banks-withstand-coronavirus) While governments around the world have coordinated their financial bailouts of the big banks and multinational companies, the governments of the world have done little to coordinate their response to the virus. For example, in a recent televised address, [Trump referred to the Coronavirus as a “foreign virus” and announced a travel ban on Europe](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/12/world/europe/europe-coronavirus-travel-ban.html). In his speech Trump tried to deflect criticism of his administration’s negligence in responding to Coronavirus, by blaming European leaders for the virus’ spread in the U.S. His argument was that they were not quick enough to ban travel from China, and therefore European travelers seeded the U.S. with the virus. In response to the ban, Gérard Araud, French Ambassador to the U.S., tweeted:

&gt;📷[**Gérard Araud✔**@GerardAraud](https://twitter.com/GerardAraud) Trump needed a narrative to exonerate his administration from any responsibility in the crisis. The foreigner is always a good scapegoat. The Chinese has already been used. So, let’s take the European, not any European, the EU-one. Doesn’t make sense but ideologically healthy.  
[1,378](https://twitter.com/intent/like?tweet_id=1237916577858813959)[9:41 PM - Mar 11, 2020](https://twitter.com/GerardAraud/status/1237916577858813959) [Twitter Ads info and privacy](https://support.twitter.com/articles/20175256)

This blame-game is not isolated to the Trump administration. While politicians and officials in the EU like Christine Lagarde have called for unprecedented fiscal coordination in the EU, they have been unwilling to provide material and medical aid to other EU countries impact by the Coronavirus. For example, when Italy’s medical system first began to struggle with Coronavirus patients, the country requested assistance from the [Union Civil Protection Mechanism](https://ec.europa.eu/echo/what/civil-protection/mechanism_en), an EU Civil Protection Mechanism which has a mission to “improve prevention, preparedness and response to disasters.” [Not a single EU country sent Italy any medical supplies or assistance](https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/03/14/coronavirus-eu-abandoning-italy-china-aid/).

This in part reflects how unprepared other European countries are for this pandemic. However, it also shows deeper lack of coordination between them in this time of crisis. This includes not only the lack of sharing of medical supplies, but also the uncoordinated nature of efforts to contain the spread of the virus. Countries increasingly seek to blame each other for mishandling the Coronavirus, and this is not limited to the Trump administration. For instance, [the European Union just put a 30-day ban on non-essential travel](https://www.forbes.com/sites/isabeltogoh/2020/03/16/european-union-bans-non-essential-travel-for-at-least-30-days-amid-coronavirus-pandemic/#6d55a99b3544). While the central banks and governments of the world are coordinating a major financial bailout of the big banks and multinational companies, these same governments are also increasingly at odd with each other over how to respond to the virus.

This is not confined to Western countries. For example, Chinese state officials recently have been [spreading conspiracy theories that the US army brought the virus to Wuhan](https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/3075227/why-china-amplifying-conspiracy-theory-blame-america-coronavirus). This is not an isolated incident, and [Chinese state media has increasingly been pushing this narrative](https://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1182694.shtml)[1](https://revolutionaryunitedfront.com/coronavirus/governments-around-the-world-prioritize-saving-big-banks-over-stopping-the-coronavirus/#fn:1). This reflects the interests of the Chinese state to use this crisis to its geopolitical advantage. In fact, the pandemic has also become a site of geopolitical competition between the U.S. and China. After initially praising Xi Jinping’s response, [Trump has repeatedly blamed China for the Coronavirus](https://nationalinterest.org/feature/donald-trumps-new-coronavirus-strategy-blame-china-130892). This is the logical result of years of sharpening competition between the U.S. and China.

Even one of the few examples of international aid by governments seems to be part of this logic of crude geopolitical calculus. Recently, [China sent medical experts and medical supplies to Italy](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3074682/china-sends-team-medical-experts-gear-help-italy-fight) to aid in the fight against Coronavirus. In a related initiative, [eastern Zhejiang province in China donated masks to help overseas Chinese in Italy](https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/china-offers-medical-aid-to-italy-to-fight-coronavirus-chinese-foreign-minister). While framed by the Chinese state as a benevolent effort to help Italy and overseas Chinese there, the reality is that this part of China’s larger geopolitical strategy. In March 2019, [Italy joined China’s Belt and Road Initiative](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-47679760). The Belt and Road Initiative is a major aspect of China’s efforts to overtake the U.S. as the leading global superpower. The right-wing in the U.S. is [acutely aware China’s maneuvers globally during this pandemic.](https://www.foxnews.com/media/michael-pillsbury-american-media-chinese-intimidation)

But despite their discomfort, as the Trump administration continues to mismanage the domestic, public health, and geopolitical aspects of this pandemic, it is likely that relatively basic maneuvers by China at this time will continue to boost its geopolitical strength and influence relative to the United States.

personalfinance,How to strengthen credit score with auto loan for a cheap vehicle?,"Hi folks.  I recently increased my salary and want to purchase a vehicle because I need one and because I'd like to strengthen my credit history for a mortgage down the road.

Here's the catch - my ideal vehicle is an old Tacoma and the vehicle will probably run me at most 10-12k.  I could easily pay with cash after some time saving money, but I've never had an auto loan and as a 27 year old, my credit history is brief.

Interest rates on older vehicles are much higher, and it's my understanding that if I take out a loan and pay it off very quickly (to minimize interest payments), my credit score won't fortify as much as it would if I took more time to pay off the loan.

What are my strategies here?  Do I buy a more expensive vehicle if my credit score is my priority?

personalfinance,Would love advice on decision with refinancing student loans and purchasing land given current state of affairs. Thanks!,"Before coronavirus really took off, my husband and I had planned to refinance his student loans as well as purchase a lot of land connecting to our current property. I would love advice on both these decisions given the current circumstances. 

About us: My husband and I are in our mid-30's and have a 7 month old son. My husband is employed and I just got laid off but have severance coverage through the end of the year. I work in the tourism industry so there is a decent chance finding a job could be tough. We could probably squeeze by on my husband's income, but it  would be difficult, so I want to make sure we have some cash on hand if we need to cover ourselves into next year. Here are our stats: 

* $135k combined pre-tax income (until severance runs out then it would drop to $60k)
* $75k in accessible savings/ emergency fund
* $127k mortgage at 3.95% interest rate ($760 monthly payment, we pay $100-300 more whenever we can)/ 30 year loan
* $24k federal student loans at approx 6.75% interest ($200 min payment but we pay $500/month with goal of eliminating it in next 5 years)
* $4k in car loan at 2.99% interest rate ($200 min payment but we pay $300/month)
* We do have money in 401ks and Roths for retirement that probably totals around $150k at this point
* Both of us have great credit (one above 750 and one above 800) 

My questions:

1) About two weeks ago I looked into refinancing the student loans and was able to lock into a 3.95% interest rate / 7 year loan ($320 monthly payment) with private lender Sofi. I could have gotten 3.5% for a 5 year, but wanted a little extra wiggle room on payments just in case. We would still plan to try and pay $500/month for as long as we can as we really want to be done with these loans in 4-5 years. I reached out to sofi and asked if better rates were available now and they said no. Should we be able to find better rates at this point or should I sign the papers for what I have? I know federal loans might go interest free for a while, but Im feeling like the guaranteed low interest rate now is worth it. Am I wrong? 

2) We have been in talks to purchase a lot of land behind our current house. Given the location, this isnt something we can wait on because we specifically want this piece based on the benefits it will provide in our current home value and space. The lot is $35k and we had planned on purchasing it outright with our savings. With everything going on, I am questioning if it wouldnt be better to get a loan for it (assuming we can get something with a lower interest rate) which would allow us to keep more money in our emergency fund which would make me feel a little safer going into the unknown. Is this good thinking or should we just pay cash as planned? What would be the best route on getting it financed? When I look at places like Sofi and Lightstream it seems like there are rates around 6-7% for personal loans which seems high. Can you get a loan for land via a home loan or is it just a personal loan? Any other advice here? 

3) Bonus Question- Should we refinance our home right now? We plan to keep it for the long haul (eventually as a rental if we move to a bigger house- it is in a tourist town and is ideal for a rental, part fo the reason we purchased it)

personalfinance,Closing credit card account vs paying monthly fee?,"I (32 F) am working on rebuilding my credit after making mistakes when I was younger (18-24). I have been responsible with credit and making regular, on-time payments for the last 6-8 years. 

I recently paid off a credit card account that had a relatively low balance, and a high interest rate. I am still being charged a fee of $8 every month towards the annual fee. This account has been open for 1 year, 8 months. My other three credit cards still have relatively high balances, 80-90%, so this unused credit card is really helping my total credit usage percent, and adding to my length of credit history and number of open accounts. 

That being said, I hate paying a monthly fee on a card that I’m not using. Is it better to close this account and be rid of it, or keep it open for the potential benefits?",finance

I basically want to know how I can take out a huge personal loan as close to $50k as possible with a lower interest rate than my credit cards. One card has $35k on it and the rest of the debt is split between other 2-3 cards. The card with $35k is a Capital One Business Spark card and my interest fee was $500 this month. Any info on which bank to walk into and what to tell them would be appreciated greatly. 

On top of that, I’ve moved in to my mom’s home temporarily while I take care of this debt. So $0 on rent and food for now. We pay $175/mo for car insurance and $560/mo for health insurance. 

Lastly, I am on a payment plan with the IRS for $1350/mo until November.

My businesses had major losses last year ($100k loss) and I have filed my business tax returns, but not personal yet. I don’t think I should owe anything in taxes this year and my wife may be eligible for a return because of it. 

I just got a job that is online based and pays $500/wk plus monthly bonuses of roughly $500-1,000.

I should also be getting hired soon for a job at an office that will pay $40k a year. 

I believe I can turn my business around this year and hope to make at least $1,000 in net profit per month but it could easily be 10x higher. I’m just not banking on that right now and thinking very conservatively.

My wife makes about $2,000/mo. 

It’s looking like my monthly income may be as high as $9,000 or $10,000. My expenses are very minimal right now but I’d say I’ll spend about $500-1000 a month on things. 

What is the best way for me to go about eliminating this debt immediately? I’m happy to answer more questions if you need more info from me.",finance

In response to this, governments around the world took swift and decisive action to aid big corporations and bailout banks. The Federal Reserve rolled out a series of new policies which will [provide U.S. banks with $5.4 trillion in new funding](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/fed-offers-more-than-5-trillion-of-liquidity-to-quench-markets-1.1405088).

The administration is also reportedly contemplating [*an $800 billion bailout*](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/trump-payroll-tax-cut-plan-obama-stimulus-financial-crisis-comparison-2020-3-1028991408) for U.S. companies. Over the weekend, the Federal Reserve announced another bailout, [promising to buy $700 billion in assets from U.S. banks](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2020/03/15/coronavirus-fed-cuts-rates-zero-agrees-buy-more-bonds/5054943002/), while also lowering interest rates to 0% and taking other measures to aid big banks. The Federal Reserve also announced increased currency swaps with the central banks in Japan, Switzerland, the U.K., and Europe in the face of [a massive U.S. dollar funding shortfall](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-liquidity-markets/explainer-dollar-demand-reveals-markets-pain-point-idUSKBN210307) that has emerged due the economic downturn and the virus.

All of this is part of a larger series of coordinated economic actions by governments around the world. In Germany the government announced [a 550 billion bailout for German companies](https://news.yahoo.com/germany-unleashes-biggest-post-war-aid-package-against-134124928.html), while also promising that there was “no upper limit” should a bigger bailout be needed. Speaking on this topic, German Economy Minister Peter Altmaier said, “we will reload our weapons if necessary.” In contrast, Germany has only allocated [€1 billion to fight Coronavirus](https://www.dw.com/en/coronavirus-germany-pledges-1-billion-to-tackle-outbreak/a-52698747). The Bank of Japan (the Japanese Central Bank), also engaged in unprecedented action, buying [101.4 billion yen ($939 million) in stock funds on Thursday](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/bank-of-japan-likely-to-strengthen-stimulus-next-week/ar-BB115Gan). This was the largest outright purchase of stock funds ever by the Bank of Japan. What’s more, [economists largely agree that the Bank of Japan will significantly increase its stock buying program next week](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-12/90-of-analysts-see-boj-adding-stimulus-over-virus-hit-survey).

Christine Lagarde, the current President of the European Central Bank and former Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund, called on European countries to take [“an ambitious and coordinated fiscal stance” to combat the “weakened \[economic\] outlook” from the virus.](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/12/ecb-announces-plan-to-help-eurozone-banks-withstand-coronavirus) While governments around the world have coordinated their financial bailouts of the big banks and multinational companies, the governments of the world have done little to coordinate their response to the virus. For example, in a recent televised address, [Trump referred to the Coronavirus as a “foreign virus” and announced a travel ban on Europe](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/12/world/europe/europe-coronavirus-travel-ban.html). In his speech Trump tried to deflect criticism of his administration’s negligence in responding to Coronavirus, by blaming European leaders for the virus’ spread in the U.S. His argument was that they were not quick enough to ban travel from China, and therefore European travelers seeded the U.S. with the virus. In response to the ban, Gérard Araud, French Ambassador to the U.S., tweeted:

&gt;📷[**Gérard Araud✔**@GerardAraud](https://twitter.com/GerardAraud) Trump needed a narrative to exonerate his administration from any responsibility in the crisis. The foreigner is always a good scapegoat. The Chinese has already been used. So, let’s take the European, not any European, the EU-one. Doesn’t make sense but ideologically healthy.  
[1,378](https://twitter.com/intent/like?tweet_id=1237916577858813959)[9:41 PM - Mar 11, 2020](https://twitter.com/GerardAraud/status/1237916577858813959) [Twitter Ads info and privacy](https://support.twitter.com/articles/20175256)

This blame-game is not isolated to the Trump administration. While politicians and officials in the EU like Christine Lagarde have called for unprecedented fiscal coordination in the EU, they have been unwilling to provide material and medical aid to other EU countries impact by the Coronavirus. For example, when Italy’s medical system first began to struggle with Coronavirus patients, the country requested assistance from the [Union Civil Protection Mechanism](https://ec.europa.eu/echo/what/civil-protection/mechanism_en), an EU Civil Protection Mechanism which has a mission to “improve prevention, preparedness and response to disasters.” [Not a single EU country sent Italy any medical supplies or assistance](https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/03/14/coronavirus-eu-abandoning-italy-china-aid/).

This in part reflects how unprepared other European countries are for this pandemic. However, it also shows deeper lack of coordination between them in this time of crisis. This includes not only the lack of sharing of medical supplies, but also the uncoordinated nature of efforts to contain the spread of the virus. Countries increasingly seek to blame each other for mishandling the Coronavirus, and this is not limited to the Trump administration. For instance, [the European Union just put a 30-day ban on non-essential travel](https://www.forbes.com/sites/isabeltogoh/2020/03/16/european-union-bans-non-essential-travel-for-at-least-30-days-amid-coronavirus-pandemic/#6d55a99b3544). While the central banks and governments of the world are coordinating a major financial bailout of the big banks and multinational companies, these same governments are also increasingly at odd with each other over how to respond to the virus.

This is not confined to Western countries. For example, Chinese state officials recently have been [spreading conspiracy theories that the US army brought the virus to Wuhan](https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/3075227/why-china-amplifying-conspiracy-theory-blame-america-coronavirus). This is not an isolated incident, and [Chinese state media has increasingly been pushing this narrative](https://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1182694.shtml)[1](https://revolutionaryunitedfront.com/coronavirus/governments-around-the-world-prioritize-saving-big-banks-over-stopping-the-coronavirus/#fn:1). This reflects the interests of the Chinese state to use this crisis to its geopolitical advantage. In fact, the pandemic has also become a site of geopolitical competition between the U.S. and China. After initially praising Xi Jinping’s response, [Trump has repeatedly blamed China for the Coronavirus](https://nationalinterest.org/feature/donald-trumps-new-coronavirus-strategy-blame-china-130892). This is the logical result of years of sharpening competition between the U.S. and China.

Even one of the few examples of international aid by governments seems to be part of this logic of crude geopolitical calculus. Recently, [China sent medical experts and medical supplies to Italy](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3074682/china-sends-team-medical-experts-gear-help-italy-fight) to aid in the fight against Coronavirus. In a related initiative, [eastern Zhejiang province in China donated masks to help overseas Chinese in Italy](https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/china-offers-medical-aid-to-italy-to-fight-coronavirus-chinese-foreign-minister). While framed by the Chinese state as a benevolent effort to help Italy and overseas Chinese there, the reality is that this part of China’s larger geopolitical strategy. In March 2019, [Italy joined China’s Belt and Road Initiative](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-47679760).

personalfinance,Need some advice on mortgage refinancing process...,"Hi all. So, when the mortgage rate dropped out to its lowest level I tried to lock in with two lenders, the small-time guy who helped me buy my house who I (more or less) trust, and also Quicken Loans, as I was scouting around to see what different companies could do for me. Unfortunately my small agent didn't manage to get his lock while Quicken did, so on that day I locked a refi @ 3.125%. I know that's not as low as some but I have low equity in my house which I just bought during the latter part of 2018 (~140k left on a loan amount of ~148k, house valued at ~160k).

My small-time guy was however able to get me a rate lock at a slightly earlier time, when he got me ~3.5% (which was good for the market on that day). For reference, my small-time guy's name is Rob.

So my question is this. Here are the numbers I'm looking at:
&amp;nbsp;

**Quicken's:**

Loan amount: $149,500

Interest rate: 3.125%

Princ. &amp; Inter: $640.43

Est. Taxes/Ins./Asses: $354

Est. Total monthly payment: $1,003

Est. Closing costs: $8,120

Est. Cash to close: $1,530

Origination Charges: $3,364 for 2.25% in points, processing fee $900, underwriting fee $350

In 5 years:

...will have paid $46,395 in total costs

...will have paid off $16,284 in principal

APR 3.54%

Total Int. Percentage 54.17%

**Rob's:**

Loan amount: $144,000

Interest rate: 3.5%

Princ. &amp; Inter: $646.62

Est. Taxes/Ins./Asses: $326

Est. Total monthly payment: $972

Est. Closing costs: $6,270

Est. Cash to close: $39

Origination Charges: $574 administration fee, $325 processing fee, no points fees

In 5 years:

...will have paid $42,534 in total costs

...will have paid off $14,836 in principal

APR 3.633%

Total Int. Percentage 61.715%

&amp;nbsp;
Can somebody who knows more than me take a look at this and tell me whether Quicken's numbers seem to stink as much as I feel like they do? My small-time guy says they are definitely giving me a bad deal, however of course I'd expect that out of two competing business people. The guy from Quicken states that I'd be getting ~$2k back and that accounts for some of the costs. I'm not knowledgeable enough to understand all the numbers but I feel like something is wrong here?

personalfinance,Amortization Table for Student Loans,"Does anyone know some of the underlying math mechanics that the federal gov't uses when calculating student loans?  I am trying to build an amortization table and the numbers I am getting are a bit off from what Navient is suggesting.  To calculate the monthly interest, I am dividing my APR by 12, then multiplying that rate by the outstanding balance.  The amount paid to principal each month is the montly payment minus that interest payment.  I am then using a goal seek on the monthly payment that will  set the final balance to $0.00 at the end of 10 years.

I have also tried doing it on a daily basis \[APR/ 365 \* # of days in month\*outstanding balance\], even accounting for leap years and cannot get the numbers to match.

Goal of this is to assess whether I should keep my loans with the federal govt while there are no interest payments or go ahead an refinance \[was in the middle of this process prior to COVID-19 going crazy\].",finance

personalfinance,IF the interest rate on federal student loans doesn't truly temporarily get set to 0%... what's the smartest play?,"Until it happens, I'm going to be skeptical about the temporary 0% interest rate on USA federal student loans. But let's say it does happen. For someone paying more than the minimum on those loans, what's the smart play? Couple options I can think of-

* Option 1- Keep paying more than the minimum on the federal loans with a 0% rate

* Option 2- Drop monthly payments to the minimum and use the difference to pay down other debt (i.e. private student loans where interest rates will not drop to 0) as long as the federal loan rate stays at 0%

* Option 3- Drop monthly payments to the minimum and invest the difference as long as the federal loan rate stays at 0%

Let's assume we already have a 6-month e-fund and no other significant or high-rate debt. I see pros and cons to each option-

* Option 1. Pros- Take advantage of a 0% rate with payments going fully to the principal balance and making good progress on the loans in a short period of time. Cons- Isn't financially optimal as paying the minimums on 0% and extra on debt with a higher rate

* Option 2. Pros- Seems like the financially optimal method. Cons- basically the same thing as the pro for option 1

* Option 3. Pros- Best of both worlds, in a sense, letting extra money grow while the loan rate stays at 0%. Cons- Isn't an aggressive approach to paying back loans

Obviously a lot of this would be very situational and dependent on where a certain individual is and what their goals are. But does anyone have some general thoughts to what they would do or recommend if we do turn out to have a period of a 0% rate on federal student loans?",finance

bonds,Betting Against Corporate Bond Funds,"I'm thinking through a short term options strategy to bet against the corporate bond market. I am doing research, pulling back the layers of Bond Funds, but certainty am no expert so hoping for some insight.

**My Theory:** Short term risks are high that bonds may be sold off for liquidity/collateral, and/or BBB rated bonds get downgraded to Junk Bonds, and/or ill-positioned companies begin to default.

**My Play:** LQD (iShares Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF) to $ 116.50 or lower by by 6/19. This fund is 50+% weighted in BBB bonds.

**Assumptions: Prior to Current Market**

\- Years of low interest rates &amp; Bull Market have companies over valued and over leveraged.

\- High increase in BBB rated companies, some of which may be over rated as is (due to the above points) and/or add risk of being downgraded (due to the below points)

**Assumptions: Current Market**

* Corporate bonds may be sold off by MMs either for immediate liquidity or lieu of better collateral (Treasuries)
* BBB bonds may be dropped if viewed at risk of downgrade/will drop if downgraded.
* Banks may struggle to provide all the short term liquidity to all who need it.
* Supply/Demand chain disruptions and falling stock prices may push BBB companies into junk bond status, and/or make it more difficult for them to get new lines of credit, and/or default on their current debt.

**My Questions**

* Am I making any incorrect assumptions?
   * ex. If LQD replaces risky or downgraded bonds does it avoid the risk?
* Am I missing anything?
   * ex. Will LQD see a big boost of the Fed gets approved to add Corporate Bonds to their holdings?
* Am I fighting too hard upstream here? In other words if my assumptions ultimately prove correct:
   * Will I see higher return betting against High Yield Junk Bond funds?
   * Or simply against a broader market fund like S&amp;P 500 or Russell 2000.

I left that job six months ago for a new employer.  At my new employer I am contributing to a 401k.  I didn't want to roll in my state account to my new account because I would have lost my years of service, and I thought I may want to return there one day.  However, I don't think I will return, and if I did return I have the option of buying back my four years of service.  I plan to stay in my current job for at least five years.

I am also in the process of saving for a new home.  I was thinking of possibly using my state retirement savings to pay for a new home because you can withdraw from your retirement without penalty for a first time home purchase (right?).  So I'm trying to see what I should do:

&amp;#x200B;

A. Use my state retirement fund to contribute to a down payment on a house.

B. Roll my state retirement fund into my current retirement account so I have just one active retirement account.

C. Keep things the way they are.

personalfinance,How to maximize benefits on market crash for young adults,"24, engaged to girlfriend, (technically already married a couple years ago for school benefits). We are now saving for a wedding (her parents will pay for it we think, but saving as if they wont to be safe). 

She's nurse, I'm a project engineer at a large construction management firm. 

Income combined $84,000/year after taxes, health insurance, and her 401k

Student loan debt $655/mo minimum with average 5% interest rate. Can't remember total premiums off the top of my head, about $55,000 before we started paying. 

One vehicle loan for $16,000 left at 4% 

Her company matches some 457b, but only gets a match if she stays for 3+ years. We travel alot for my job, so we started putting an additional amount in an Roth IRA for her. 

I put $300/mo in my IRA, have a company pension, paid health benefits, etc 

After all expenses(additional $300 into savings) we have about $2,000 left over in discretional spending. 

Due to moving around, we aren't necessarily planning to buy a house or start a family anytime soon. We have three dogs.

Our Emergency fund has $18,000 with a total of $4,700 in average monthly spending that is things we always spend money on, loans, dedicated fun money (gets blown out into the discretionary a lot of times), medicines which mine is non essential, subscriptions, etc. 

We have a vacation fund with $10,000 in it.
We have a random savings account with $6,000.
We probably have about $8,000-10,000 in checking account. We use credit cards for everything and pay off the statements, depends on when pay day falls and when credit card payments draft. Sometimes if it's large I pay it off earlier just because I hate seeing the high bill.

Assume that our retirement accounts have $4,000 because we haven't been paying much and started later than our jobs started a couple years ago. 

While the market is down, should we funnel more money into out IRAs? Open an investing account in the same company through our IRAs and buy ETFs and Mutual funds? Funnel the money at student loans (hoping to get more than 5.5% ROI while things are down now)

Schwab charges like $6? For every trade in an investment account which stinks, I have been using Robinhood the past few days to play around and buy $20 of some stocks here and there (Microsoft, SPDR, Tesla, etc.)

Leave things as is and live comfortably, and increase retirement funding and decrease student loans faster? Currently paying the normal amount for the regular repayment, occasionally send a lump sum extra to a certain high interest loan. We just paid one off that was about 6.5%.

Also worth noting given Jamie Dimon's previous commitment was this one at the end:

&gt; JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co, the largest U.S. bank by assets, said in February that it had decided it can hold less cash for its resolution plan, and instead, factor in the possibility of using the discount window. 

Obviously we'll see what happens going forward but this seems like positive sign that banks are onboard with utilizing the these Fed programs to help stabilize some of this disruptions that have been occurring in fixed income markets lately and maybe even expand lending here.

Most small businesses won’t be able to stay open due to the state and federal mandates but they will still be responsible for fixed costs.  Their employees will most likely be laid off.  Even when they reopen we run the risk of multiple  spreads of this virus as the incubation period is to long to really contain it.  Am I seeing this wrong?

How could the economy ever be considered to be doing great before the covid outbreak? How can an economy that has perpetual mega deficits be sustainable and therefore in great shape?

personalfinance,"Escrow closing during SF Bay Area ""shelter in place""?","I'm just throwing this out there to see what people can offer in terms of advice or informed guesses: I had an offer accepted for a single family home a little over 1 week ago. I'm a first time buyer. The house is in the SF Bay Area. I was pre-approved for a really low interest rate on a 30 yr mortgage with one of the major national banks (locked in on what is so far the perfectly timed day). I've been handling all of the paperwork with our lending officer, and things are proceeding through the steps. The appraisal visit happened at the end of last week. I haven't received the report yet, but our loan officer said he'd share it once he has it.

Escrow close date is in the middle of the 3 week Bay Area ""shelter in place"" order. What the heck now? This is obviously unprecedented territory, but any guesses as to how this might all play out? My current 1 year lease ends at the end of April, and I haven't heard from our landlord whether they want us to sign a new 1 year lease or will allow us to continue month to month. Before this pandemic escalation hit, I figured the timing would work out perfectly (even though we didn't try to plan it that way) -- we would move into our new house and have only 2-3 weeks left on our current 1 year lease, so we'd be done with the lease and not have to consider renewing it.

I figure we're totally fine in terms of having a place to stay. There's no way our landlord has any leverage to force us to sign a new 1 year lease or tell us to vacate in the middle of the shelter in place. I of course will continue to pay all rent that is owed as long as we are in our current leased housing.

Sorry this is a bit rambling. My question is what guesses people have about my situation and how it might play out with where we are in escrow. It seems like a shelter in place order shouldn't impede the progress with closing, especially since the appraisal visit already happened. Beyond that, the seller put in the contract a rent back provision that we agreed to. If the shelter in place order is extended, which honestly seems very likely, then I suppose it would be reasonable for the seller and I to maybe either formally or informally extend the rent back # of days, and I just continue to rent it back to the seller as long as the seller requests?

This is a crazy time for a first time home buyer to be closing... literally in the middle of an order not to leave your home.

&amp;#x200B;

Update 3/17 --

1. appraisal was completed, and a tad above purchase price.
2. just received ""conditional loan approval"" titled ""MORTGAGE LOAN COMMITMENT"", and it states that the expiration date (for us) is when the rate lock expires, which is April 22 (roughly 3 weeks after escrow is supposed to close)

btc,BTC VS BCH,"I think something that BCH has going for it over BTC is the fact of the name. The terminology of incorporating ""cash"" into the name makes people more accepting from the get go. I think from a marketing and psychological perspective people feel more comfortable as it resonates with their old way of doing things, cash. I believe in terms of widespread adoption BCH has an advantage due to this marketing ploy, and when dealing with the masses or lowest common denominator, if we what widespread adoption then we need to target biases. Take the federal reserve for example, in no way is this a federal organization, however the majority of people believe this to be exactly that and have faith and trust in it. 

I think this point should be kept in mind. Bitcoin is associated with volatility, get rich kick schemes and vagueness by those we need to adopt it in daily life. I believe these same people will see BCH cash as the ""cash version"" or "" evolution"" of bitcoin, something that holds authenticity and authority, that is  in some way ""cash"" or linked/backed by cash. I believe we would be naive to forget about the psychological, emotional and biases held by the people.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.

The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

personalfinance,Landlord trying to raise rent &gt;20%,"Conclusion: I've talked pretty extensively with my SO and considered a lot of the comments. A lot of perspective was offered that I didn't have before so thank you.

I don't hold anything against him for the rent raise. We do just have different needs.  I definitely panicked a bit because I received the email while in the middle of a pretty serious work emergency and some of that energy carried over. He's never been a bad guy. A bit of a penny pincher, but I can't really blame him for that when he owns a dozen houses and I'm only renting one.

After looking at properties up for rent in the area, it looks like we have more options within my price range now than I've ever had in my life. I think I sent out probably 30+ requests for showings before even realizing how ridiculous that was (they're all great places) 

I'm going to thank him for my time here tomorrow and start planning on moving out. My needs have changed a lot in the past year and honestly I'm glad he brought it up because I'm now realizing that even if he'd kept the rent at 1800, I'd probably still have left if I had actually known what the market was like right now and what I could actually afford. Between all the debt I've paid off and the work I've put into advancing my career, it's obvious to me now that we're simply in a different market now regardless of any other factors. 

Maybe this property is worth 2200 to someone, my needs/wants are so far away from what I have now however, that I honestly can't even say. I started looking at houses around 2200 but by the time I hit the 2600 range and realised that they were ""practically the same price"" it dawned on me that I've spent so much time working on getting my life squared away that I'd completely lost perspective on what I had actually accomplished and now I feel like an ass.  If I could leave here right now and move into a place that costs 50% more without issue, then I'm obviously I'm in no position to pretend I have any actual perspective on the value of what I have now.

~~Edit: *I actually went to look at another place a few hours ago. Before I even got to the house I got an email offering 1000$ off the first months rent for properties owned by the company that owns the one I looked at. Thats just making me feel even more certain.*~~

~~&gt;*For a limited time only, you’re invited to save when you lease your dream home in the neighborhood you want. On select homes, receive $1,000 off your first month’s rent with a lease starting on or before 3/31/2020. Look for the specials on select homes on invitationhomes.com.*~~

~~I just got a message today from my landlord. The lease is coming up and he decided that he wants to raise my rent from 1800 to 2200. He claims that he had a discussion with someone who told him that ""The market would bear it""~~

~~Originally I was concerned. Then I started looking at properties in the area, and most of them are currently lowering rent. As a matter of fact, for the price he wants to charge (2br/2ba) I can now get a 4br/3ba with a pool, less than 5 miles away. For an extra 200 over that, I can get the same thing on the end of a cul-de-sac where the back yard overlooks miles of nature preserve. I called three places *tonight*, and all three of them offered showings within the next 24 hours.~~

~~Originally I had thought he was just ""incorrectly informed"" but the more I think about it, the more I feel like it might be more than that. I'm starting to think he might be scared, and trying to milk me for cash. He even mentioned not raising the rent for a few months as a result of the virus, but I'm starting to think he's just trying to use that to hide how shitty of an ""offer"" he's making me, and making it seem like hes doing me a favor.~~

~~I haven't been doing this for long. I'm still young and I have a lot to learn about how events like this effect the economy (I'm still working on figuring out *my own* finances). What I do know, is that I've never missed rent in my life, my credit score is up over 100 points since I signed the lease with him, the extra 400$ hes trying to charge me isn't going to affect my budget in any significant way, and I have no concerns about my job security at any point in the near future as I'm essentially indispensable to my company (I bring in more money a week than I make in a year, and apparently I'm the only one who even understands *how*)~~

~~I cant imagine a world in which he could *possibly* be justified in what hes doing. My lease is up in a month and honestly I'd be surprised if the rental market was booming right now. I keep reading posts from people talking about how due to the recent fed rate cut, now is one of the best times to *buy* a home. I also imagine that considering how many people are worried about being able to afford food right now, that hes not going to have a lot of people beating down his door to rent a place.~~

~~Honestly even if I could talk him back down to 1800, I dont think it would be worth the effort. It wasn't particularly worth the price in the first place and I mostly took it as a matter of convenience. I'd probably not have even thought twice about renewing the lease at that price but now it just seems silly.~~

~~What I really want to know is, who has the power right now?~~

~~Does any of this actually ring true?~~

~~If I've finally managed to catch myself in a lucky situation where I actually have some kind of leverage, I feel like it would be dumb of me not to take advantage of it. Should I be focused simply on trying to find somewhere else to live right now, or should I be trying to leverage my financial security to get a better deal (somewhere else) with a longer lease, while everyone is panicking?~~",finance
personalfinance,Confused about the taxes taken out of my paycheck. My paycheck amount has randomly decreased and I realize my employer only recently started taking money away for federal income taxes.,"I’m 20 years old, unmarried and make $17.50/hr. My total earnings in a paycheck pre-taxed averages around $1,300 and I used to get taxed around $100, having a net pay of $1,200. I started to notice that my past two paychecks (starting 02/28/2020) have been taxed $100 extra bringing my net pay to $1,100. 

I don’t usually check my pay stubs since they don’t come with my paychecks as I’m enrolled in direct deposit but I did after I started noticing these decreases in pay. I realized in these past two checks, they started taking taxes from “Federal Income Tax” and “Employee Medicare”. Looking at every paystub prior to these past two, they have only been taking taxes for Social Security and state income tax.

I assumed I was paying federal income tax this entire time and now I’m worried that this will affect me somehow this tax season. Considering my pay rate, is $100 too little an amount to be taxed in the first place? Was I supposed to be paying $200 out of my paychecks this entire time?

stocks,Federal reserve reduces the cash reserve requirement of banks to ZERO.,"Meaning that banks can hold a big zero as their cash reserve. This allows them to make as many loans as they want, while putting all of their FDIC accounts (depositors) at risk. 

This is actually the reason why I’m not a fan of FDIC insurance. It gives banks the option to act hazardous, while still keeping confidence in its depositors through government backed insurance. This has allowed banks to over-leverage themselves. You used to check on the bank’s investments before depositing.  

You may want to get some cash on hand. They have frozen the banks before in dire financial moments. At the least, they’ll limit how much cash you can withdraw at a time; which I’ve experienced in multiple countries, who were under the same situation.

Just to go on a side rant for a second. I just find it annoying how withdrawing over 10 grand, puts a red flag on you for the IRS. They don’t red flag people on the deposit...don’t be surprised if you can’t get your money when you want it.",finance

Forex,Thoughts On The Market Series #1 - The New Normal?,"# Market Outlook: What to Make of This “New Normal”

**By \*\*\*\*\***

*March 16, 2020*

After an incredibly volatile week – which finished with the Dow Jones Industrial Average rallying over 9% on Friday – I suppose my readers might expect me to be quite upbeat about the markets.

Unfortunately, I persist in my overall pessimistic outlook for stocks, and for the economy in general. Friday’s rally essentially negated Thursday’s sell-off, but I don’t expect it to be the start of a sustained turnaround.

We’re getting a taste of that this morning, with the Dow opening down around 7%. 

This selloff is coming on the back of an emergency interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve of 100 basis points (to 0%-0.25%) on Sunday… along with the announcement of a new quantitative easing program of $700 billion. (I will write about this further over the next several days.)

As I have been writing for many weeks, the financial bubble – which the Fed created by pumping trillions of dollars into the financial system – has popped. It will take some time for the bubble to deflate to sustainable levels.

Today I’ll walk you through what’s going on in the markets and the economy… what I expect going forward and why… and what it means for us as traders. (You’ll see it’s not all bad news.)

## Coronavirus’ Strain on the Global Economy

To start, let’s put things in perspective: This asset deflation was coming one way or another. Covid19 (or coronavirus) has simply accelerated the process. 

Major retailers are closing, tourism is getting crushed, universities and schools are sending students home, conventions, sporting events, concerts, and other public gatherings have been cancelled, banks and other financial service firms are going largely virtual, and there has been a massive loss of wealth.

Restaurant data suggests that consumer demand is dropping sharply, and the global travel bans will only worsen the situation.

Commercial real estate is another sector that looks particularly vulnerable. We are almost certain to see a very sharp and pronounced economic slowdown here in the United States, and elsewhere. In fact, I expect a drop of at least 5% of GDP over the next two quarters, which is quite severe by any standard.

Sure, when this cycle is complete, there will be tremendous amounts of pent-up demand by consumers, but for the time being, the consumer is largely on the sidelines.

Of course, the problems aren’t just in the U.S. China’s numbers look awful. In fact, the government there may have to “massage” their numbers a bit to show a positive GDP in the first quarter. Europe’s numbers will also look dreadful, and South Korea’s economy has been hit badly.

All around the world, borders are being shut, all non-essential businesses are being closed, and people in multiple countries are facing a lockdown of historic proportions. The coronavirus is certainly having a powerful impact, and it looks certain that its impact will persist for a while.

Consider global tourism. It added almost $9 trillion to the global economy in 2018, and roughly 320 million jobs. This market is in serious trouble.

Fracking in the U.S. is another business sector that is in a desperate situation. Millions of jobs and tens of billions of loans are now in jeopardy.

The derivative businesses that this sector supports will be likewise devastated as companies are forced to reduce their workforces or shut down due to the collapse in oil prices. This sector’s suffering will probably force banks to book some big losses despite attempts by the government to support this industry.

In a similar way, the derivative businesses that are supported by the universities and colleges across America are going to really suffer.

There are nearly 20 million students in colleges across the U.S. When they go home for spring vacation and do not return, the effect on the local businesses that colleges and university populations support will be devastating.

What does this “new normal” mean going forward? Let’s take a look…

## New Normal

The new normal may become increasingly unpleasant for us. We need to be ready to hunker down for quite some time.

Beyond that, the government needs to handle this crisis far better in the future.

The level of stupidity associated with the massive throngs of people trapped in major airports yesterday, for example, was almost unimaginable.

Instead of facilitating the reduction of social contact and halting the further spread of the coronavirus, the management of the crowds at the airports produced a perfect breeding ground for the spread of the virus.

My guess is that more draconian travel restrictions will be implemented soon, matching to some extent the measures taken across Europe.

This will in turn have a further dampening effect on economic activity in the U.S., putting more and more pressure on the Fed and the government to artificially support a rapidly weakening economy.

Where does this end up? It is too early to say, but a very safe bet is that we will have some months of sharply negative growth. Too many sectors of the economy are going to take a hit to expect anything else.

The Fed has already driven interest rates to zero. Will that help? Unlikely. In fact, as I mentioned at the beginning of this update, the markets are voting with a resounding NO.

The businesses that are most affected by the current economic situation will still suffer. Quantitative easing is hardly a cure-all. In fact, it has been one of the reasons that we have such a mess in our markets today. 

The markets have become addicted to the easy money, so more of the same will have little or no impact. We will need real economic demand, not an easier monetary policy.

It won’t help support tourism, for example, or the other sectors getting smashed right now. The government will need to spend at least 5% of GDP, or roughly $1 trillion, to offset the weakness I see coming.

Is it surprising that the Fed and the government take emergency steps to try to stabilize economic growth? Not at all. This is essentially what they have been doing for a long time, so it is completely consistent with their playbook.

Next, I would anticipate the government implementing some massive public-works and infrastructure programs over the coming months. That would be very helpful, and almost certainly quite necessary.

But there’s a problem with this kind of intervention from the government…

## What Happens When You Eliminate the Business Cycle

The Fed’s foolish attempt to eliminate business cycles is a significant contributing factor to the volatility we are currently experiencing. 

Quantitative easing is nothing more than printing lots and lots of money to support a weak economy and give the appearance of growth and prosperity. In fact, it is a devaluation of the currency’s true buying power.

That in turn artificially drives up the prices of other assets, such as stocks, real estate and gold – but it does not create true wealth. That only comes with non-inflationary growth of goods and services and associated increases in economic output.

Inflation is the government’s way to keep people thinking they are doing better.

To that point: We have seen some traditional safe-haven assets getting destroyed during this time of risk aversion. That has certainly compounded the problems of many investors.

Gold is a great example. As the stock market got violently slammed, people were forced to come up with cash to support their losing positions. Gold became a short-term source of liquidity as people sold their gold holdings in somewhat dramatic fashion. It was one of the few holdings of many people that was not dramatically under water, so people sold it.

The move may have seemed perverse, particularly to people who bought gold as a safe-haven asset, but in times of crisis, all assets tend to become highly correlated, at least short term.

We saw a similar thing happen with long yen exposures and long Bitcoin exposures recently.

The dollar had its strongest one-day rally against the yen since November 2016 as people were forced to sell huge amounts of yen to generate liquidity. Many speculators had made some nice profits recently as the dollar dropped sharply from 112 to 101.30, but they have been forced to book whatever profits they had in this position. Again, this was due to massive losses elsewhere in their portfolios.

Is the yen’s sell-off complete? If it is not complete, it is probably at least close to an attractive level for Japanese investors to start buying yen against a basket of currencies. The major supplies of yen have largely been taken off the table for now.

For example, the yen had been a popular funding currency for “carry” plays. People were selling yen and buying higher-yielding currencies to earn the interest rate difference between the liability currency (yen) and the funding currency (for example, the U.S. dollar).

Carry plays are very unpopular in times of great uncertainty and volatility, however, so that supply of yen will be largely gone for quite some time. Plus, the yield advantage of currencies such as the U.S. dollar, Canadian dollar, and Australian dollar versus the yen is nearly gone.

In addition, at the end of the Japanese fiscal year , there is usually heavy demand for yen as Japanese corporations need to bring home a portion of their overseas holdings for balance sheet window dressing. I don’t expect that pressure to be different this year.

Just as the safe-haven assets of yen and gold got aggressively sold, Bitcoin also got hammered. It was driven by a similar theme – people had big losses and they needed to produce liquidity quickly. Selling Bitcoin became one of the sources of that liquidity.

## Heavy Price Deflation Ahead

Overall, there is a chance that this scenario turns into something truly ugly, with sustained price deflation across many parts of the economy. We will certainly have price deflation in many sectors, at least on a temporary basis.

Why does that matter over the long term?

Price deflation is the most debilitating economic development in a society that is debt-laden – like the U.S. today. Prices of assets come down… and the debt becomes progressively bigger and bigger.

The balance sheet of oil company Chesapeake Energy is a classic example. It’s carrying almost $10 *billion* worth of debt… versus a market cap of only about $600 *million*. Talk about leverage! When the company had a market cap of $10 billion, that debt level didn’t appear so terrifying.

Although this is an extreme example for illustrative purposes, the massive debt loads of China would seem more and more frightening if we were to sink into flat or negative growth cycles for a while. The government’s resources are already being strained, and it can artificially support only so many failing companies.

The U.S. has gigantic levels of debt as well, but it has the advantage of being the world’s true hegemon, and the U.S. dollar is the world’s reserve currency. This creates a tremendous amount of leverage and power in financing its debt.

The U.S. has been able to impose its will on its trading partners to trade major commodities in dollars. This has created a constant demand for the dollar that offsets, to a large extent, the massive trade deficit that the U.S. runs.

For example, if a German company wants to buy oil, then it needs to hold dollars. This creates a constant demand for dollar assets.

In short, the dollar’s status as the true global reserve currency is far more important than most people realize. China does not hold this advantage. 

## What to Do Now

In terms of how to position ourselves going forward, **I strongly recommend that people continue with a defensive attitude regarding stocks. There could be a lot more downside to come**. Likewise, we could see some panic selling in other asset classes.

**The best thing right now is to be liquid and patient, ready to pounce on special opportunities when they present themselves**.

For sure, there will be some exceptional opportunities, but it is too early to commit ourselves to just one industry. These opportunities could come in diverse sectors such as commercial real estate, hospitality, travel and leisure, and others.

As for the forex markets, the volatility in the currencies is extreme, so we are a bit cautious.

I still like the yen as a safe-haven asset. I likewise still want to sell the Australian dollar, the New Zealand dollar, and the Canadian dollar as liability currencies.

Why? The Bank of Canada, the Reserve Bank of Australia, and the Reserve Bank of New Zealand have all taken aggressive steps recently, slashing interest rates. These currencies are all weak, and they will get weaker.

Finding an ideal entry for a trade, however, is tricky. Therefore, we are being extra careful with our trading. We always prioritize the preservation of capital over generating profits, and we will continue with this premise.

At the same time, volatility in the markets is fantastic for traders. We expect many excellent opportunities to present themselves over the coming days and weeks as prices get driven to extreme levels and mispricings appear. So stay tuned.",finance

I'm constantly thinking about things I want - hobbies I have, hobbies I want to have, things I need for the house, whatever.

I'm frustrated though because I just can't get myself to stop wanting to spend money.

personalfinance,Conflicted: save more than recommended for emergencies or put $ toward debt,"Hi PF,

I’m having an internal debate with myself. Should I put more in my emergency fund or continue with my goals of paying off debt? 

Here’s my situation:
- 5mos saved for emergencies &amp; I will have 6 months by end of April. 
- 7k in student loan debt (3 loans @ 3.4%, 3.4%, &amp; 4.6%)
- $10k in auto loan debt at 3.24%.


Before any signs of recession, I planned on fully funding efund, maxing out Roth IRA, paying off highest interest rate debt (~$2k), &amp; almost maxing out my HSA. 

Now that it appears a recession is looming, I’m considering:
- putting more towards my emergency fund to get it to 9 mos of expenses OR
- putting more towards the auto loan since interest rates on federal student loans are now 0%. 

Regardless of what I choose, I still plan to max out Roth IRA. 

Does it make sense to save more than the recommended amount for emergencies amount in my situation? I tend to get anxious about being without.

Norwegian companies have already announced thousands of temporary lay-offs. It’s now clear those measures are quickly feeding through to economic data, providing a glimpse of what the rest of Europe may be facing, and putting pressure on the central bank to deliver more emergency interest rate cuts.

Norway’s reliance on oil exports has left it fighting an economic crisis on two fronts, **and its 5.3% registered unemployment rate is already the highest since 1995**, compared to monthly data, according to official figures published on Tuesday.

To keep up with the crisis, jobless data will now be published every week, and the Norwegian Labour and Welfare Administration expects the rate to keep rising, it said. Norway’s 1993 unemployment record of 6.3% may be crushed after lay-off benefits applications this week almost reached the total number in 2009, when the financial crisis was wreaking havoc.

“This data should be very worrisome for Norges Bank,” which as recently as last week only factored in a slight increase in unemployment through June, SEB Chief Strategist Erica Blomgren Dalsto said. “A further rate cut by at least 50bps is likely in the near-term.”

Questions:

Can you confirm the max we can contribute towards retirement each year ($57k) and whether that includes employer match (believe yes)?  Does their pension count towards the maximum annual contribution limit?

Assuming that their pension does not count we are already contributing about $52k so there is a small amount available for an IRA. Are we eligible for a ROTH IRA or is our household income disqualify us?

Is there a safeguard to keep us from going over the the total annual limit?  Feel like I’ve heard there is a penalty for contributing more to your 401(k) than is allowed.  Feds have the option of contributing a specific amount so that makes it easy, but I can only plan by a percent so have to keep playing with the amount throughout the year (was $4 below the limit last year).

personalfinance,Can't afford car payments and retirement contributions. How to pay off new car quickly?,"Throwaway because people know my main account.

Six months ago, my wife (34) and I (33) bought a brand-new 2019 Toyota Camry Hybrid. I love this car, we could afford it, and it fit our needs at the time. It became my commuter car for going to and from my job.

About a month ago, our family car (a 2011 Chevy Traverse) needed $6k in repair, far more than the car was worth (or that we could afford). My wife and I decided that it was not worth it to repair the car, and went shopping for a new one.

Stupidly, we bought a *brand new* one: a 2020 Chevy Traverse. We have excellent credit, and our interest rate is pretty good (3.5%), but the loan term (75 months) is not.

The problem is, we are discovering that our monthly budgets cannot really handle these new expenses. We had to adjust our budgets so that we are no longer contributing to our retirement fund in order to be able to pay our $1000/month (for both cars combined) car payments. 

We are not going into debt because of these payments, nor am I in danger of losing my job (well-established at my company in a high-demand field).

My Traditional IRA is with Vanguard, currently $40k in there. I do not have other retirement accounts at the moment.

Obviously, this is not ideal. We are searching for ways to help pay off one of the car payments (probably the Camry) more quickly so that we can resume contributing to retirement. We have three solutions:

1. Scrounge every extra dollar and throw it at the Camry loan. This will work, but not quickly. I think we'd, at best, shave a year off the end (i.e. finish paying the loan in 4.5 years).
2. Withdraw from the IRA to pay for the car. With the 10% tax on doing this, I don't like this idea very much.
3. Take out a home equity loan (we have significant equity in our house) and pay off one or both cars in one lump sum. But then we just add more debt at a worse interest rate for a longer time.
4. Either I try to find a higher-paying job (which I'd rather not because I enjoy my current company and feel valued here) or my wife tries to find a job (which puts pressure on her because she'd rather be home with our three kids). Both of these seem crazy to do because of a car, but then again, we were crazy to buy it in the first place.

Is there some route we should take that would be the best financial decision? Is there some solution we haven't thought of? Any advice (short of ""well you're stupid"" or ""just abandon the car"") is welcome.

TL;DR: Stupidly bought two new cars in six months, can't afford payments on both AND contribute to retirement, what now?",finance

investing,Some perspective on the Oil War,"Regarding Russia and Saudi Arabia.

The break even price isn't the whole story. For Russia and Saudi Arabia the cost of extraction alone is low (\~$3-4 ) but the problem is the price needed to balance their budgets and maintain a pegged currency.

Saudi Arabia:- Currency pegged at 3.75 Riyal / USD. As exports and other inflows drop, the current account balance turns negative, forex reserves (\~$500 billion) have to be spent (USD sold) in order to support this rate.- Oil makes up about 85% of the budget revenue. The budget balances at around $80 per barrel, this means debt has to be issued or sovereign wealth fund/reserve assets sold. (\~$600-700 billion)

Russia:- Russian rouble is free float, so as exports drop, so do imports as they become too expensive. This is opposite of Saudi Case where export flows decrease but imports remain attractive due to currency peg. Therefore forex reserves do not have to be spent (\~$550 billion).

\- Oil and gas make up about 40% of the budget revenue. The Russian Federal budget is based on 2800 roubles/barrel and the rouble is currently trading at 75 to the dollar, to balance at $30 per barrel the currency would have to depreciate to around 90, there are a few reasons it hasn't done so already (OFZ, other inflows)  There is a sovereign wealth fund that can be tapped into as well (\~$100 billion).

The biggest difference is Saudi Arabia has a lot more spare capacity than Russia. The Saudis could pump out an additional 1-2 million barrels, while Russia can do maybe 0.3-0.5. They can inflict more pain, but not sure if they can weather the storm.

I was told that my child's W-2 wages would be reporting on our (Mom and Dad) taxes and we would pay any additional taxes that are owed on it (in California -- Federal and/or State).

I don't remember this when I was a child with a job living in CA, but I guess I could have been wrong.  Does this sound right?

(I will be consulting my CPA for this but am trying to figure this out in advance and am not looking for any legally binding guidance here).

personalfinance,Beginner to Balance Transfers,"A couple days ago, I had a family emergency and had to use a large amount of my credit card balance to help pay the costs of the hospital. Well my deadline is coming up and I just don’t have the money to pay it. 

This is my first credit card and I’ve been trying not to use too much, only to build my credit. However with this balance, my credit is sure to go down!

I got a letter in the mail from a different credit company(Discover) telling new about a card for students(I’m in university). So I researched whether u could move my balance from my current card to a new card with lower interest rate. Then I came across Balance Transfers. I can’t seem to understand it well but I think I can transfer my balance from a higher interest rate card to a lower one. Would it be possible to do balance transfers to card from different companies, and is this a good idea until I can repay a chunk at a time for my current debt. The interest rate is a taking a big bite out of my savings

Sorry if I’m asking dumb questions, I’m fairly new to credit and I’ve only had this card for about 2 years.",finance
personalfinance,TurboTax versus FreeTaxUSA: my brief personal experience and thoughts,"My wife and I filed jointly for the first time. I took her laptop and mine, and went tax form by tax form through both sites. When I got to the end, I had a federal refund difference of $5, and a total refund difference of $7. When it came time to pay, however, FreeTaxUSA was $12.95 for state, while TurboTax would not let me file without paying $40 for federal and additional for state.

TurboTax has a bit more automation involved and appears to be more user-friendly, but obviously you pay more for it. FreeTaxUSA was pretty solid too. My biggest problem between the two came from my Robinhood document. TurboTax allowed me to upload the Robinhood document (or enter some info and it pulled the information for me, I forget).

TurboTax didn’t give me any problems after the upload, while FreeTaxUSA informed me I would need to mail my Robinhood statement, along with my tax refund summary, to the IRS due to the wash sale amount. I didn’t fully understand this part, but it tells me the same thing on the “view status and print your copy” page: Mail form 8453 to the IRS with your summary statement attached showing the individual stock or investment sales you summarized. I didn’t have to do this using TurboTax for 2018, so I am assuming this is due to the TurboTax/Robinhood partnership.

From my experience, unless I can file for free (except paying for state) on TurboTax, I will be using FreeTaxUSA in the future. Otherwise, I would easily pick TurboTax, as their platform is much easier to understand and follow.",finance
personalfinance,Financial Tips in Light of our Current Environment,"1. **Don't Panic** \- **Take the long term approach**.   Market volatility is normal and a correction has been expected for some time now. It simply needed a catalyst and boy did we get that catalyst.  It's critical to remember that you don't lose money in the market until you sell. The current drop seems extreme in the short term, but if you take a step back and look at the market overall, *it always goes up*. People have been claiming that ""this time it's different"" for over a hundred years but time after time, the market continues its relentless march upwards. I'll illustrate it with a few high/lows of the S&amp;P 500 compared to last night's market close of 2,386

**1 Year Ago - 2,822**

**5 Years Ago - 2,108**

**10 Years Ago - 1,159**

If you do an image search of the S&amp;P 500 over the past 100 years, you'll see this is just a blip in the long run. This 30% drop represents a high from just a few years ago. If you're retirement horizon is at 5-10 years away, drops like this actually benefit you as it allows you to purchase stocks ""on sale"". So when it comes to your 401(k) and if your retirement is still decades away, crashes today benefit you in the long run. Keep on investing and over time, your balance will compound even faster as the market recovers. Remember, time in the market beats timing the market. No one knows if we're at the bottom or if it will continue to drop and those who claim they do, [don't know what they're talking about](https://www.ifa.com/articles/spiva_-year_2019_active_passive_scorecard/). So pulling all of your money right now and then promptly seeing a recovery would mean selling at a loss and at the market bottom. Alternatively, pulling all your money right now and promptly seeing more of a drop might make you feel smarter than everyone else, but then when do you get back in? If 90%+ of fund managers [can't beat the market](https://www.aei.org/carpe-diem/more-evidence-that-its-really-hard-to-beat-the-market-over-time-95-of-finance-professionals-cant-do-it/), chances are you can't either. So personally, I will continue to invest in the market (via low cost index funds). If your retirement horizon is just around the corner, my suggestions would be different when it comes to fund allocation but to prevent an even longer post, I'll defer this for the time being.

2) **Live below your means.** Ideally, our fixed expenses should be well below our salaries. With economic uncertainty, it's always a good idea to have a buffer to weather any storms that may come up. I'm all for supporting small businesses during this time but if this is at the cost of your fiscal security, it's wise to step back and rein in spending. There are a lot of good resources out there on how to do this for every possible expense category.

3) **Consider refinancing - but don't rush**. The fed slashed interest rates to zero meaning borrowing money is about as cheap as it possibly gets. They do this to stimulate economic growth and this tends to trickle down to the consumer. As such, now is a great time to consider refinancing a mortgage if the interest savings offset the closing costs. Some refis are getting rates as low as 2.75%! That said, lenders are inundated with refinance requests so you might have to wait a bit. But it's highly likely these rates stay around 0% for at least the rest of the year so you don't need to rush.

4) **Be generous.** Layoffs are starting to happen across the nation. It's important that you have a buffer in place to protect you from anything life might throw your way. A few months of expenses saved up is a great way to feel at ease during economic uncertainty. But after you've created some security for yourself, focus your gaze outwards. A lot of people don't have savings and most Americans are one missed paycheck away from financial ruin so let's do what we can to make sure this happens to as few people as possible. Order takeout or delivery from local merchants, leave large tips, *buy gift cards,* check in with elderly neighbors and family and see if you can do shopping/prescription runs. Check in with local churches/non profits to see if they have a working list of items that can be donated to help those who couldn't get to toilet paper/diapers/wipes/feminine products in time. Do what you can to help your fellow man and don't live in fear.

personalfinance,401(k) Loan given current conditions?,"Long story short I was planning to take a large, but not maximized, loan from my 401(k) and was in the process of verifying bank accounts and finalizing paperwork when the shit hit the fan.  I chose this option because I could do it at a reasonable interest rate that was paid to me, rather than a bank, the payback period was short enough as to only have an estimated $12k impact to my account over the timeline to retirement and the terms of the loan structure are low risk.

As of right now, I still have room to take the full amount of the loan from my 401(k) and cover the various things I had intended to consolidate.  But given that we're far from settled, if the market continues down I may not be able to cover in full.

I'm looking for input on whether this is still the best decision, or if I should consider alternative options (and what those options might be).  Full details below, happy to add if you need more details.

**Me**:  Early 30s, stable job and career with growth potential, homeowner, car paid off, getting back on track after careless financial behavior in my early and mid 20s.

**Job**: SaaS Account Manager, on growth track, take on and execute additional projects and responsibilities as available. $90k salary, no additional compensation.

**401(k)**: Contributing 10%, employer match is 50% up to 6%, not yet fully vested.  Was $85k balance, is now \~$62k due to relatively aggressive allocation given 30+ years to retirement.  Available amount does not include un-vested matching funds.

**Debt**: \~$30k across several credit and personal loan lines.  Have done a decent job of bouncing amounts across 0% balance transfer offers to pay an effective interest rate of 3-4% rather than the 16%+ rates.  Got tired of making no progress and want to be on a 3-4 year path to $0.

**Budget**: $1200/mo available to pay down, via whichever method.  Really liked the idea of a single direct-debit to the 401(k) to reduce my monthly paycheck and eliminate multiple individual debt payments.  Essentially out of sight, out of mind and living on $75k/yr.

**Loan Terms**: 5.75% interest rate, \~$500 origination fees, monthly payback permitted in the event of job loss (no danger of having to pay the balance in full), no one-time payments permitted (only payment in full), no early payoff penalties, term of up to 60 months, only one loan permitted outstanding at a time.

**Alternatives:** Debt consolidation loan for full amount; partial low-$ 401(k) loan for highest interest and continuing the 0% BT juggle for the remainder to weather the dip and possible recession;  continue the maintenance payments until the markets recover; continue as is and keep an eye out for COVID-related forgiveness plans or reduced rates.",finance

Bitcoin,Another way to make (small) crypto purchases during the dip,"Not sure how many people are using CoinPayments for their payment/wallet needs, but they seem to have added a new feature.

One thing to keep in mind is that most credit cards treat crypto purchases the same as cash advances, meaning that your interest rate is going to kick in at the time of purchase. If you decide to give it a shot, it's a good idea to pay off the debt immediately.

What I didn't realize was the new W4 was in place and I couldn't just modify the Married value to Single without redoing the entire form.  I got a 3% raise for this year and I didn't notice anything had changed until my latest check, with the 3% raise, was down noticeably from my previous paycheck.

This past year I was close to $0 for federal/state return, which I understand (and agree) is where you want to be.  How do I get back to there?  I understand there is no more W4 with 0/1/2/etc. exceptions and you're supposed to pick an amount.  Does that mean I'd also need to redo this form every time I got a pay increase or decrease instead of the previous form working for as long as you didn't want to change your excemptions?

I've tried this site: https://apps.irs.gov/app/tax-withholding-estimator/  I've tried just doing the math based on the tax brackets and determining how much I'd pay.  I'd tried just adding 3% to the previous amount I was being taxed at.  Every place is a wildly different number.  The highest one is doing it based on brackets, but I assume that's because there are no other deductions or credits in there.  The website is the next highest.     And then adding 3% to my previous amount is the lowest.

What's the best way to determine how to fill out the new W4?  I asked my employer if they could just scrap the change I made to go back to the old one and they said no, I'd have to figure it out from here.  They said I should get a tax consultant, which is insane to think everyone would need to do that to determine how much to have taken out.


Edit: A couple points I missed.

- I filed Head of Household in 2019

- I did not take out the standard deduction in my calculations when doing the brackets, but it won't move me down another bracket anyhow.

- I claim one child plus associated daycare expenses (~$12,000/yr)

How about now with the recent announcement that federal student loan interest will be suspended?,"The recent announcement that federal student loan interest would be suspended for some time made me start to think, would it ever (now?) be a good time to prioritize my student loan repayment over credit card debt repayment? Any insight would be appreciated.

Here is a chunked-out summary of my situation:

\-I have several thousand in both federal student loans (""FSLs"") and credit card debt (""CCD""). Amounts are significant but manageable.

\-My budget is very much under control and both balances are only going down. Though I haven't always made the best financial decisions, this debt was largely racked up by going back to grad school and I am well into my post-grad school career.

\-I have multiple credit cards and I've been able to transfer my CCD across transfer offers on my current cards annually for a long time now. As a result my effective interest rate on my CCD is about 4%.

\-My FSLs (I have not refinanced them) average out to about 6.2% interest. 

\-My income is slowly growing (public service job, but I don't believe that my debt amount makes PSLF viable) but it is low enough right now that I get the full interest rebate on my taxes, so my effective interest rate on my FSLs is maybe in the 5% range. Either way, it is mathematically higher than my CCDs interest right now.

\-With the percentage of my income that I am able to devote to debt payments, I have some extra left over after minimums, and I have always used that for my CCD. I have done this based on what I felt was conventional wisdom that credit debt was more important to prioritize over student debt and the fear that balance transfer offers could dry up at some point, leaving me with an APR of 15% or more on my CCD.

Essentially, I'm asking if I should stay the course (pay minimums on all, and concentrate debt payment beyond minimums on credit debt first and student debt after) or try something else (focus on federal student loan repayment)?

...Special Update

This week has gotten off to a wild start. On Monday we had the largest one-day decline in the stock market since the crash of 1987. At the close of trading, the S&amp;P 500 was down over 27% for the year, and the Dow Jones was down over 30% for the year. The Fed’s panic interest rate cut on Sunday, coupled with its enormous funding commitment, did little to stem the massive waves of selling of stocks, gold, and other assets. Trillions of dollars have been lost, and the prospects for the economy over the next several quarters look abysmal.  

On Tuesday, the markets are bouncing back, with the stock markets up about 5% at the time of my writing. Nevertheless, my overall views on the economy remain unchanged: we are currently in a global recession. With major portions of the world’s population trapped inside their homes, many sectors of the economy are getting hit very, very hard. This won’t change anytime soon. Travel, leisure, entertainment, retail, dining, energy, and commercial real estate are among the sectors that are getting smashed by the Coronavirus. We are in the early stages of an unprecedented demand shock.  

Wherever I look, I see economic hemorrhaging. In China, the Coronavirus brought industrial production to a near stand-still, and now the country is going through a secondary shock due to the lack of consumer purchases – both domestically and abroad. Their first quarter GDP is going to come in around minus 11%, a truly staggering drop from their typical high single digit growth rate.

Europe is hunkering down, with nearly war-like conditions across the continent. People have been instructed to stay at home except for emergencies. Economic activity is collapsing. In fact, Europe has just shut down its borders to travel, so economic activity will slow even further.

I could carry on, but the point should be clear. In countries across the globe, economic activity is slowing – FAST. It will get much worse before it gets better. In a worst-case scenario, we are looking at a global depression. In a best-case scenario, we will have two horrendous quarters of negative growth. As the data starts to roll in, we will be able to fine-tune just how ugly this scenario is becoming.

This is unlike prior shocks to our system. The Fed providing liquidity will not solve the problem. It may stabilize the stock market temporarily, but it will hardly create the economic demand which the U.S. needs in order to recover. While people are trapped in their homes, consumption will remain extremely weak. Retailers need to shutter their stores and hope for government bailouts. Airline executives, hotel groups, and oil executives will likewise be looking for handouts. For example, Boeing shares are down nearly 70% over the past six months. They employ hundreds of thousands of people, and they need help.

The government is floating the idea of a $1.2 trillion fiscal package. It is being presented as a business interruption funding. The funding would be a mix of handouts to individuals and loans to various companies. Will that be enough? Let’s see if the lawmakers can agree on the implementation of such major fiscal stimulus package. 

At the same time, with the Fed having pushed interest rates down towards 0%, many of the tools of the central banks have been used up. The idea of the Fed printing money and buying debt assets is ok as an emergency procedure when the capital markets are seizing due to a loss of liquidity. That is not what we have going on right now. It is also not ok as a standard operating procedure when the economy is not in a state of crisis. Unfortunately, this is exactly what the Fed has done since 2008. Our economy must be weaned off of this artificial life support.

Credit spreads have widened, but the demand shock of 2020 is far different from the crisis of 2008, when the banking system was under extreme stress and in danger of collapsing. It is a strategy that is ill-suited for the current problem. When the government gives the banks free money, then the banks should give their clients free money. That didn’t happen in 2008/2009 and it won’t happen now. The banks will hold on to whatever funding they receive in order to prop up their balance sheets. Already the banks are going to their private equity clients to try to convince them to provide funding for the banks’ corporate customers. Their behavior is not going to change anytime soon.

The immediate problem is the reality that hundreds of thousands – or millions – of people will shortly be out of work for two or three months – maybe longer. Payroll tax assistance provides no help to unemployed people. We need to get money in the pockets of these people so that they can eat.  

With the U.S. facing such severe problems, why is the dollar so strong against most major currencies?  First, it makes sense that the Australian dollar and Canadian dollar are weak. Their economies are heavily commodity-based, and commodity prices have plummeted. European economic data is awful and getting worse, so weakness in the euro and British pound also makes sense. The other issue is that funding spreads have widened except for the very best credits, and this is creating a de facto dollar shortage. The dollar shortage is in turn leading to panic dollar buying.  

One thing that I have not heard mainstream media focus on is the negative wealth effect that the stock market sell-off is going to create here in the U.S., and elsewhere. The loss of $11 trillion of shareholder value over the recent weeks will certainly have a dampening effect on consumer confidence and consumer spending.  This will likely exacerbate the demand shock which the Coronavirus is producing.",finance

Two weeks ago, I locked in a 30 year mortgage with a fixed interest rate at 2.8%. My mortgage lender said I got extremely lucky as within a week of locking in my rate, mortgage lenders in general were getting an influx of requests for refinancing/mortgage lending that they bumped the rate back up (temporarily or permanently, didn’t ask that far) to curb the volume of requests. 

With the Feds cutting the interest rates to 0%, 1) does this affect individual consumers like myself and 2) should I unlock my locked rate in hopes that it’d get even lower?

They are not only at risk from the spread of the virus itself but also from the responses of the government, both local and national.

Homeless communities are highly social environments. Many encampments around the country are home to hundreds of people living in close quarters. Unlike formal residences, these informal settlements lack appropriate access to sanitation services. Running water, toilets, and even soap are not easily accessible to homeless people. [Public health officials are calling for social distancing and limited gatherings to slow the spread of the virus](https://www.newsweek.com/dr-anthony-fauci-says-he-would-like-dramatic-reduction-personal-interactions-social-1492410), but the reality is that many people are totally unable to do these things. This is all the more true for the homeless.

While the national response to the Coronavirus pandemic has been [slow](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/03/03/coronavirus-flawed-cdc-testing-kits-slowed-us-results/4930932002/) and [ineffective](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/political-commentary/trump-coronavirus-response-fail-959868/), state and local efforts to combat the virus have also been problem-ridden. Such efforts are still far short of the seriousness of the crisis. Governments of the SF Bay Area have created [some local ordinances](https://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2020/02/26/coronavirus-san-francisco-emergency-mayor-london-breed/) to address the crisis. The City of Berkeley has placed [some hand washing stations at its largest encampments](https://www.berkeleyside.com/2020/03/13/berkeley-sets-up-22-hand-washing-stations-to-help-the-homeless-and-others-from-getting-coronavirus). Berkeley has even [leased land](https://www.berkeleyside.com/2020/02/26/mayor-wants-to-turn-homeless-camp-near-seabreeze-market-into-official-outdoor-shelter) to one homeless community, known as the “Seabreeze” community in West Berkeley, temporarily shielding them from further displacement and earmarking the community for expanded city services. However, these are mere pittances which do next to nothing to protect the homeless from this virus.

In 2018, Leila Farha, the UN Special Rapporteur for Adequate Housing, visited San Francisco and was horrified by the conditions for the homeless. Noting how homeless people are denied basic access to water, toilets, and sanitation she said, [“The idea that a government would deny people those services …when they have nowhere else to go suggests a kind of cruelty that is unsurpassed.""](https://www.businessinsider.com/un-expert-san-francisco-homeless-cruelty-2018-11) Last year, an investigation by the New York Times concluded that the conditions for the homeless in Oakland were [comparable to or worse than the conditions in the slums of Mexico City](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/12/17/us/oakland-california-homeless-camp.html). In normal times, the homeless in the U.S. live in extremely precarious conditions, and face constant evictions and harassment from the government.

During this epidemic, the homeless will be particularly hard hit. Studies have found that with the exception of obesity, strokes, and cancer, [the homeless are far more likely to suffer from every category of chronic health problem.](http://www.nationalhomeless.org/publications/facts/Health.pdf) This includes diseases like diabetes, asthma, and heart disease, [which all increase the likelihood of dying from Coronavirus](https://www.freep.com/story/news/health/2020/03/09/coronavirus-covid-asthma-diabetes-cancer/4962424002/). Given this situation, some minor improvements to sanitation like handwashing stations are unlikely to do much to deter the spread of Coronavirus among the homeless, especially given that recent studies have shown that [the virus has a significant ability to spread via airborne transmission](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/science/article/3074351/coronavirus-can-travel-twice-far-official-safe-distance-and-stay).

What’s more, given the history of abuse and oppression heaped on the homeless, it is likely that during this crisis they will be treated as potential vectors for the virus that endanger the rest of the population. Instead of the government working to provide them with housing and medical care, the homeless could be rounded up and treated as a public safety risk. Historically, the U.S. government has left many poor people to die during disasters. For example, during Hurricane Katrina, [thousands of poor, most black residents of New Orleans’ Ninth Ward were left to fend for themselves](https://www.democracynow.org/2005/9/5/survivors_from_new_orleans_speak_out) while the government focused evacuation and relief efforts on wealthy communities. When the government finally did offer assistance, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) housed around [30,0000 people in the Superdome, a sports stadium without proper plumbing, food, or supplies](https://ftw.usatoday.com/2015/08/refuge-of-last-resort-five-days-inside-the-superdome-for-hurricane-katrina).

Residents in one of Oakland's largest encampments are well aware of this disturbing possibility. When asked how they felt about the situation, one resident of this encampment said, “they \[local officials\] have told us nothing, they could come and put us in FEMA camps.” This fear reflects the experiences of many homeless people, who already regularly have to deal with [violent assaults](https://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/violence-redefined-nyc-homeless-shelters-keeping-stats-article-1.3826801), [overcrowding](https://www.homelesshub.ca/resource/shelters-are-overcrowded-more-housing-needed-homeless-northwest-territories), and [poor health conditions](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/homeless-shelter-parents_b_1035952) in the existing shelter system. It’s not unreasonable to assume that during a crisis, they would be treated even worse by a system that already considers them disposable.

In the current crisis we can see the brutal way the state and national authorities treat people in general. A recent case where this came out was the management of a Coronavirus outbreak on the Grand Princess cruise liner. The cruise ship was off the coast of San Francisco, en-route from Mexico to the U.S., when it reported probable cases of Covid-19 onboard. [The boat was then in limbo for several days](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-diary-of-a-grand-princess-crew-member-as-covid-19-spread-on-the-ship), while president [Trump worried about whether letting the passengers debark from the ship would raise the U.S. number of Coronavirus cases and make him look bad](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-keep-passengers-on-grand-princess-cruise-ship-coronavirus-2020-3?op=1). Eventually he agreed to let the passengers get off in Oakland, but at that point the virus had been spreading on the ship for days and days, certainly infecting more of the passengers and the crew.

A[lmost 3000 people disembarked from the vessel over three days, and the US residents aboard were shuttled to nearby military bases to be quarantined](https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/cruises/2020/03/16/coronavirus-grand-princess-departs-oakland-lets-off-crew/5058788002/). People in this situation were given little information on how long they will be detained, and many reported [dwindling food in the days leading up to their disembarking the vessel](https://www.foxnews.com/travel/cruise-ship-guests-food-grand-princess-claims).

Negligent and authoritarian responses like this will only become more common as the situation intensifies. Furthermore, state and federal agencies are under more pressure to “do more.” Homeless people are some of the most vulnerable in our society. Both authoritarian crackdowns and a lack of action to protect the homeless will impact them even more. Given the response we have seen to Coronavirus so far, it seems likely that the state will mismanage this situation as well, putting many at risk through a mix of negligence and repressive measures.

stocks,A deep dive at the Fed's new Credit Facility,"So the Fed has announced their new bazooka, asset purchase program which is Quantitative Easing on steroids.

What  many people don't understand in Repo is that this was not a liquidity  issue, there are plenty of excess reserves, infact over $1trillion. The  problem was CRAP collateral, so in the Feds new program, they have  opened up the door to pretty much any collateral, even Fucking Muni  Bonds. Stocks are also in this group

\&gt;  Eligible Collateral•Collateral eligible for pledge under the PDCF  includes all collateral eligible for pledge in open market operations  (OMO);1 plus investment grade corporate debt securities, international  agency securities, commercial paper, **municipal securities**, mortgage-backed securities, and **asset-backed securities;** plus equity securities

Why  is this important??? What this essentially does, is if someone needs  cash, instead of selling their stock asset on the open market, pushing  down prices for that stock, they will simply transfer that stock to the  Federal Reserve who will grossly overpay for that stock (just like they  did for Mortgage backed Securities post-GFC). This is an effort to put a  floor on asset prices, because we cannot price discover in the Fed's  brave new world. It is basically to get crappy collateral/assets off the  balance sheet of the Banks, this is a BANK bailout first, and a bailout  for borrowers next.

The  next point is that these are suppose to be temporary, for 90 days only,  but as we all saw that once the market gets these, there is no putting  the genie back in the bottle, just like during Quantitative tightening  the market cannot survive.

personalfinance,"I have $22,000 coming my way from a side hustle - full time job still seems stable. Where should I put my money?","Is this a good plan?

I have been waiting on 3 large checks totaling almost $22,000 for a side hustle I did a few months ago and ***WAS*** going to use it to pay off all my credit card debt \~$10k @ 10-12% interest and part of my federal student loan. ($21k at 4.5%-6.5% interest). So far I have received the first check of $8,000 and it's just sitting in my checking account staring at me right now. I also should be getting around $6,000 back on my federal tax refund, not sure about California though but maybe around $3,000? So All in all I have close to $30,000 headed my way.

My original plan was to pay off those debts which would free up about $1200 in monthly cash flow (since I'd no longer have those debt payments) and then start aggressively saving $3,300k/month for a house down payment. I live in Los Angeles and was hoping to buy a home in the next 2-3 years.

***HOWEVER*** due to the pending apocalypse I’m now very glad my check has taken forever to arrive so I didn't go forward with that original plan. I'm now wondering if I should instead keep the cash liquid or put it in a high interest savings account for now. I've already put my student loans in forebearance until August as Trump froze student loan interest indefinitely during this crisis, so I can focus on paying off my higher interest credit cards during this time of 0 student loan interest. So I could theoretically put that  $3300/month toward my credit cards and have them paid off in \~3 months.

I make around $5800/month after tax (claiming 0) and I have worked hard to get my monthly living expenses down to around $2500/month. Right now my job seems to be pretty stable, but just in case something dire happens, having that $22,000 liquid sounds like a better plan right now, no? I will also be getting a yearly cost of living raise in July at 3%. And another raise in November that will up my hourly another $1.67.

***But*** I also hate the idea of not capitalizing on the temporary market crash. Should I max out my 2019 Roth with $6000? Or do something else with the money? I would still have $16,000 left liquid which is more than enough to keep me afloat for 6 months if something really bad happened.

At this rate - I could have $32,500 saved by the end of the year and All of my credit card debt paid off. I would REALLY love to capitalize on a housing crash in LA if it does happen here. Especially while interest rates are low.",finance

Bond yields are rising / prices are falling. I'm finding this a bit spooky - it seems to go against the common wisdom of bonds protecting your portfolio when stocks do badly, and it also seems counter to the recent lowering of interest rates by many central banks. So far it seems to be mostly about Europe, but it's happening to US bonds as well.

What are people worried about - inflation? Governments defaulting? If this is due to worries about inflation it seems like there really aren't any proper safe havens left right now (well, maybe gold).

Forex,USD fundamentals and current environment,"Hi all,

I'm trying to get my head around one thing - if US markets are currently dumping (one of the worst declines in history), how is that the USD is actually gaining strength against currencies like GBP, EUR or JPY?

I would have thought that declining stock market suggest weakening of the economy, hence the US dollar value should be dropping as well, as the currency strength should be correlated to the country's economical strength?

Also, given current events surrounding it all, I would have thought the following would be happening:

\- fed injected billions (a trillion?) dollars to save the economy. They did so by buying bonds

\- buying bonds would increase their price due to higher demand

\- higher bond prices decrease yields on those bonds

\- decreased bond yields weaken the currency - foreign investors are not keen on pouring their money into lower yielding assets

\- as such, the USD \*should\* technically start declining against other major currencies

Why the opposite is happening? Does anyone have any logical explanation or is my understanding lacking a significant factor?",finance
Bitcoin,"That's right, the correlation between Bitcoin and U.S. stocks is hitting a record high","On March 12, due to the panic caused by the rapid spread of New Coronary Pneumonia, the price of bitcoin fell sharply on a single day, and the rest of the cryptocurrencies generally followed suit. Most cryptocurrencies fell more than 30% weekly.

[Source: Coin Metrics Reference Rates](https://preview.redd.it/ykvu5ske8fn41.png?width=800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3eb7c26d817c3246f948e02b05dd497eb0774b6a)

The latest Coinmetrics report analyzes the reasons for the crash, specifically pointing out that the correlation between Bitcoin and S &amp; P hit a record high. At the same time, data shows that short-term investors have promoted the large-scale selling of cryptocurrencies.

&amp;#x200B;

相关 BTC and S &amp; P correlation reach record high

&amp;#x200B;

历史 BTC's historic one-day price decline coincided with the worst day in the US stock market since 1987. On March 12, the Pearson correlation coefficient between BTC and the S &amp; P 500 soared to an all-time high of 0.52, the previous record high of 0.32. This shows that the crypto asset market is increasingly connected to existing traditional markets and is more sensitive to external events than ever before.

[Source: Coin Metrics Reference Rates](https://preview.redd.it/25xmd7mj8fn41.png?width=800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c581d8302e8b60b70fc11715c777a3f1c1995082)

Over the past week, the bitcoin price has responded to several key events, including President Trump's announcement of a 30-day travel ban between the United States and Europe, and the Federal Reserve's announcement to reduce the federal benchmark interest rate to 0.00% -0.25% Levels and more. Below is a comparison of the timing of some key events over the past week with the price of Bitcoin.

&amp;#x200B;

BTC sellers seem to be mainly short-term holders

&amp;#x200B;

According to the data on the blockchain, the recent sell-off of bitcoin transactions has mostly come from relatively short-term traders and recent entry holders. At least so far, long-term holders remain bullish.

&amp;#x200B;

MeCoin Metrics' Supply Activation Index tracks how many coins that have not moved during a particular period of time re-enter circulation. On March 11, approximately 281k bitcoins that had not been moved within 30 days re-entered circulation, while only 4,131 bitcoins that did not move within one year entered circulation. This shows that the two-day trend on March 11 and March 12 involved bitcoin with little one-year long-term holders.

https://preview.redd.it/3nh814wr8fn41.png?width=700&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e57322372ebb70f1607c3beb26a832d42e9fcbf0

March 11 is the fourth largest peak in the number of unremoved bitcoins in the past eight years and 30 days.

https://preview.redd.it/pqdyx40v8fn41.png?width=700&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0961fe5006aff0f9dbc83875fbdd5d113674ab2f

Long-term holders have not wavered, and the number of Bitcoins that have not moved and re-entered into circulation during the one-year period has not increased abnormally.

[BTC MVRV index drops below 1](https://preview.redd.it/vsyi41oy8fn41.png?width=700&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=37aadaeb9164832d4470b9e953193003d5df767b)

MVRV above 1 indicates that speculators value the market higher than holders, and MVRV below 1 indicates that holders value the market higher than current speculators. When the MVRV is lower than 1, it is not so easy for the holder to immediately sell for a profit.

&amp;#x200B;

MVOn March 12, the MVRV index fell to 0.5, the largest one-day drop since December 2013. It turns out that the period when the MVRV index fell below 1 in the past is also the best time to buy more Bitcoin at a discounted price.

to sum up

&amp;#x200B;

MetricCoinmetrics finally concluded that after a crazy sell-off in the past week or so, although the price of bitcoin has fallen sharply, multiple figures are reassuring. The sell-off seems to be mainly caused by short-term investors stepping on fear, and long-term holders have so far been relatively stable. At the same time, as Bitcoin MVRV dropped below 1, it seems to have entered the historically attractive price-sucking range.",cryptocurrency

Bitcoin,Bitcoin's fundamentals haven't changed since the price fell,"The financial crisis predicted by economists has finally begun. As we have seen, since March 9, 2020, the virus that has spread throughout the world has become a catalyst for a sharp decline in financial markets.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/8dr6q251hfn41.png?width=450&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7683d8c0bac183b81d5705f23c4b547ab5118e70

The growing economic crisis has triggered collective panic, and for 99% of people, it is imperative to restore as much liquidity as possible. Logically, we are facing a liquidity crisis that is having a significant impact on the liquidity of all financial markets around the world. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Index has fallen by 20% in the past 5 days. Over the past month, the Dow Jones Index has fallen by about 30%, and the S &amp; P 500 has undergone the same adjustment.

&amp;#x200B;

In the rest of the world, the situation is exactly the same. For centuries, gold has been used as a safe-haven asset in times of crisis, but in recent days it has fallen by more than 10%.

&amp;#x200B;

When everyone is in panic, there is no safe haven at all. In this case, it is impossible for Bitcoin to not fall. Bitcoin is a highly liquid market, and it can even be said that it is the only truly free market in the world.

&amp;#x200B;

Even though Bitcoin has evaporated $ 60 billion in market value in just a few hours, it continues to operate, allowing investors to find equilibrium prices on their own.

&amp;#x200B;

Whether an asset has hedging properties requires long-term measurement. Similarly, the correlation between Bitcoin and other assets cannot be concluded in these days. At this point, if we step back, we can see the big picture instead.

&amp;#x200B;

Although the price of Bitcoin has changed, has its fundamentals changed? No, the fundamentals of Bitcoin March 18 are the same as those of March 1. Bitcoin still maintains good fundamentals, which gives us reason to be optimistic about the future of Bitcoin.

&amp;#x200B;

01

&amp;#x200B;

Bitcoin is as scarce as ever

&amp;#x200B;

The price of Bitcoin dropped from $ 9,000 to more than $ 3,000 within a few days. Its price has now stabilized at around $ 5,300. The current global situation is in turmoil, and panic in the market may cause the price of the currency to fall below $ 5,000 again.

&amp;#x200B;

However, no matter what the price of Bitcoin is, it remains as scarce as ever.

&amp;#x200B;

Bitcoin is still the rarest decentralized invention ever made by human beings, and no matter what happens, the maximum supply of Bitcoin will not change. No leader in this world can change the fact that the total amount of Bitcoin is 21 million.

&amp;#x200B;

So after the crisis, gold and bitcoin will eventually resume their roles, and when prices will rise again, those who have seized the opportunity will get huge returns.

&amp;#x200B;

02

&amp;#x200B;

Unique monetary policy

&amp;#x200B;

Bitcoin was created by Satoshi Nakamoto in response to the 2008 financial crisis. Realizing that the currency and financial system have reached their limits, Satoshi Nakamoto decided to officially launch the Bitcoin experiment on January 3, 2009, and wrote in the genesis block: The Treasury Secretary is on the brink of saving the bank for the second time. ""

&amp;#x200B;

Therefore, we can also think that Bitcoin was created for what we will experience in the coming weeks or months. When Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin, he hoped to obtain a scarcity similar to gold, so the longer it took, the more difficult it was to create a new Bitcoin. For every 210,000 additional transaction blocks, the number of newly mined Bitcoins will be halved.

&amp;#x200B;

Initially, for every additional transaction block in the Bitcoin blockchain, 50 new bitcoins will be generated, and by May 2020, the bit will be halved for the third time, after which each additional block will only add 6.25 BTC. Therefore, the number of new bitcoins created daily in the future will be reduced from 1800 to 900, which will have a certain impact on the total supply of bitcoin.

&amp;#x200B;

This single monetary policy is a huge advantage of Bitcoin over the current monetary and financial system. After the third Bitcoin halving, the annual inflation rate of Bitcoin supply will definitely fall below 2% to 1.8%. In the future, bitcoin's annual supply inflation will tend to zero, and will reach zero in 2140, at which time all bitcoin will be mined.

&amp;#x200B;

Bitcoin's monetary policy can protect what you have, and it was still valid when the Fed just decided to inject more than $ 700 billion in US banks. It can be said that from the perspective of how Bitcoin operates, the Fed still has a lot to learn.

&amp;#x200B;

03

&amp;#x200B;

Bitcoin network is still decentralized

&amp;#x200B;

Anyone can join the Bitcoin blockchain and become a node in the network. In the Bitcoin world, all users are equally important. All this makes Bitcoin able to withstand the obstacles of powerful people in the current system.

&amp;#x200B;

No one can stop you from using Bitcoin at will. At any time, if you want, you can sell all your Bitcoins. This is why the price of bitcoin has fallen sharply in the past few days. Bitcoin operates permanently by letting users determine its equilibrium price.

&amp;#x200B;

Once the stock price falls too fast, Wall Street will cease to trade. At this point, Bitcoin once again shows its superiority over Wall Street. The basic fact that Bitcoin is the only truly free market in the world has been proven again a few days ago.

&amp;#x200B;

04

&amp;#x200B;

Bitcoin remains a secure decentralized network

&amp;#x200B;

In its 11 years, the Bitcoin network has never been hacked. Bitcoin's security has never been breached and it's incredible to think about it, because hackers from all over the world have been trying to attack Bitcoin over and over again.

&amp;#x200B;

Still, Bitcoin has stood on its feet. The theft in the Bitcoin world exists only at the weakest link: trading platforms and users. Since its birth, Bitcoin has been operating normally 99.98% of the time. There is nothing enviable about the normal operation of Internet giants such as Google, Amazon, or Facebook.

&amp;#x200B;

However, Bitcoin's secure operation is based only on the user's computing power. These people are so convinced about the future of Bitcoin that they have been providing more computing power to the network.

&amp;#x200B;

At the beginning of 2020, the hashrate of the Bitcoin network reached a peak of 130TH / s. The recent drop in the price of Bitcoin and the accompanying collective panic have led to a decline in computing power, but currently still maintain the level of 100 TH / s.

&amp;#x200B;

In this crisis, Bitcoin remains the most secure decentralized network in the world. Secondly, you should notice that the basic situation of Bitcoin has improved a lot since the end of 2017. Due to the sharp increase in transaction volume at the end of 2017, the overall network speed has slowed down, but this time, Bitcoin standing in the storm has been able to absorb an entire transaction volume peak without any stalls.

&amp;#x200B;

05

&amp;#x200B;

Bitcoin still belongs to everyone

&amp;#x200B;

The high fluctuations in the price of bitcoin in the past week remind us that bitcoin still belongs to everyone and everyone can sell bitcoin freely. When Bitcoin depreciated by 50% within hours, the transaction continued.

&amp;#x200B;

At the same time, once the market falls more than 7%, Wall Street will suspend trading for 15 minutes. This fusing mechanism has been applied several times since the liquidity crisis broke out in the market.

&amp;#x200B;

Wall Street is not a free market. It belongs to a few powerful people who protect their interests at all costs. Once the market does not turn around and continues to fall, Wall Street will call on the Federal Reserve to maintain the current system.

&amp;#x200B;

The Federal Reserve ’s monetary stimulus measures have become less and less effective. It cut interest rates by 100 basis points on March 15, 2020. At the same time, it introduced a quantitative easing plan to reduce the bank deposit reserve ratio to zero. This series of measures was even affected Opposition to Wall Street. Once again, Bitcoin stands out in the current system with its strong fundamentals.",cryptocurrency
Bitcoin,Can Bitcoin separate from the independent market,"Recently, the price of Bitcoin plunged to $ 3,600 on BitMEX and $ 3,800 on Bitfinex, setting the worst one-day drop in seven years. The sell-off coincided with a sharp correction in the US stock market.

Bitcoin, at least in theory, should be a safe-haven asset immune to the turbulence of traditional financial markets. However, in the past two weeks, as investors frantically sold high-risk assets, Bitcoin has begun to fall in sync with the stock market.

Do US stocks dive leading crypto market down?

Over the past week, the bitcoin price has responded to several key events, including President Trump's announcement of a 30-day travel ban between the United States and Europe, and the Federal Reserve's announcement to reduce the federal benchmark interest rate to 0.00% -0.25% Levels and more.

Compared with the trend of S &amp; P 500, Bitcoin is almost the same as Bitcoin.

OKEx's advanced analysis is that William told Golden Finance, ""Just as bitcoin price has no correlation with gold, there is no obvious correlation between bitcoin and U.S. stocks. The reason why U.S. stocks and bitcoin are falling is that the market is too lacking Liquidity, all funds are looking for safe, liquid assets. ""

He explained by way of example that, in normal time, the water in the well is difficult to connect with the water in the lake; but the sky fell and the water levels of the lake and the well fell sharply. Even so, there was not much connection between the two sides. Just because of the influence of the big climate.

US stocks are about to open. How is Bitcoin trending?

In the early morning of March 18, local time, all three major US stock index futures fell, triggering trading restrictions.

The S &amp; P 500 index futures contract for June 2020 fell to 2393.50 points, down 3.70%, hitting trading restrictions. The NASDAQ (7334.78, 430.19, 6.23%) index futures contract for June 2020 fell to 7064.25 points, hitting trading restrictions. The Dow Jones (21237.3809, 1048.86, 5.20%) index for the June 2020 contract was reported at 2039 points, which also hit trading restrictions.

Only 2 hours from the opening of the US stock market, will the US stocks reappear?

In this regard, industry analysts believe that the current US government is preparing to introduce the US $ 700 billion to the US $ 1 trillion stimulus plan and issue it directly to the public. All the US stocks rose due to this positive impact yesterday. But whether the liquidity crisis can be resolved is still a question mark. In addition, there are already confirmed cases in all states in the United States, the number of confirmed diagnoses in Europe is also rising sharply, a large number of factory shutdowns, which has a great impact on the stock market, so the probability of US stocks will fall in the next few months.

My girlfriend and I live together, she bought this house about a year ago before we got extremely serious and her parents helped her out. I now help pay the mortgage and we are paying at an interest rate of 4.75% for 30 years. I know federal interest rates have dropped as of this weekend but I do not know how that can affect us and our monthly payment. 

She has great credit (750+) and I on the other hand have no credit. I have always been well enough off to pay for things outright and if I couldn't then I just didn't buy it. We split utilities and mortgage payment down the middle and we are plenty comfortable. 

The situation that we have is that her lease on her vehicle is ending and we are going to buy it at the end of the 36 months this week. We are going to the bank today to get the loan that she needs for it. I thought that while we were there we might ask about the interest rate on the house and see if we can get something more competitive since Federal interest rates have dropped. Can anyone help tell me what I need to be asking. I sell cars for a living and am comfortable with auto loans but no idea on homes and if they are different.

investing,Ben Bernanke and Janet Yellen are urging the Fed to go beyond authority and buy corporate bonds,"Former Federal Reserve chairs Ben Bernanke and Janet Yellen are recommending that the central bank continue trying to shore up the economy against the coronavirus threat, even suggesting that it go beyond the powers it now has.

In [a Financial Times essay](https://www.ft.com/content/01f267a2-686c-11ea-a3c9-1fe6fedcca75), the two say the Fed should look for more authority that would give it the power to purchase corporate bonds on top of the Treasurys and mortgage-backed securities it already plans to buy.

“The Fed’s intervention could help restart that part of the corporate debt market, which is under significant stress,” Bernanke and Yellen wrote. “Such a program would have to be carefully calibrated to minimize the credit risk taken by the Fed while still providing needed liquidity to an essential market.”

Yellen and Bernanke served during the financial crisis, the latter as chairman and the former as head of the San Francisco Fed. Back then, they helped roll out a number of innovative programs aimed at recapitalizing the banking industry and getting money flowing through the financial system again to businesses and households.

The Fed already has deployed several of those tools, moving Tuesday into credit operations [for commercial paper](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/17/fed-announces-move-to-help-businesses-get-short-term-funding-in-commercial-paper-market.html) and another for [primary dealers that buy Treasurys directly from the government](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/17/the-federal-reserve-is-adding-another-program-to-aid-lending-to-businesses-and-households.html) and use the liquidity to fund credit for businesses and households. That’s on top of a $1 trillion a day [foray into the overnight repo markets](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/17/the-fed-will-keep-short-term-cash-injections-to-banks-going-through-the-week.html) where banks go for short-term funding and longer-term bond purchases.

Getting into corporate debt and its higher levels of risk, though, requires congressional approval. 

The two former chairs recommend that the Fed buy “limited amounts of investment-grade corporate debt” and pointed out that other global central banks already have that authority.

Bernanke and Yellen are not the first to recommend that the Fed go further out on the risk curve — some have suggested it buy into the equity market through exchange-traded funds — but the idea does seem to be gaining steam as the coronavirus crisis worsens. Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren in a recent speech suggested doing so.

“To avoid permanent damage from the virus-induced downturn, it is important to ensure that credit is available for otherwise sound borrowers who face a temporary period of low income or revenues,” Bernanke and Yellen wrote. Though they said the Fed has done much so far, “there is more that the central bank should consider doing as it helps Congress reduce the long-run effects of the downturn.”

I have been playing for a long time with [portfoliocharts](https://portfoliocharts.com).

Currently all A bonds in the world have their interest rate near zero or negative.

Playing around, I found: REIT and stocks have a positive correlation. Gold and commodities seem to hedge stocks but not consistently, and never protected in the same way as bonds did in the past. 

At the same time, it’s very possible that bonds will stay around 0 percent for a very long time, which has never happened in history, so simulators are not very useful.

investing,"NY Times Opinion Piece: ""This Is the Only Way to End the Coronavirus Financial Panic""","Interesting take by Andrew Ross Sorkin on NY Times today that argues for bridge loans to businesses and self-employed workers:

https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/18/business/dealbook/coronavirus-economy-bailout-plan.html

&gt; The Covid-19 crisis will take time to be solved by science. The economic crisis can be solved right now.

&gt; With President Trump proposing to send $1,000 checks to every American and industries, like the airlines, lining up for bailouts, there is a better way to arrest the panic.

&gt; **The fix: The government could offer every American business, large and small, and every self-employed — and gig — worker a no-interest “bridge loan” guaranteed for the duration of the crisis to be paid back over a five-year period.** The only condition of the loan to businesses would be that companies continue to employ at least 90 percent of their work force at the same wage that they did before the crisis. And it would be retroactive, so any workers who have been laid off in the past two weeks because of the crisis would be reinstated.

&gt; The price tag? A lot. Some back-of-the-envelope math suggests that many trillions — that’s with a “t” — of dollars would go out in loans if this crisis lasted three months, possibly as much as $10 trillion. That’s half the size of America’s gross domestic product. And assuming 20 percent of it is never repaid, it could cost taxpayers hundreds of billions if not several trillions. I get that. But with interest rates near zero, there is no better time to borrow against the fundamental strength of the U.S. economy, spend the money and prevent years of economic damage that would ultimately be far, far costlier.

personalfinance,is it a good time to refinance a car?,"I have a really bad interest rate currently (13%)  because when I moved to the US a year ago and bought a car, I had no credit history. I'm wondering given the current situation with federal interest rates being cut if it would be a good time to apply to refinance my car loan. I am not sure if that affects it at all, and generally I want to refinance anyway but have no idea how to approach it. Do I apply online? How does it get transferred from the current lender (Toyota financial) to a new one? I'm thinking of applying with a credit union because people say they have good rates. Also, I kind of got ripped off buying the car and the current value of the car is estimated to be $3000-4000 but I have about $6700 left on my loan (I paid $5000 as a down payment, I reaaaaaally got ripped off). This has been stressing me out for a long time and I'm not very good with finances. I needed a car asap after moving here and made a bad decision. My credit score now is 749 but still not much history. I'm hoping to get a better rate to make this a little easier. Please help &lt;3",finance

worldpolitics,The groundlessness of the claims of Western countries to Russia regarding actions in the Arctic region.,"The groundlessness of the claims of Western countries to Russia regarding actions in the Arctic region.

The Arctic is a territory on which there is a fierce struggle because of the wealth of minerals and a favorable strategic location. In this struggle, there are two opposite sides the Russian Federation and the United States with NATO countries.

Realizing its significant lag behind Russia, which, having the largest icebreaker fleet in the world, has succeeded in developing the extractive industry and military infrastructure, the United States, with the support of the followers from NATO rushed to implement the concept of a ""Global Presence"". Due to the fact that, even together these countries do not have sufficient resources to compete with the Russian Federation, a large-scale information campaign was launched that discredited the successes and the very fact of Russia's presence in the Arctic. Standard pretexts: growing threat to security of the international community in connection with the development of the Russian armed forces in the region; causing irreparable damage to the environment by Russian mining companies. In the first case the pressure comes directly from the political leaders of Western countries, but in the second – the same leaders finance private environmental organizations such as Greenpeace, Belona and others. Allegedly, from the position of the public, they accuse Russia of non-compliance with the requirements for ensuring the safety of the Arctic ecosystem in the process of its development.

However, the leadership of the Russian Federation in the statements of its representatives, including the president, has repeatedly made it clear that all military initiatives in the Arctic do not pose a threat to the security of other countries and are aimed solely at maintaining the country's defense capabilities, and the importance of environmental protection during the development of the region is undeniable. The data about the implementation of measures to clean the region from oil and other wastes, the appearance of which inevitably accompanies the development of mining and production activities serve as confirmation to this fact.",finance

investing,Bridgewater hedge funds fall further on coronavirus market rout,"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-bridgewater-idUSKBN21539W

(Reuters) - Bridgewater Associates LP, the Ray Dalio-led hedge fund giant famous for making money during the 2008 financial crisis, has posted double-digit losses so far this year amid sharp market declines sparked by the coronavirus outbreak, according to a note sent to clients on Wednesday and seen by Reuters. 

Through March 16, Bridgewater’s All Weather 12% volatility “risk parity” fund fell about 14% for the year; its Pure Alpha 18% volatility hedge fund declined about 21%; and its Major Markets 14% volatility hedge fund dropped about 7%, Dalio wrote. 
Dalio wrote that the performance was “not what I would want” but was “consistent with what I would have expected under the circumstances.” 
Bridgewater has assets under management of about $160 billion, according to its website, and is trusted by some of the world’s largest investors to safeguard their money no matter the economic environment. 
The S&amp;P 500 index tumbled 7% on Wednesday, triggering a 15-minute trading halt of Wall Street’s main indexes for the second time this week, on fears that stimulus measures may not be enough to avert a coronavirus-driven recession. 

Dalio said Bridgewater’s portfolios were positioned for relative economic strength but also had hedges on in case of an unanticipated steep market decline. The firm’s risk controls worked as designed, he said, adding that Bridgewater remained liquid and able to adjust its positions. 
“Going forward, the world has now crossed a very dangerous threshold for financial markets and economies that poses great risks for all investors,” Dalio wrote, citing interest rates falling below zero percent amid an economic downturn, inequality and populism. 

“It is one we have been preparing for for a long time.” 

CHINA RUMORS 
On Wednesday, Dalio posted on popular Chinese microblogging site Weibo to dispel rumors about a Bridgewater blow-up. 

“There has been a rumor going around China that Bridgewater has ‘crashed’ or ‘is in trouble,’ Dalio wrote, attaching the client note with the firm’s performance and views. “You have my word that that is totally false and that Bridgewater is totally safe.” 
He condemned “bad people” who spread such rumors. “I think we might have identified the rumor monger which we will pursue legally and disclose publicly if we are able.”",finance

personalfinance,Question about Roth IRA's and savings,"Hello, I have recently been reading more into retirement accounts and investing, as there is a fire sale going on with stocks. I'm in a very lucky position in that my parents are paying for my college, and the $29k I have saved up over my teenage years is chilling in a HYSA.

I already make a 5% (4% employer matched) on my measly $500/month part time salary, I have just over $200 in a Roth 401k. I try to save an additional 30%-40% in my HYSA after minimal living expenses. I still want to have quick access to the money, in case of the need to buy a used car, pay for college to avoid loans, or possibly have a down payment for land in the next 5-7 years.

I've read that you can take out the contributions from a Roth IRA penalty free, so this essentially makes it into a savings account that would earn tons more but if I needed to, I could take out the cash in an emergency?

My question would be, is it the smartest decision right now to open a personal Roth IRA, dump $6,000 from last years limit, and $6,000 for this year (before April 15th)?

This would still leave me with $17,000 to use for the next 3 years of college, but I would get a way better interest rate and start on the path of saving for retirement. Also, if needed I could pull out the contribution too without taking a hit.",finance

I am a 22 year old who lives paycheck to paycheck, and I am now on the verge of being evicted from my apartment. As I am waiting to hear back from my leasing office I am trying to explore what avenues I have. 
I do no have much in my 401k, but the amount I have available to either withdrawal or take out on a loan would be enough to keep me afloat, but I am at a lost for what to do. I do not have people in my life who can help me understand how this all works, and I was hoping you guys could help give me a little advice. 

If I need to touch my 401k to keep from falling homeless, should I do a withdrawal or a loan? The loan options I have are general purpose or a primary residence loan, both have a $50 fee and a 4.75% interest rate with weekly paycheck deductions and a 6 month freeze on further contributions to the 401k. 

What exactly does that mean? I understand some of it, but I am not sure what the long term impact of a loan would be on a weekly basis. Is that a good option or for the current climate would it be a good idea to just go with a withdrawal? 

Im sorry for all my questions and I sincerely appreciate any advice anyone has. I hope everyone stays healthy and safe.",finance

personalfinance,Trying to file for unemployment online in California. How can I actually get a hold of the information I need when I can't my past employers?,"I'm relatively young and very new to filing for unemployment. I've always lived on minimum wage from one paycheck to the next, so riding this out is gonna be difficult and stressful unless I can get this done right. The problem is that I've also always worked in food service or retail, and all of those locations are shut down due to COVID-19 concerns, without me having any contact with past managers or any guarantee that I can get a hold of them through their store phones.  


The state of California has a list of several different pieces of information that I would need to submit as part of my claim:  
 

* Last employer information including company name, supervisor’s name, address (mailing and physical location) and phone number
* Last date worked and the reason you are no longer working
* Gross earnings in the last week you worked, beginning with Sunday and ending with your last day of work
* Information on all employers you worked for during the past 18 months, including name, address (mailing and physical location), the dates of employment, gross wages earned, hours worked per week, hourly rate of pay, and the reason you are no longer working.
* Notice to Federal Employees About Unemployment Insurance, Standard Form 8 (former federal employees only)
* DD 214 Member 4 copy (ex-military only)
* Citizenship status, and, if you are not a U.S. citizen, information from your employment authorization document

What I'm mainly concerned about is items 4 and 5 on this list. Under normal circumstances, I'd just be able to call the place of business and ask about how I can go about receiving this information, then wait to receive it before I could file my claim. I never expected to have to keep these things on file - school doesn't teach this, and neither does daily life.

What I'm mainly asking is, is there any online or over-the-phone resource, federal or state or otherwise, that will allow me to most easily obtain this information? I know for a fact that one of my past employers would make me have to wait weeks to receive that information, even if money's already hemorrhaging in the meantime. I need this as quickly as possible so that I can file within the first week of having my hours cut. Thank you guys in advance.

personalfinance,Divorce advice needed for buying wife out of condo and setting up escrow for kids' tuition,"Getting divorced after 26 years in Illinois. Wife does not work. Very amicable process (so far).

I'm looking at $7K/month in maintenance (forever) and $2K/month in child support for our 15 and 17 YO.

I am going to buy wife out of condo and she will move out.

We need to set aside about $110K for private school tuition, as we will no longer be able to afford these fees after the divorce - and it is very important to us to keep the two kids in their respective private schools.

Here are the numbers:

My 401(K) = $560K --&gt; now $430K after the crash

Condo mortgage = $305K, 15-year at 3.5%

Home value $425K

We have no other assets.

Original plan (two months ago) was to take $140K out of the 401(K) via the QDRO mechanism to avoid fees and set up an escrow for the $110K (after taxes). Two-thirds would come from my portion of the 401(K) split and 1/3 from hers.

I would take a line of credit on the condo of $60K to buy her out of her equity.

Given the crash, change in interest rates, etc. I'm rethinking this plan and could use advice.

Am happy to provide other numbers, etc., if helpful. Thanks for the advice.",finance

* How should I prioritize paying off my debt?  Which one should I pay off first?
* Should I take a personal loan from the credit union and consolidate all my credit card debt?
* How should  I use my signing bonus? emergency fund? Pay off highest interest credit card?

* What I can do right away to improve my credit score?
* Having never been employed before, I have never had any savings in 401(K). Should I put something in it? Employer will match after I complete a year in the company.

I paid off my car last week and credit cards so I don’t have anything due. My current rent is approx $1,000/month with utilities and spend about $700 on food, drinks, gas, etc. 

Currently I have $10,000 in an emergency fund, $2,000 in my roth 401k, $2,000 in an HSA and $1,500 in a betterment robo-advising account. I just started working in June and make $60,000 base salary with a $9,000 bonus which I got in Feb-2020 (was prorated to $2,400 after taxes due to start date). 

Basically not sure what to do with the money. A couple initial thoughts I’ve had are I should open up a Roth IRA and max it out for 2019 and 2020 since I haven’t paid taxes yet. Then I was thinking of keeping it in my account and using it to pay my expenses while I use my paycheck to max out my HSA (unsure if I can do this for 2019 &amp; 2020) and my roth 401k. The remainder I was thinking of putting in a CD at 1.7% since interest rates are down at the moment. 

I don’t really know what taxes will look like and how to handle this money. My goal in the next few years is to buy a condo/house or just continue growing my wealth until I settle down but it seems better to pay a mortgage rather then pay rent.

Bitcoin,"From Chaos, Comes Order","I feel it is important to discuss what is happening at the moment.

We're gonna break this down into 4 parts...

Let's start with the virus.

&amp;#x200B;

**Part 1 - The Virus**

Now, this virus.

First of all, I just want as a disclaimer to say that it's important to rely on official sources of information regarding the virus since they would never lie to you...

OK, so what's up? Well, here's what's up:

This virus is the trigger for the biggest power play we've seen since 2001.

This is a perfect excuse for an economic crash.

This defers responsibility from those who are actually responsible and blames it all on this virus.

It also accelerates the inevitable trend towards a cashless society, and the much desired Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC).

We've had [Christine Lagarde](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chHnk6lSc5A) (former head of the IMF and current President of the ECB) and [Mark Carney](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPgWAWNyqMU) (former Governor for the Bank of England and current UN special envoy on climate action and climate finance) speak on digital currencies.

We've had reports from the Bank for International Settlements (BIS). The BIS is essentially the Central Bank for Central Banks.

Coincidence is a funny thing (just ask Larry Silverstein...):

In 2019, 1200 CEOs left their positions. That was a record year.

In the first month of 2020, 219 CEOs left. A new record.

On the topic of CEOs...

&amp;#x200B;

**Part 2 - CEOs and Stock Buybacks**

The financial metrics which incentivise executives have become far removed from operating performance.

As an example, [here is a story from the end of 2014.](https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-buybacks-pay/)..

This summarises perfectly what has happened!

The main source of demand for equities has been corporations (i.e.stock buybacks).

And this makes sense, incentives drive human behaviour. Pretty simple.

Now, *this* is the really infuriating part.

These corporations now want bailouts.

By the way, this will happen.

And just like '08, profits are privatised and losses are socialised.

The Airlines, which feel they are entitled to bailouts, [spent 96% of their free cash flow on stock buybacks over the past decade](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/airline-bailout-coronavirus-share-buyback-debate-trump-economy-aoc-2020-3-1029006175).

Now they want a bailout. Ridiculous!

&amp;#x200B;

**Part 3 - Encryption and Privacy**

While all of this is going on, the US Government has been sneakily trying to remove end-to-end encryption and it's been [working it's way through Congress](https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/3/12/21174815/earn-it-act-encryption-killer-lindsay-graham-match-group).

This concerns the EARN IT Act.

The premise of the bill is that technology companies have to earn Section 230 protections rather than being granted immunity by default, as the Communications Decency Act has provided for over two decades.

If the EARN IT Act were passed, tech companies could be held liable if their users posted illegal content. When internet companies become liable for what their users post, those companies *aggressively moderate speech*.

&amp;#x200B;

**Part 4 - Practicality**

Central Bank Digital Currencies are inevitable.

The NSA created the SHA-256 algorithm in 2001.

The NSA could of stopped Bitcoin early on if it truly wanted to (51% attack for example).

Why NOW allow a decentralised network of value transfer to develop, whereas previous attempts were snuffed out?

Well, going back to central banking: how about a centralised Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) that will allow a greater level of control, can facilitate negative interest rates, easier collection of taxes, etc.

For this to work, you need to usher it in gradually such that people have a decentralised alternative (i.e. BTC) and the mass public is more receptive to digital currencies more broadly. So BTC is the gold and CBDC is the ‘new fiat’.

The current situation is pretty chaotic.

But... ORDO AB CHAO

investing,Bloomberg opinion: unemployment due to coronavirus could surpass Great Depression levels,"Article here: https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-03-18/coronavirus-recession-is-already-causing-staggering-job-losses?utm_content=business&amp;cmpid=socialflow-facebook-business&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;utm_source=facebook 

The federal government is moving at a breakneck pace to respond to the coronavirus recession. In the states, however, the preliminary data suggests staggering job losses, exceeding economists’ expectations of just a week ago. If the pattern holds, it will mark the sharpest downturn in the labor market on record.

A spike in initial claims for unemployment insurance is among the earliest signs that a recession is underway. The most recent official number is from the first week of March, and it shows 221,000 claims, roughly on par with the average of the last several months.

State unemployment offices, however, are reporting huge increases in the volume of more recent claims. Hawaii reported 1,500 claims on Monday, five times the previous Monday. From Friday to Tuesday, Connecticut saw 30,000 claims, about 10 times the average for a whole week. Pennsylvania received a staggering 50,000 claims on Monday alone, compared to 12,000 claims for the first week of March.

All of this implies that, for the U.S. as whole, total initial claims for unemployment insurance for this week could spike to over 2 million. During the worst week of the Great Recession, the last week of March 2009, claims reached 665,000.

Some perspective: Even when the economy is booming, hundreds of thousands of workers file for unemployment benefits each week, and an even greater number find new jobs. In December 2007, by way of comparison, the U.S. economy added 108,000 jobs. In March 2009, it lost 800,000.

The correlation between unemployment insurance claims and the monthly payroll report is not exact. But simple extrapolation suggests that next month’s payroll report could show a total decline of roughly 4 million jobs. The human suffering behind that number is overwhelming. It all but requires Congress to pass without delay an increase the amount workers receive in unemployment insurance.

The macroeconomic consequences are if anything more dire. A typical recession gains steam because all workers reduce their spending: Some because they’ve lost their jobs, others because they expect to, others who are worried they might. This effect ripples through the economy.

The first month of major job losses during the Great Recession was February 2008, when the economy shed 906,000 jobs. The effect rippled throughout 2009, and during the entirety of the Great Recession about 8.5 million jobs were lost. A similar multiplier would place total job losses from the current recession at … 37 million.

Again, using back-of-the-envelope math, that implies a rise in the unemployment rate to about 27% — even higher than the 20% Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has warned as possible. It would exceed the highest unemployment on record, 24.9%, set during the Great Depression. To repeat: These are rough estimates based on early data.

Moreover, the coronavirus recession is, structurally speaking, unlike any that have come before it. Many of the measures the public is being asked to take are voluntary, so it is possible that economy could bounce back rapidly once they are lifted. On the other hand, because social distancing will have to continue for months, it could be that the initial shock is compounded several times over.

In either case, the government and the public should be prepared for a dramatic and uncertain economy.",finance

Can you put it together yet? 

What do people need to survive? It's not a PS4 or social media. It’s FOOD, WATER, &amp; SHELTER. Seeing how most people have shelter, the next step will be to cut through all of the red tape by using the powers allowed in the Defense Production Act to supply FOOD &amp; WATER to the American people. 

My thesis is simple. Companies like Blue Apron and Hello Fresh will soon get a literal ton of money thrown at them to supply the American people with clean and healthy food during what I believe is an almost certain mandatory quarantine. It's the only way to get ahead of this terrible virus to save our citizens as well as our tumbling economy. 

All of the steps needed are already in place. I suspect it will happen very soon. 

Based on the trading volume, it seems like there is already a ton of insider trading taking place with Blue Apron. I suspect insider trading is being conducted by the people in the know, which unfortunately would be our esteemed elected officials and the companies that own them, which is an unfortunate issue to even think about. These humble servants to the American people do have a history of such behavior. We the people go to jail over insider trading but for some reason elected officials have been pulling that stunt for decades with no real consequences and even talking about enforcing your own level of justice will land you in a lot of trouble. 

If I am correct about the insider trading than this virus will be pebbles compared to the catastrophic mess we will soon face as a nation. Think ancient Rome and how it fell.... Corruption.

**Part 2 - CEOs and Stock Buybacks**

The financial metrics which incentivise executives have become far removed from operating performance.

As an example, [here is a story from the end of 2014.](https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-buybacks-pay/)..

This summarises perfectly what has happened!

The main source of demand for equities has been corporations (i.e.stock buybacks).

And this makes sense, incentives drive human behaviour. Pretty simple.

Now, *this* is the really infuriating part.

These corporations now want bailouts.

By the way, this will happen.

And just like '08, profits are privatised and losses are socialised.

The Airlines, which feel they are entitled to bailouts, [spent 96% of their free cash flow on stock buybacks over the past decade](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/airline-bailout-coronavirus-share-buyback-debate-trump-economy-aoc-2020-3-1029006175).

Now they want a bailout. Ridiculous!

**Part 3 - Encryption and Privacy**

While all of this is going on, the US Government has been sneakily trying to remove end-to-end encryption and has been [working it's way through Congress](https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/3/12/21174815/earn-it-act-encryption-killer-lindsay-graham-match-group).

This concerns the EARN IT Act.

The premise of the bill is that technology companies have to earn Section 230 protections rather than being granted immunity by default, as the Communications Decency Act has provided for over two decades.

If the EARN IT Act were passed, tech companies could be held liable if their users posted illegal content. When internet companies become liable for what their users post, those companies *aggressively moderate speech*.

**Part 4 - Practicality**

Central Bank Digital Currencies are inevitable.

The NSA created the SHA-256 algorithm in 2001.

The NSA could of stopped Bitcoin early on if it truly wanted to (51% attack for example).

Why NOW allow a decentralised network of value transfer to develop, whereas previous attempts were snuffed out?

Well, going back to central banking: how about a centralised Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) that will allow a greater level of control, can facilitate negative interest rates, easier collection of taxes, etc.

For this to work, you need to usher it in gradually such that people have a decentralised alternative (i.e. BTC) and the mass public is more receptive to digital currencies more broadly. So BTC is the gold and CBDC is the ‘new fiat’.

The current situation is pretty chaotic.

Banking,Restaurant owners with sales down 90% with very bad credit,"I'm a restaurant owner in Florida in a county that ordered restaurants to close except for pickup and delivery. Our sales are down 90%. We employ 10 amazing people, and I'm attempting to spread the little hours we can afford out to everyone as fairly as possible. We have enough cash to last us a couple weeks, max, at this rate, while still making payroll. We're looking at every other possible cost-saving and survival option, but this post is specifically about the following:

Three separate emergency relief programs have been announced. One is the Florida Small Business Emergency Bridge Loan, the other is the one in the Senate that will distribute $300bn in federally guaranteed loans, and the other is an SBA disaster relief loan.

Our restaurant would certainly apply for these programs, except for the fact that my personal credit is very poor due to a recently declared personal bankruptcy and for both the Bridge Loan and the SBA one, they make it clear they check the personal credit of the owners. For the Bridge loan, the language on their site is the following:

&gt; Loans will be made to individuals who, individually or collectively, own at least 51% of the equity of the business. 

And for the SBA loan, it is

&gt; Complete copies, including all schedules, of the most recent Federal income tax returns for each principal owning 20% or more of the applicant business, each general partner or managing member, and each affiliate when any owner has more than a 50% ownership in the affiliate business. 

Our restaurant is set up as an LLC, with myself and my spouse as the owners, each owning 50%.

I'm asking this in the Banking forum because all these loans (at least for sure the Senate one) will be managed and disbursed by local banks and CUs.

I've thought about adding two more members as owners to our LLC, my two brothers who have agreed to it (who have good credit), so that they can apply in their name. Would this be OK to do?

Any other thoughts or ideas on how to get access to these emergency funds with bad credit?

This virus is the trigger for the biggest power play we've seen since 2001.

This defers responsibility from those who are actually responsible and blames it all on this virus.

It also accelerates the inevitable trend towards a cashless society, and the much desired Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC).

personalfinance,Using 529 to pay my own Student Loans (SECURE Act),"I have tried to do some research on the SECURE Act and how it could benefit me as I pay off my student loans, but am struggling with a few details.  If someone could explain and also provide resources for reading that would be awesome, so thanks in advance.

My understanding is that with Trump signing the SECURE Act I can now use a 529 plan to pay my monthly student loan payment.  I live in MI, so it is also my understanding that I can deduct up to $10,000 of annual 529 contributions similar to deducting 401K contributions.

But, in reading this article ([https://www.usnews.com/education/best-colleges/paying-for-college/articles/what-to-know-about-paying-student-loans-with-529-plan-funds](https://www.usnews.com/education/best-colleges/paying-for-college/articles/what-to-know-about-paying-student-loans-with-529-plan-funds)) it discusses a lifetime limit of $10,000 to pay off student loans without taxes or penalties:

""The Setting Every Community Up for Retirement Enhancement Act, a spending bill known as the SECURE Act, established a lifetime limit of $10,000 from a 529 plan that can be used without any penalties or tax consequences to repay the beneficiary's student loans, including federal and most private loans.""

So, if I were to contribute $10,000 to a MI 529 plan this year and then use that to pay my student loan payments this year I would max that lifetime limit and the tax benefit of doing this is now nullified moving forward?  Also, can I create a 529 and make myself the beneficiary to even do this?

&amp;#x200B;

Again, thanks for any help people can impart.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: also, if I do this payment now, would that effect my ability to help my kids using this tool in the future?  Of course I'm sure laws pertaining to student loans will change dramatically in 17+ years (daughter is currently 1yo), but in how they are written now.",finance

Tuesday morning they inform us that the rate went up (3.425), but they'll keep us posted throughout the day. Crickets...


Wednesday I follow up, of course they have gone up (3.5). I say screw it, LOCK us before they go up even more. Our lender was ""in a meeting"", so it got submitted too late. You know what happens next...


Here we are today (Thursday), and rates are way the hell up there.


I understand why rates are going up - supply and demand. My question is: with our closing date in mid-April (a month away), do we cut bait and lock high? Or do we wait a few weeks and see what happens?

investing,Some historical perspective on the current market meltdown,"I've been investing since some of you kid's were in diapers; through the Russian debt crisis/LTCM bailout, Y2K, .Com bust, 9/11, Mortgage Meltdown and now COVID.  The market is doing what the market does and will go back to doing what we are all used to it doing.  Every single bear market/recession is followed by a bull market and every single bull market is ended by a catalyst that ""everyone saw coming"".

To Put COVID in perspective, ""the market"" has survived

*  Panics of 1857, 1869, 1873, 1893
* Switch from the gold standard
* Civil War
* Wall Street Bombing of 1920
* Great Depression
* WW1, WW2
* Vietnam and the Oil Crisis
* 1987 Crash
* Savings and Loan crisis

Despite all of that, the real (inflation adjusted) return on equities for the measurable \~200 year history of the market has average 7% (source is Jeremy Seigle ""stocks for the long run"" page 12).  

We have industries today that one would not be able to fathom 100 years ago, let alone 200 years ago when we were an agrarian dominated slave holding society.  Along the way entire industries have been created, then wiped out, then built again.  In the short term market dips are always painful, in the long run, as long as you have a piece of that broad market you will be rewarded well. 

Lets look at the 1929 crash and resulting great depression - had you invested at the peak

* It took 25 years for the DOW to regain it's peak - but  re-investing dividends would have made you whole in 7 years.
* reinvesting and accounting for inflation (deflation) and you are made whole in [5 years](https://www.businessinsider.com/henry-blodget-new-study-stocks-only-took-5-years-to-recover-after-1929-2009-4).  

Mind you 1929 was the worst the US has ever seen and is likely to ever see.  Will things get as bad/worse as they were in 1929? Probably not

* Monetary policy (The Fed) is an accepted practice.  
* Social Insurance (un-eployement, ssi, etc) means we won't see roving hordes of poor people raiding food supplies.

Hold up - you don't understand.  COVID is a pandemic like none other; people will die, industry will be decimate, blah, blah blah.  Lets look at the two worst case scenarios; Germany and Japan during WW2

* Germany - 90% drop in real equity prices, followed by a 30% per year return for the next 12 years
* Japan - 98% drop in real equity, breakup of industrial cartels and distribution of shares to workers, followed by a 10.4% avg annual real return.

COVID is not a conquering army, My thoughts on what is likely to happen.

* Market will bleed 30% to 50% of it's peak - if we go past 50% its time to beg/borrow/steal and go all in.
* We will see a net decline of jobs which will be cushioned by a shift in demand.  Amazon is hiring 100k people (and bitch all you want, they pay better than many of the mom and pops that are folding).  Any one in the medical field/retail grocery is having a bonanza,
* un-employment and other social insurance will kick in and there will not be an economic tsunami caused by the retail/hospitality workers being unable to pay rent/bills.
* Manufacturing will see a resurgence both in short/long term.  GM is already angling to make respirators. Companies that can adapt will do so and thrive.  Companies that go bankrupt were likely on the edge well before this.  Also this should be the canary in the coal mine for the US to wake up and on-shore it's critical industries.

My advice for you kids

* Set aside an emergency fund (3-6mo exp)
* Invest in broad market indexes and may it automatic via payroll or monthly deductions.  This ensures you never invest at a market peak and will avoid any worst case scenario.
* set saving goals (house/car/etc) and understand asset allocation and what your risk tolerance is
* For folks nearing retirement, understand that retirement is a continuum.  One does not retire and need 100% of their savings in cash.  On the contrary, you have 20+ years for those assets to continue to work for you.
* Understand and heed the yield curve.

Closing thoughts; this is normal and something  I am viewing as a buying opportunity.   To quote two investment legends, you really have two options.

The stock market is tanking, as well as the bond market. The federal reserve is printing trillions, massive quantitative easing will be the norm for the next decade. They have no other choice, it’s either monetize the debt or cut gov spending; and we know it’s going to be debt monetization. 

BA is just the beginning for the bailouts; nearly every sector in the economy is going to need a bailout. All due to the federal reserve keeping interest rates low for a decade; with cheap money, companies overleveraged themselves with debt and used most of their cash flow on stock buybacks. These companies and shareholders should go bankrupt and take their losses; the American people shouldn’t be paying for their mistakes. Someone else who knows how to run a company and keep a cash reserve, will simply come in and buy these companies when they go BK. Under new management, these companies can finally go through the process of becoming profitable again. But instead, our socialist government wants to bailout everyone who fails; life isn’t fair, prepare for the worst. These zombie companies will be kept alive with bailouts and it’ll result in yet another decade of failed 2.5% growth. 

The currency/debt crisis is going to hurt the US badly over the next 5-10 years.

I remember the Greek gov had closed the banks for a bit and limited the amount you could withdraw from the atm. The lines were really long and you could only withdraw around $200. 

Honestly I don’t think it’d be a bad idea to get some cash out next week just in case. Safe haven will be gold as usual. Gold and silver coins selling out online fast. I see all Canadian maple leafs and US eagles sold out. Shipping delays anywhere from 3-15 days. Bullion dealers are waiting for 2020 inventory to come in from the mints.

If this is the route to go, I would need to act quickly while I have my last few paychecks coming in.

Unfortunately we know the drill this time when it comes to budgeting: no gym membership, cut the entertainment costs, eat in more, and so on. The recommended social distancing actually helps. We do have an emergency fund, but only $1500. We recently paid off a six-figure student loan debt and just started trying to save move. The only two debts remaining are my wife's car ($9800 remaining, $400/month, 4.5% interest) and our mortgage ($182000 remaining, \~$205000 unofficial valuation, $950/month before escrow, 4% interest VA loan).  I have read about a VA interest rate reduction program that could drop the interest to below 3.5%. I am just not sure if this is the right move.

$1,532 - collections ($1,005 medical, $527 credit card)
$9,694 - student loans
$11,921 - auto 19% interest (2017 Kia Forte LX with 2 accidents on carfax)

Monthly bills:
$359.95 - monthly car payment (40 months left)
$124 insurance (USAA) 
$65 - phone (AT&amp;T FirstNet)

Income: 
New RN, 
$23.62/hr base + $3.75 nights and $3.75 weekends, $1,200 per paycheck, $2,400/month (bring home). I'm in a resident program and I'm currently limited to 36 hours a week. I'm going to check and see if I can pick up extra each week though, but 36 hours is what I'm budgeting for right now.

My car payment is really sucking out a lot of unnecessary money due to the interest rate, I'm upside down and don't see much options for getting out of it besides refinancing. There is damage to it from 2 different people running into me without insurance. That reduced the amount a dealership was willing to give for a trade. The sales rep said I might even have trouble refinancing. KBB says it's worth around $10k in ""Fair"" condition. They offered $4,500 i think. Do I have any options? I would almost think that with things going the way they are, I may have a decent chance at making a good deal with the dealership but idk if they'd be willing to play ball. They also said my credit was 597 :( this was before paying off the credit card below.

I just recently paid off an old credit card ($1170) and barely saw a change in my credit according to Credit Karma. They are sending an Optima card application to help build back up. I don't plan on carrying a balance and it's for show really. Is getting credit cards right now a bad idea? I'm more responsible and know better than to screw up and miss the payments so I wouldn't think so.

I also have 16 missed payments on my student loans. I have 4 loans, and missed 4 months of payments a while back. This is making my payment history show like 84% and it seems to really hurt things.

The pandemic “will last 18 months or longer” and may take the form of “multiple waves” according to the report. It follows from the document that a pandemic can be accompanied by a shortage of various goods and will be a serious blow to the country's population and health system. The document is dated March 13, that is, in the afternoon when Trump declared a state of emergency in the United States. The plan contains gloomy forecasts for the spread of coronavirus and describes the response to it, including the creation of a number of government agencies and even the use of special presidential powers to mobilize the private sector. In particular, Trump can activate the 1950 Law on Defense Production, which allows the US president to take extraordinary measures and dramatically increase the production of critical equipment, including ventilation devices, respirators and protective equipment for health workers. Since the equipment for diagnostics, medicines and medical personnel may be in short supply. The plan also contains a forecast of a possible violation of communication channels between local authorities and the federal government, which will lead to a decrease in the quality of information on the development of the coronavirus pandemic, as well as interaction between various state and municipal structures.

So I have a friend (we'll call her Jane) that I had known since September. We work at the same restuarant but had since been laid off and would call us if they need more people. Anyways, I was on Snapchat and saw her story asking if there's anyone with a Navy Fed or Wells Fargo account. I swiped and asked what it was about and she said that she wants to link her account and transfer money to hold on to. 
I'm like okay I have Navy Fed what should I do. Then Jane asked for my email and username which I did give. I thought well if she's just connecting her account to mine it should be okay? Then she was asking for security answers and I didnt even remember them but gave my best guesses (at this point I was oblivious).
A moment later I get an email notification saying a new member-to-member account was created. It was a checking but it was under a totally different name that wasn't Jane's. I was like oh shit and before I could do anything else both my checking and savings were wiped, a total of $840. My heart sank and I was like wtf. I called Navy Fed and they told me to file a fraudulent claim and said it would take 10 days to investigate it.
I texted Jane through Snapchat and said hey what is this but no response. Then I texted her number asking if someone hacked her Snapchat and she did reply saying that she let someone borrow it for ""promo."" ?? And I'm like did you know that whoever that was wiped my shit and she didnt seem apologetic or anything. She was like oh no I'm blocking him now and I'm trying to get her to tell me his name but avoided it, only giving me ""George"" and a number. The number was unresponsive.

investing,Reserve ratios for systemically important companies,"Hi All,

Not sure that this is the best place to post this, but it is related to investments since it seems that at least a few companies/industries will be getting bailouts, or at least government support, sometime in the near future due to the current environment. I was wondering why large companies aren’t required to maintain reserve ratios if they meet certain criteria to be “systemically important”. Obviously it’s not yet a law, but given that in the USA there are already reserve ratios required of banks as well as the SIFI (systemically important financial institution) designation it seems like systemically important companies that employ exceedingly large numbers of people (perhaps Walmart), control or manage critical infrastructure (airlines), and/or perform national security related activities (Boeing, other defense contractors) should have to maintain a certain amount of money as a rainy day fund for potential future turbulence. Perhaps this reserve requirement would be a %, or multiple, of operating expenses or SG&amp;A expenses. Just like how the Fed recently set the reserve ratio to 0% for banks to help deal with COVID, a government agency (perhaps SEC) could allow companies in crisis to use their rainy day fund as a means to manage through while minimizing the need for government intervention. 

With this approach, companies would have a choice in which they can be systematically important (e.g. big, critical infrastructure, or national security) and have a tacit government guarantee which requires them to hold reserves. Alternatively, they can keep themselves smaller or select their areas of involvement to avoid this requirement, but then not benefit from the government guarantee. 

What are your thoughts?

All of the articles I've read say that despite the Fed's rate cut, and relatively low yield on the 10 year treasury, banks are swamped with refinance applications and are hiking rates to stifle demand. I think there must be more to this though - banks wanting to keep more cash on hand in case loan default rates start to rise. High demand and low supply for loans.

On the housing side, a lot of people are going to have interrupted income for a while. Unemployment is expected to rise. Many people who are close to losing a house may be pushed over the edge of foreclosure, or forced to list their house for sale. 

Combine this economic hardship-induced rise in supply with the back-log of people who were already planning on listing in early spring and are having to wait, and I think we may see an oversupply of homes on the market by late summer.

I've finally gotten it under control and making great strides in paying it off and finally staying inside my budget, in part thanks to a better job. In January I was a bit exasperated with all the different payments I was directing and took what I thought was a good deal on a personal loan thru lending club

stocks,FedEx (FDX) - Solid LT growth story hampered by ST pessimism,"Hey everyone, long-time lurker here who finally found the guts to post a DD. Today I want to talk about FedEx. Full disclosure, I am and have been long the stock since it dropped after 2Q earnings and have added more since then. I view FDX as a stable business that should grow in-line with global GDP in the long-term, and the growth of e-commerce globally could provide another secular tailwind for earnings growth. 

The stock is currently down ~60% from its ATH due to high capex spend in recent years, trade war impacts, and poor overall execution following the TNT acquisition. I think the stock is currently undervalued, and I am looking to hold it for the next 3-5 years for the following reasons:

1. China is ramping back up the economy per multiple accounts (commentary from recent earnings calls/interviews as I wouldn’t rely on CCP sources), and FDX has a chance to steal market share from passenger airlines that have reduced international flight capacity due to the coronavirus. Passenger airlines also carry cargo, which creates an opportunity for FDX to fill the gap. This should help them weather the economic downturn better than what the stock price currently implies. Even if Street consensus ($10.95/sh FY21 EPS or 10.2x P/E) is cut by 30%, the company would be trading at a 14.5x multiple on next year’s earnings, which I think is cheap for a company that should at least grow in-line with the global economy.

2. FDX has averaged ~$5Bn of annual cash from ops in the past 5 years, though it spent about the same amount on upgrading its aircraft fleet and sorting facilities. The capex spend will taper off by the end of FY22 (fiscal year ending in May 2022), unlocking significant FCF. Reducing capex to $3.5B (historical level before the current investment program) could increase FCF by ~$1.5-2Bn, while decreasing it to 80% of CFO (in-line with historical % of CFO) could increase it by $1Bn. For reference, UPS spent ~35% of their CFO on capex before their latest investment cycle. As the Street is focused on next years earnings per usual, the reduction in capex spend is not currently factored into the FCF estimates.

3. Lastly, integrating TNT, upgrading the aircraft fleet/sorting facilities, and finally combining Express and Ground shipments, which the company previously refused to do could help FDX expand its EBITDA margins and grow its international revenue-base. UPS has averaged ~15% EBITDA margin the past 5 years, which FDX underperformed that by 200bps, accounting for ~$2Bn cost disadvantage. Closing that gap could increase their return on invested capital that’s already in the double-digits, and could increase FCF by a total of $4Bn when combined with the reduced capex spend. This also isn’t factored into out-year Street estimates, and my estimates are not giving the company any credit for international revenue growth, so there could be potential upside to them.

Overall, I could see the stock hitting $180/sh if the first catalyst materializes, $200-300 with the first and second one combined, and $300+ if all three of them become reality.

Glad to discuss any questions/pushbacks on the stock. I am looking to improve my investment process and become a better investor along the way, so any feedback would be much appreciated.

Best,

personalfinance,Help with editing W4 for $0 Return,"I am at a total loss. My wife and I got married last year, so for our most recent taxes, we played with the numbers of filing jointly or separately.

Filing jointly, we were looking at ~$900 tax return. Filing separately, my wife ended up owing $400 federal, getting a $100 state refund. Whereas I ended up getting about $1000 each from both fed and state ($2000 total). So, the math said file separately.

Now, our goal this next year is to file jointly, and have as close to a $0 return as possible. I cannot, for the life of me, figure out what to do with our W4s. 

For one, I used the IRS estimate tool, and it told both of us to reduce our tax withholdings (seems weird if my wife ended up owing this past year).

For two, the estimator gave me a number to input into part 4(c) to reduce that withholding, and when I look at that line on my W4 it explains that a number in that section would INCREASE my withholding amount.

Can I piggyback the 120 service on one of the breakers, or do they need to be dedicated.

How do I ensure 220 GCFI supply these days?

I have a choice of heaters, a 6kw or 4kw. The smaller being recommended for older power supplies.

The house is from 1954 with 100 amp service that has seen some updating.

I know enough not to kill myself or start a fire, and I need to do it right.

Any takers?

Thanks for your time.",energy

personalfinance,What should I do with my bonus?,"I took a management role within my company last year and received quite a large bonus this week for hitting metrics last fiscal year. My initial plan was to eliminate all my high interest debt. This bonuses covers it all with not much wiggle room. However, with the recent steep drop in the market I am contemplating holding onto the cash until this covid thing has run its course and buying a lot super low. My  question is can I expect to out earn a 11 percent interest rate on my credit with the upswing when all this has passes or is it better to become debt free.  

For the record I am working remote and my income will generally be unchanged during this time. 

Thank you",finance
stocks,"In the current global financial climate, which stocks would you invest in for long term gains?","Hello everyone,

I’ve always said to myself that I’d invest my saved up money in stocks and since Coronavirus has crippled the global economy, I understand that now is the best time to act and put my money where my mouth is! I was wondering which stocks are worth investing in this current climate? I was initially going to short some stocks in the FTSE 100, though the BoE just cut their interest rates so I don’t think it’s a good idea at the moment. I can’t tell which direction the market is headed, so I thought I’d ask this subreddit which stocks they would put their money in? Which would be the safest, or riskiest? Or would it be a good idea to buy call/put options? Or should one wait for the storm to clear, and then buy shares at a low price?

Let me know down below! This is purely for my own knowledge, I won’t act on what people will write but it will help me influence my decisions.",finance

personalfinance,2018 state tax return got lost in mail. Unsure of what to do.,"""Lost"" may not be the best way to describe it but it's the best word I have for it.

I received my federal tax return for that year but my state one was sent to my school address but arrived at an inopportune time and got sent back to the mailing facility.
My concerns are that 

1. The check is expired by this point and I wouldn't be able to deposit it and

2. That I wouldnt be able to re-file(?) Because I could see that option being exploitable.

It was my first year filing taxes on my own and I wasn't taught how to deal with these types of issues and online and phone research has proven useless.

personalfinance,21 Y/O Post Grad Plan,"Hey everyone - looking for some general advice.

21 years old, graduated college in December.

Making \~ $70k annually out of school. $60k in student loans @ 6.5%. $2.5k car loan @ 10%. Nothing on credit cards. Have an $800/mo lease that is done with 2 months from now, then living at home with parents rent free. 740 FICO score.

With high income for a new graduate (but also a high loan balance), wondering how I should attack this. Currently I'm taking full employer match on 401K (6% to get 4.5%) and aggressively paying down the 10% loan (should be gone a month after my lease is done). Been making the minimum payment on my student loans (about $600/month). My parents are a dependable safety net so I'm going to start building up an emergency fund but not until after that 10% interest loan is paid off.

What are some logical steps to take to get ahead here? Especially with rates being so low right now due to corona virus. Considering refinancing student loans to take advantage of this. I've also been thinking about taking advantage of  low interest rates and getting a mortgage (\~$150,000) about a year out from now. In addition to taking advantage of low rates, HomeOne only requires 5% down. I believe legally you have to live in it before a year before you can rent it out if you take advantage of that opportunity. My long term play would be for it to be a rental that generates cash for me. Obviously an aggressive play but the housing market looks to be going down, interest rates going down, don't want to rush into it too much (would have to save up my 6 month emergency fund + down payment first, call it $22,000), but that shouldn't take too long living with my parents and making only the minimum payments on my student loans.

Sorry for the essay. Generally I would like to be aggressive but not reckless. I'm a Finance guy so leverage is appealing to me haha. Would appreciate everyone's input. Stay safe out there.",finance

personalfinance,Mom sold her business and is considering paying off her mortgage instead of parking cash in savings.,"My mom (70+) recently retired and sold her practice. She currently has a large amount of cash available from the sale, with more payments to be made over the next year. 

Right now, she has a mortage on a 2nd home. The 2nd home is occupied by family members who are living there rent free (paying only property taxes and upkeep, etc.). Therefore, there is no income on the property which mortgage interest payments will offset. As far as I know, there are no tax advantages to paying the mortgage interest here.

As of now, savings accounts are offering 1.5% rates and the mortgage interest rate is 3.75%.

My question is whether or not it would make more sense to pay off the mortgage and save 3.75% interest on the principal balance (a couple of hundred thousand) rather than parking cash in savings.

Things that I have already thought about:

- The interest rate my increase sometime in the future above 3.75%. This would require an increase in rates over 2.5% sometime in the future, which seems unlikely given Fed over the psat decade. 

- Having cash in hand may be safer now, and may be good to have for investment opportunities after market correction. However, paying off the mortgage will save her in payments a couple thousand per month and decrease her monthly outgoing cashflow. 

Are there any other considerations (taxes, etc.) that I am not accounting for? Many thanks in advance for the help and advice! Cheers and stay safe and health out there.",finance
worldpolitics,"From Chaos, Comes Order...","I feel it is important to discuss what is happening at the moment.

We're gonna break this down into 4 parts.

Let's start with the virus.

**Part 1 - The Virus**

Now, this virus.

First of all, I just want as a disclaimer to say that it's important to rely on official sources of information regarding the virus since they would never lie to you...

OK, so what's up? Well, here's what's up:

This virus is the trigger for the biggest power play we've seen since 2001.

This is a perfect excuse for an economic crash.

This defers responsibility from those who are actually responsible and blames it all on this virus.

It also accelerates the inevitable trend towards a cashless society, and the much desired Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC).

We've had [Christine Lagarde](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chHnk6lSc5A) (former head of the IMF and current President of the ECB) and [Mark Carney](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPgWAWNyqMU) (former Governor for the Bank of England and current UN special envoy on climate action and climate finance) speak on digital currencies.

We've had reports from the Bank for International Settlements (BIS). The BIS is essentially the Central Bank for Central Banks.

Coincidence is a funny thing (just ask Larry Silverstein...):

In 2019, 1200 CEOs left their positions. That was a record year.

In the first month of 2020, 219 CEOs left. A new record.

On the topic of CEOs...

**Part 2 - CEOs and Stock Buybacks**

The financial metrics which incentivise executives have become far removed from operating performance.

As an example, [here is a story from the end of 2014.](https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-buybacks-pay/)..

This summarises perfectly what has happened!

The main source of demand for equities has been corporations (i.e.stock buybacks).

And this makes sense, incentives drive human behaviour. Pretty simple.

Now, *this* is the really infuriating part.

These corporations now want bailouts.

By the way, this will happen.

And just like '08, profits are privatised and losses are socialised.

The Airlines, which feel they are entitled to bailouts, [spent 96% of their free cash flow on stock buybacks over the past decade](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/airline-bailout-coronavirus-share-buyback-debate-trump-economy-aoc-2020-3-1029006175).

Now they want a bailout. Ridiculous!

**Part 3 - Encryption and Privacy**

While all of this is going on, the US Government has been sneakily trying to remove end-to-end encryption and has been [working it's way through Congress](https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/3/12/21174815/earn-it-act-encryption-killer-lindsay-graham-match-group).

This concerns the EARN IT Act.

The premise of the bill is that technology companies have to earn Section 230 protections rather than being granted immunity by default, as the Communications Decency Act has provided for over two decades.

If the EARN IT Act were passed, tech companies could be held liable if their users posted illegal content. When internet companies become liable for what their users post, those companies *aggressively moderate speech*.

**Part 4 - Practicality**

Central Bank Digital Currencies are inevitable.

The NSA created the SHA-256 algorithm in 2001.

The NSA could of stopped Bitcoin early on if it truly wanted to (51% attack for example).

Why NOW allow a decentralised network of value transfer to develop, whereas previous attempts were snuffed out?

Well, going back to central banking: how about a centralised Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) that will allow a greater level of control, can facilitate negative interest rates, easier collection of taxes, etc.

For this to work, you need to usher it in gradually such that people have a decentralised alternative (i.e. BTC) and the mass public is more receptive to digital currencies more broadly. So BTC is the gold and CBDC is the ‘new fiat’.

The current situation is pretty chaotic.

But... ORDO AB CHAO

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

Which brings me to the title of this post. One of the main companies I am following right now is AFLAC. Has been consistently increasing it's dividend for like 40 years now, and has been increasing earnings for a long time as well. Took a bigger hit than the market due to coronavirus (more than 50%), and I'm not sure why. Maybe because their earnings could be disrupted by lowering interest rates?

* I closed the house **Dec 2018**, so most of my mortgage payment is going towards the Interest. I want to minimize my interest payment. 
* I'm unsure if I care about paying off the mortgage early. So long as total cost of taking out the loan is kept at a minimal( interest payments, and any other fee that I'm no aware of).
* Current Lender is a Credit Union...if that matters.
* No PMI
* Outstanding Principal: $279,344.18
* Current Interest Rate: 4.75%
* Approximate new Interest rate on a refinance - 3.75%
* Current monthly mortgage payment: **$1,484**
* I'm already talking to some lenders to refinance, and I assume they will get back to me with ""this is how much your monthly payments will be, You will save $XXX"" a month.
* I can ask my current lender to an adjusted amortization schedule if I were to increase my monthly payments. The increase would go directly to my principal.

&amp;#x200B;

**Question:**

So let's say I can pay an extra **$500** a month towards my principal of my current mortgage. I think there would be a point where it would be better for me to continue with my mortgage ($1,484 + $500), than to refinance. That refinance is bound to cost me some fee, and again I'm trying to minimize the total cost of taking out the loan.

How would I calculate which is the better route? 

Do I just wait for the refinance lenders to come back with...

* their amortization schedule - total all the interest payments
* their cost break down (closing cost?)

...and compare that number with the total future interest payments of the adjusted amortization schedule I received from my current lender?",finance
stocks,Brief history of recessions,"How did the Rothschild's make their wealth?

The Rothschilds made their wealth through the STOCK EXCHANGE. The mastermind behind their wealth was none other than NATHAN ROTHSCHILD. They heavily invested in Napoleon War. At the end of the war, the private intelligence service of Nathan enabled him to receive in London the news that Napoleon lost the Battle of Waterloo -a full day ahead of the government's official messengers. With this knowledge, Nathan decided to publicize false rumors that tricked the London stock Exchange into believing that Napoleon had won. Nathan even started selling his English stocks, causing others to do the same in a frenzy to get rid of their ""worthless English money."" The resulting Stock Market crash enabled Nathan Rothschild's agents to then buy up the London Stock market dirt cheap and seize control of the Bank of England right before London found out the truth about the battle.

One can only imagine how many people's hard earned savings and lives were destroyed because of this. When the English leaders found out they had no choice but to give their money over to the Red Shield, as slaves to the war debt. Since that time, the English have been paying their national taxes directly to the Red Shield private bankers (i.e. The Rothschild family) while the majority of their people have no clue...and yes, this is still going on today.

In spite of what Nathan did, he was quoted for even making a smart remark, ""Give me control of a nation's money and I care not who makes it's laws.""

Poor England is still suffering from that event 200 years later, and it most likely will not end. But what if they did it again? But this time gained control over another country as well? Sounds impossible? Even while owning a huge amount of the British economy, he was still hungry for more. And rest assure, he acted on that greed.

The Rothschild brothers repeated the exact same fraud in 1929, but this time with the New York Stock Market Crash that caused the great depression. It took them until this time to fully gain control America, although they tried before this.

Their goal was nothing less than to end the American Dream of free men, and eventually they were successful. Every man and woman to this day pays the exact same consequences of England's people - paying their hard earned money through taxes to the Red Shield, or should I say the Federal Reserve. Maybe taxes aren't that bad, but how does going into a recession feel?",finance

economy,A Contagion Is Spreading Through the Economy Too,"As government agencies open the floodgates for bailouts and payouts, the sober reality is the present economic crisis is only going to get worse, and is quickly “infecting” supply-chains and financial systems already severely weakened by epidemic related work-interruptions.

A prescient framework for understanding “supply-chain infection” was mapped out in 2012, in a paper by risk consultant David Korowicz, titled [Trade-Off Financial System Supply-Chain Cross-Contagion: a study in global systemic collapse](http://images.feasta.org/2012/10/Trade_Off_Korowicz.pdf).

The paper examined how the interrelated nature of the global economy can quickly lead to massive failure because of the reliance of production of goods and services on a limited number of essential but vulnerable systems—in particular in the financial and energy sectors. The financial sector has already contributed to the compromised nature of our present economy because of a constantly increasing debt-to-product ratio. In other words, the amount of actual money being lent out in the global economy far exceeds the monetary value of actual goods and services, and this is particularly bad news in crisis situations.

If major agencies default on debt payments, the credit market could quickly freeze up. Withheld letters of credit could quickly threaten basic trade, as such guarantees are used to insure the safety of transactional agreements. This would lead to severe shortages very quickly. It is possible authorities may manage to stave off such a crisis in the United States, as they just barely managed to do in 2008. But even in this optimistic scenario, it would be unreasonable to believe the fundamental problems underlying the crisis would be resolved.

Furthermore, while the mess of our financial system in crisis will be difficult for authorities to untangle, Korowicz convincingly argues that production and supply-chain relations are *even mor*e complicated. The complex interrelation of goods and services required for creating the basic necessities of life, including food, transportation and other commodities, is nearly impossible to fully map-out. One example of this complexity is that on average 15,000 individual parts are necessary to produce a single car. The loss of even one critical component for producing such an item can lead to massive interruptions, as this would result in paused production on this and all other lines requiring that component, or which require components that incorporate that critical part.

This is already starting to occur, as large scale work interruptions around the globe are creating shortages of goods. In one case, Boeing’s 787 and 767 planes require parts from a manufacturer in northern Italy. General Electric, which supplies 90% of Boeing’s engines, also requires parts from Italy. Production of [a whole series of goods has ground to a halt in Italy](https://qz.com/1815731/italys-luxury-manufacturing-is-threatened-by-coronavirus/) while the country is on lockdown due to the Coronavirus. Coupled with Boeing’s ongoing safety and reliability problems, this has pushed [the company to the point of collapse.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/17/business/economy/boeing-coronavirus-economy.html)

Korowicz convincingly argues that the highly interrelated nature of our global economy *makes it even more vulnerable to crises*. In Boeing’s case, had the company maintained its traditional vertically-integrated manufacturing strategy (i.e. primarily in-house, U.S. based production of its various components) that it abandoned in the early 2000s, it would now face less immediate fallout from the present loss of production capability in Italy. Interestingly, the company’s move towards aggressive outsourcing was not merely part of a larger global trend, but was [promoted by its partners in the U.S. military](https://www.csmonitor.com/1996/1216/121696.us.us.1.html) in the mid 1990s.

Following the [hundreds of deaths resulting from the company’s 737 Max engineering disaster](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/business/boeing-737-crashes.html), the company has tried to reverse its decades long shift away from vertical integration. However, [it has faced major obstacles in doing so](https://www.seattletimes.com/business/boeing-aerospace/boeing-experts-suppliers-talk-of-pushing-up-jet-production-while-pushing-down-costs/).

While limited shortages have already been reported for food and other supplies, breakdowns in supply chains have likely only just begun. Stores and agencies generally have a certain reserve capacity on hand for sudden interruptions in supply or for increases in demand. Right now many stores and other businesses are using such reserves to restock depleted supplies, *but this will not be tenable long-term*. It is essential to grasp the non-linear impact of a crisis. Operations will increasingly fail because of a lack of cash-flow or because of a lack of labor. Already many people laid off from jobs are worried about how they will buy food even with a mostly stable situation at supermarkets at present. Disconcertingly, if food supply chains start to crumble, Korowicz states that cities only have about a three day food supply on hand at a given moment, and that without serious pre-planning, *authorities will not be able to establish alternatives for weeks.*

Likewise, the impact from serious disruptions caused by the last several days of U.S. work stoppages will have major implications in the weeks ahead. As Korowicz states, “Pandemic modeling has shown that removing at random only small numbers of a population can cause cascading failure of functions across an economy.” He states that these failures would soon threaten to disrupt the functioning of large infrastructure such as power plants. Such pieces of infrastructure require thousands of specific parts to operate, as well as specialized skills to carry out repairs, possessed by people who may well be unable to work now because of sickness or quarantine. The impact of disruptions are magnified when they occur in a major economic power such as the United States, which provides many irreplaceable skills and services to the global economy.

Such shockwaves are likely to increase in the near future, driven by an economic system made even more vulnerable by its reliance on debt. As Korowicz states “A contracting economy is incompatible with the credit backing the global economy.”

In one example of how the pandemic crisis is already cascading into a financial crisis, New York’s Metropolitan Transportation Agency (MTA) yesterday requested [a federal bailout of $4 billion](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/17/nyregion/coronavirus-nyc-subway-federal-aid-.html). The MTA requested this nicely rounded figure based on a projected decrease of “$3.7 billion *from lost fares in the next few months*, should ridership trends continue” and for “coronavirus-specific expenses, like disinfecting subway cars and stations” estimated to reach $300 million.

These numbers do not add up.

According to the MTA’s own numbers, the agency collects about [$741 million in total fares, tolls, and advertising per month](https://new.mta.info/document/12481), meaning that the $3.7 billion figure is closer to a situation in which the number of NYC commuters *was reduced to zero for a five-month period*. And this is without even factoring in operating savings that would accrue to the MTA given reduced bus and train schedules due to future interruptions.

As the *New York Post* pointed out, the MTA is hiding its obvious debt problem. One of the MTA’s biggest expenses is simply paying back interest on a debt which is [projected to rise to $52 billion in 2023](https://nypost.com/2020/03/11/subway-riders-might-pay-for-mtas-debt-with-fare-raises-cut-service/), up from $35 billion last year. Simply paying interest on its debt approaches the total annual amount the agency pays for labor. As a result, a relatively minor immediate loss of revenue can be disastrous to the agency, making it unable to make payments to its creditors. Put another way, the agency even in normal times is barely solvent, creating a scenario in which a ripple, such as present difficulties, threatens to quickly submerge it and its financial backers, putting them beyond a point of no-return.

“The gist of it is that the risk of debt is just the same for the MTA as it is to a person,” said John Kaehny, executive director of Reinvent Albany, quoted in the Post’s article.“You can’t afford to have anything go wrong. You can’t lose your job. The MTA can’t have any setback of any kind or you won’t be able to pay off your debt.”

And the same applies to the economy on a wider scale. It is extremely vulnerable to disruption.

As Korowicz [stated in a blog post earlier this month](https://www.resilience.org/stories/2020-03-04/we-need-to-talk-about-catastrophic-global-risk/), “The government will no-doubt do everything they can to support businesses and the banking system with credit and stimulus, adding yet more debt to an already overindebted system. That will constrain future economic growth, increase the likelihood of future financial crises, and make the country less resilient to the next shock, from whatever the source. It is also straining political legitimacy, adding further uncertainty.”

In other words, the government will attempt to continue to plug up the vast numbers of holes in what amounts to a doomed ship, rather than creating a solid foundation to address the present medical and economic catastrophe.

Tellingly, as part of an apparent organizational hope within the *New York Times* that large-moves by the state and federal government can resolve the present crisis, the paper yesterday did not see fit to include any reporting about the MTA’s debt burden in its coverage of the agency’s bailout plea.

As crises continue to flare related to the pandemic, it is important to comprehend the even greater perils that may soon emerge. From Trump, to state government, to liberal critics, it seems that these risks presently are simply not being taken into consideration.

personalfinance,Math between Investing and Paying off Mortgage,"Hi everyone,

I'm having a bit of confusion as I'm trying to plan for how to use some extra money each month, and I'd like to get a second set of eyes on it.

Conventional wealth-building wisdom says to take as long as possible to pay off your mortgage and use the extra money to invest (assuming market returns &gt; interest rate, tax deductions, relative liquidity, etc). However, when I started running the numbers, the math makes it seem that paying off the mortgage quickly would actually allow me to save more in the long term.

I have $110,403.75 to save each year, so here's what I did:

**Option 1: Conventional approach:**

||**2020**|2021|2022|2023|2024|...|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Retirement|$86,403.75|$86,403.75|$86,403.75|$74,403.75|$74,403.75|...|
|House|$24,000|$24,000|$24,000|$36,000\*|$36,000|...|

.\* planning on moving to a larger house in 3 years - and not accounting for taxes/home insurance

If I plan to retire in 33 years, and assume an 8% return on investments. I calculate that I'll retire with \~$12.4M. (I used the Excel FV function to do the math on this)

&amp;#x200B;

**Option 2: Mortgage Payoff:**

||**2020**|2021|2022|2023|2024|...|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Retirement|$15,480\*|$15,480|$15,480|$15,480|$110,403.8|...|
|House|$94,923.75|$94,923.75|$94,923.75|$94,923.75|$0|...|

.\* minimum to get Employer match on 401k - still not accounting for taxes/home insurance

With the same 33 year lens and 8% return on investments. I calculate that I'll retire with \~$13.3M in this case.

So based on these calculations, I'm calculating that I'll actually save **more** by bucking the traditional approach and paying off the mortgage ASAP. So this leads to the question:

Is there something off in my math, or something I'm not accounting for that is causing these unexpected results?

personalfinance,What to do with fixed annuity 403(b)?,"I'm (30 y/o)the one in the household responsible for bills and finances generally.  My wife (30 y/o) has an American Fidelity Fixed Annuity left over from her old job.  She is and was a public school teacher, and switched districts when we moved.  This annuity is from her old job.  We both currently pay into fixed-benefit public pension systems.  

It earns an interest rate of 1.25%.  Cash value was approx $3,100 in 2018 (the last paper statement I have).

I don't know much about personal finance, but I'm trying to get better.  

It's my understanding that this investment vehicle has restricted uses.  We couldn't withdraw it to pay off debts (which we have) without suffering a big penalty.  I think it's probably the best for us to transfer it into a Vanguard Target Retirement Fund, since this type of fund balances allocation automatically and should earn more over time than the current pitiful interest rate.  I believe this firm also typically offers very low fees, which can cannibalize earnings over time.

Bitcoin,Stock Buybacks implications for bitcoin,"Lots of talk that government will restrict stock buybacks in the Coronavirus bailout bills. Just to briefly review, companies use their profits to buy back their own stock to reduce the number of shares outstanding. This results in their earnings going up without actually growing their profits. I call this the scam of the stock market.

This practice has greatly contributed to a rising stock market. Imagine this practice ending! The result would be a stock market that doesn’t rise as it has in the past. Companies who could actually grow their earnings would do fine but this is not most companies. This would further result in the stock market not making new highs for decades. Think Japan millennials! And forget a quick stock market bounce back.

Bitcoin’s big drop recently was because big players wanted to raise cash quickly. Bitcoin helped with this because it trades 24/7. Not closed on weekends. No emergency trading halts. 

All the talk about bitcoin not being a safe haven is nonsense. In fact, bitcoin has risen 70% from its recent low. I think this will continue and bitcoin should pass its all time high probably this year. That’s not the case with the stock market. Consider the case of bitcoin hitting an all-time high and the stock market still way down. How do we say FOMO?

Even the Fed with their trillion dollar injections is not going to be able to save the stock market. Negative interest rates are just around the corner. This is another great thing for bitcoin.

Made about 100k in 3 weeks from this.

Anyways, have a lot of chat requests and questions in my DM so I figured I'd put thoughts. (I have some DD as a post on my profile you can check too)

Basically I expect the market to have a slower ride down, '08 style. However, there's still another &gt;15% drop to go. 

Feds are doing their best to fix the incoming credit crunch (with literally trillions) but with the shortage of USD in the world (eurodollar!) and globally weakening currencies, I think they can only slow the drop downwards.

This implies that there are no safe bets. Cash, equity, bond, gold are all going to drop if the credit bubble pops. All this repo, injected liquidity, helicopter money are really to stop defaults. Because if the lenders (read: banks) fall, the rest of the world will too.

If we start getting defaults, you're going to see the market tank again. Corporations are already getting downgraded by the dozens.

Remember the drop isn't because of coronavirus. This is a common misinderstanding. It's actually because of the credit bubble.

This crisis is different from 08 in *sheer magnitude* though. I fully expect 2020s crash to hit harder than 08.

economy,The federal government needs to give every american a payment card(if they are going to distribute money),"Instead of giving a check and taking the time to figure out what the amount needs to be. The treasury should immediately send everyone a payment card(like a credit/debit card) a certain amount that is given like the $1000 tax free and then apply for more if applicable. They could even make it so you can spend a certain amount at grocery stores like EBT cards modern day food stamps but you could also pay bills with it like utilities, rent, and medical bills and certain amount only could take out as cash.

Im not sure how they would choose to give it too but would be similar to how they would do the same when deciding who to give out the checks to. I'd imagine this would save money on sending out the money. Also could make this a permanent thing were this is where you get your tax refunds and social security payments and any other government subsidy. *Side note: The IRS should put out a free tool to do your taxes online. The tax prep companies* *~~bribed~~* *lobbied and contributed to politicians campaign to prevent this.  Most peoples taxes are not special and do not need anyone to go over it.* Also could put this as part of UBI and medicare for all.

Only thing I wonder about is if people are made to stay home how is this money going to circulate other than online transactions. Also I wonder what the effect on inflation is.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

For those against this why do corporations that are extremely profitable get bailed out? Normally this people can pay their bills. Also all we need to do is cut back on a small percentage from the DoD. We need to run an audit to see what is being wasted and over charged for. There are plenty of stories of people told by commanders to burn through supplies like ammo so they will use their budget so they do not get cut. And if we have to bail out the banks (as well as any company that is a monopoly) again they should be nationalized. Normally when you pay off someone's debts you own it. There are many types of combined public and private businesses/corps. Also nationalize or get rid of the fed. The treasury, our government should have complete control of our currency which means rep all profits as well and implement full reserve banking. This would end the business cycle. As money is created through this legal fraud loans the money could be injected into the economy from the UBI. This would have a strong economy during normal times since would have very high money circulation. Im sure my ideas arent perfect cuz its much more complex but I know many of these things are problems except for the elites and one of the ways they keep their power.",finance

So wife and I are in this boat (all of the loans are hers).     To make it short. She works for VA so she should be eligible for forgiveness since the VA is a federal, state or local public service job, after she works there for 10 years and makes 120 payments and her loans are all consolidated into federal loans (i forget the word). We have already done all that and did a good amount of research before starting down this path. We calculated that it would be worth it to go down this path with her loan amount. At this point we are 5 years into it. 

But Dave full heartedly doesn’t believe in it and quotes that the people getting rejected are people that didn’t make correct number of payments, don’t have the correct loan types, didn’t work for a public service job etc. which is why they are getting denied.

personalfinance,Buying a Chevy Bolt EV,"Okay, I want to buy a new car, tell me I’m dumb please. 

I can purchase a Chevy Bolt EV (electric car), that I’m confident will cover all my driving needs, for about $24500. Less my fully paid of 2016 Mazda3 with 50k miles conservative trade in value of 10k, plus state sales taxes, and let’s say $300 in various fees, I’d be out $15706. There is still a state rebate of $2500 and federal of $1875 so let’s subtract those and were at $11331. GM is offering 84 months interest free loan so that’s $134 / month. I can charge for free at work everyday, I’ll never have to do any oil change or break job again and I won’t be spending $80-$110 in gas a month. The increase to insurance is marginal. Also I researched batteries for my PhD and wanted an EV for ages.

I guess the counter argument is I don’t have to spend $11331 for my car as it’s already paid for. Also I’ve only had my car 2 years (bought it CPO) but put 33k miles on it and would be down ~6k in depreciation including taxes.

Me and my wife have credit card and medical debt that we've made good progress on before this whole thing happened. So we've got some living space left under our credit limit now.

I'm figuring that to keep us under a roof and the kids fed, we should use our credit card for any purchases/bills that can be put on credit, and save our cash reserves for the cash only stuff (like rent). That way we can stretch out the whole having-roof-and-food situation out as long as possible. If we run out or credit, we can burn through cash to make rent; we can't burn through credit to do the same if we run out of cash.

I have enough money in my savings account to completely pay off the loan and also still have an emergency 6 month safety net left over after which should sustain me until the end of my lease.

My plan all along has been to pay off the loan to get the monthly 350 payment off my back and then relax a bit. Take time off work, maybe move to cheaper cost of living area, maybe change fields entirely. I've been working a fairly stressful job that has caused me to feel a bit burnt out lately. I'm extremely grateful for my job and I am happy with the pay but right now the only reason I continue to stay is because I want the money to pay off this loan. 

So my question is, would it be smart to completely pay off this loan now? Or should I wait and see what happens? Who knows what the US will look like even two months from now so part of me feels like it may be wise to wait until the economy and the coronavirus situation stabilizes a bit.

During wars, governments pass laws that they couldn't pass during peacetime. During WW2 income tax was [expanded](https://time.com/4289687/1942-tax-day-history/) to take our sweet tendies from us.

This is a [war](https://time.com/5806657/donald-trump-coronavirus-war-china/) and trump is willing to pass any law to get elected.

While UBI gained through taxes shouldn't [cause inflation](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/9/20/16256240/mexico-cash-transfer-inflation-basic-income), [helicopter money](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/helicopter-drop.asp) causes inflation. Our government is [broke](https://twitter.com/TruthGundlach/status/1241154891134857216) so they're definitely printing this shit.

&amp;#x200B;

\***Supply Chain Disruption**\*

The coronavirus is pushing our supply chain [to the edge](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/03/supply-chains-and-coronavirus/608329/).

\***Why no calls**?\*

When inflation happens calls might look like a good idea, however my prediction is that gold will grow at a faster rate than other stocks due to inflation (and be losing money after inflation adjustments).

&amp;#x200B;

\***When?**\*

It's time to invest more money in gold when these two things happen.

1. When [helicopter money](https://twitter.com/TruthGundlach/status/1241154891134857216) starts getting real serious.
2. The [dollar index](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/dxy/charts) chart, specifically once we pass helicopter money laws. We're at all time highs now, the peak is nigh.

My guess is in 2-4 weeks.

personalfinance,Taking out student loan debt - what steps can I take to best prepare myself for this commitment?,"Hi all,

Per the title, I'll be taking out roughly 200k in student loan debt in August to pursue a law degree at a T14&lt;x&lt;T30 US law school. I know this is the path I want to pursue, so I'm looking for resources to better prepare myself for what 200k of federal loans entails.

**Loan Details**

* $61,500 - Federal Direct Unsubsidized Stafford Loans (6.08% interest)
* $145,320 - Federal Direct GradPLUS Loans (7.08% interest)

**Current Circumstances**

* No debt
* No significant savings (&lt;$1000)
* No assets
* Working full-time, net $3000/mo for the next 4 months (expected savings of $10,000 by August)

# Future Scenarios

* **PSLF**
   * My 'dream job' is working in federal government, so this would be the ideal route for me. As I understand it, I'd pay 120 minimum payments toward the debt (scaled to my income), after which the remaining debt would be forgiven (without incurring a 'tax bomb' that other forgiveness programs entail).
   * Cons of this approach include eligibility, uncertainty of the program (under the current administration), and the program's high rejection rate (due to mismanagement when it was founded)
* **Private Practice (Big Law, etc.)**
   * I could see a future where I accept a more high-paying job of interest to pay off the loan. That said, I'm well aware of the bimodal distribution of law grad salaries and the difficulty of entering Big Law without a T14 degree. Employment outcomes from my school suggest that the median salary of graduates entering private practice is $160k, though I recognize that this figure is skewed by % reporting.
   * **Assuming** a salary of **140k** (net $8,740/mo) upon graduating, I'd be looking at the following outcomes per loan repayment plan:
      * Standard 10-Year Loan Repayment Plan: ($2,623 loan repayment) + ($2,225 housing) = $3,892 net/mo
      * Standard 25-Year Loan Repayment Plan: ($1,638 loan repayment) + ($2,225 housing) = $4,877 net/mo
* **10% IBR (20 years)**
   * Lastly, I could see a scenario where I find a government job but don't qualify for PSLF, at which point I'd anticipate $60k/yr gross salary and pay off the loan with an income-based plan:
      * ($500 loan repayment) + ($2,225 housing) = $1,361 net/mo

Please let me know what other scenarios might exist (even if it's ""don't take out 200k in loans""), and I'd appreciate any resources, books, blogs, etc., that may help. Finance is definitely not my area of expertise. My goal is to be as prepared as possible for when I need to actually start making payments on the loans (late 2023).

*****
&gt; Markets face more violent swings in the coming week as investors watch out for a rising number of coronavirus cases and new data that could show how the virus is slamming the U.S. economy.
*****
&gt; The past week was brutal for stock investors with the Dow Jones Industrial Average posting a 17.3% decline, its worst week since October 2008. But it was the stressed-out credit markets that were at the vortex of pain with a standstill in corporate paper and spreads widening in all areas, from corporates to mortgages.
*****
&gt; As economists looked for an even sharper economic downturn from the impact of social distancing, the Federal Reserve in the past week continued to fire away with new programs and liquidity to grease the wheels of nervous markets. By Friday, the dollar stopped its surge, and the Treasury market was a little calmer, with the benchmark 10-year yields sliding under 1% after a wild ride higher earlier in the week.
*****
&gt; “The Fed is buying about $70 billion in off-the-run Treasurys today. That brings their total purchases this week to $300 billion,” said Patrick Leary, chief market strategist at Incapital, on Friday. ”$160 billion was the highest we saw in any week during the financial crisis.”

&gt; Consumer sentiment will be important when it is released Friday, but the big tell for the economy will be unemployment claims on Thursday, which are expected to show the impact of massive layoffs at restaurants, stores and other businesses that were forced to close or reduce activity to prevent the spread of the virus.
*****
&gt; Claims rose by 33% in the past week to 281,000, an unprecedented jump outside of times of natural disasters like hurricanes. Some strategists say the claims could easily jump to 1 million or more.
*****
&gt; “We’re going to start to see the magnitude of the coronavirus impact on the economy. We already started to see some of it in the weekly claims and now we’re going to get a clearer picture,” said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors. Arone said he’s watching the PMI data. “This data is going to inform us how bad it could get, give us some guidance, some rough rules of the road. Right now, it’s sell first, ask questions later.”
*****
&gt; Economists increasingly expect a very sharp but quick recession, starting now. Goldman Sachs economists expect a shocking 24% contraction in second quarter gross domestic product after a 6% decline in the first quarter. The economists expect unemployment to shoot up to 9% from 3.5%, but they see a rebound with growth at 12% in the third quarter.
*****
&gt; “I expect that we’ll see abnormal volatility in markets until we begin to see that infection curve flatten, or we see some type of health remedy, vaccine or some solution. I don’t think we’re going to see that in the next few weeks at least,” said Arone. As of Friday, there were about 14,200 cases of the virus in the U.S.
*****
&gt; # More Fed Artillery
&gt; Leary and others believe there is more room for the Fed to expand its arsenal, and that could include corporate debt purchases. Investment grade corporate debt funds and exchange traded funds saw record outflows of nearly $44 billion in the last week, according to Bank of America.
*****
&gt; The Fed has already slashed interest rates to zero, added $1 trillion in daily repo operations, and created facilities to help commercial paper, money markets and municipal debt. The dollar has rocketed higher since March 9, and the Fed also expanded swap lines with other central banks, which helped stop the dollar’s run on Friday.
*****
&gt; As the world’s reserve currency, companies, investors, banks and other institutions worldwide are looking to raise cash and they want it in dollars, the safest, most liquid currency. That rapid move to cash put a strain on the foreign exchange market, and sent the dollar higher and other currencies sharply lower.
*****
&gt; “I think the market is going to be looking for indications that there’s some sort of stabilization, or maybe even a hint of stabilization and that policy makers are taking the right action. I think we’re not yet at that cathartic moment of peak pessimism,” said Ben Randol, foreign exchange strategist at Bank of America. “I’m watching what’s going to happen over the weekend because some pretty big numbers [of new virus cases] could come out, not just in the U.S. but in other countries.”
*****
&gt; # ‘Liquidity infinity’
&gt; Strategists say it would not be surprising to see more Fed policy moves next week, and a big fiscal stimulus package is expected to come up in Congress on Monday, to ease the impact of job losses on individuals and help companies weather the downturn.
*****
&gt; John Briggs, head of strategy at NatWest Markets, said the bond market responded to the Fed’s actions to make more dollars available, seeming to slow the sale of Treasurys by those parties looking to raise cash. “Things are settling into ranges Friday afternoon, because we can’t take it anymore,” he said.
*****
&gt; “The amount of policy thrown at this market was staggering ... Liquidity infiinity is what I’m calling it,” he said. “By the weekend, the whole country is literally going to be shut . You have claims at state unemployment offices skyrocketing. What’s the good news over the weekend? That they’re going to pass this bill? That’s already in the price.”

# How Markets Bottom

&gt; With US equities firmly in a bear market, even the most long-term investors are now looking ahead to when the selling may stop and where the S&amp;P 500 Index might ultimately bottom. “Nobody knows exactly how this market bottom will play out,” said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “However, using history as guide, we know markets tend to retest or even slightly break previous lows.”

&gt; We took a look at how markets have bottomed for two previous bear markets that show similarities to the current sell-off, in terms of speed and magnitude. As shown in the chart below, following Black Monday, the largest single-day decline in the history of the S&amp;P 500, the index rebounded modestly, before undercutting its lows about six weeks later. However, a look at the bottom panel shows that the momentum, or speed, of that move was significantly less extreme and markets went on to rally, ultimately eclipsing the 1987 peak less than two years later.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Technical-1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; The 2008-2009 financial crisis tells a similar story. While the S&amp;P 500 Index didn’t ultimately reach its low until March 2009, most stocks actually bottomed during the fall 2008, following the collapse of Lehman Brothers. Even though the S&amp;P 500 undercut the October lows by a full 10%, this divergence, similar to the momentum observed in 1987, shows that things were improving under the surface even if the price of the index didn’t yet reflect it.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Technical-2.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; It may be too early to say that the initial leg of our current decline is done, but certainly we have seen extreme fear and a historic decline in markets. One positive—the S&amp;P 500 has yet to close below its December 2018 lows. Soon it may be time to start hunting for signs of a bottom.

*****

# Stocks Approach 2009 Valuations vs. Bonds

&gt; We rolled out our Road to Recovery Playbook at the start of the week to help investors gauge where the market is in its bottoming process. The first and most important piece of that playbook—visibility into a peak in new COVID-19 cases—remains elusive, but we hope to have a clearer picture with the next couple of weeks as containment efforts have more time to work. We continue to monitor cases daily and plan to update you on that progress regularly during this crisis.

&gt; We’re getting closer to checking off the other four boxes. We would just like to see a bit more economic data consistent with recession—almost surely coming soon—and to get more clarity on the timing, size, and nature of the policy response before checking off those two boxes on our list. The technical analysis and sentiment box was checked last week—the amount of bearishness among investors is near the levels of prior bear market lows.

&gt; The last box—markets pricing in recession—was also checked last week based on the magnitude of the sell-off. The nearly 30% drop in the S&amp;P 500 Index from the February 19 high is close to the average peak-to-trough decline in recessions at about 35%.

&gt; Another way to show a recession is priced in and stocks may be near their ultimate bottom is by valuing stocks relative to bonds, sometimes called the equity risk premium (ERP), which we show in the LPL Chart of the Day.

&gt; “Stocks are now historically cheap by most measures after this selloff,” noted LPL Chief Investment Officer Burt White. “When comparing stock valuations to bond yields, we are approaching levels only seen during some of the worst bear markets over the past 50 years.”

&gt; The equity risk premium compares the earnings yield on the S&amp;P 500 (the inverse of the price-to-earnings ratio) to the 10-year US Treasury yield. That number as of March 18 was 4.9%, well above the long-term average of 0.8% (it was higher on March 16 when the 10-year Treasury yield was 0.73% rather than 1.18%). That compares to historical peaks between 6 and 7% in 1974 and shortly after the financial crisis.

&gt; The bottom line is that if this trend holds equity investors could be well compensated over time for the risks they are taking now.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ERP-blog-chart-3-19-20-revised-disclosure-v2.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; We know it’s tough to see the other side of this crisis right now, and the volatility is unnerving for all of us. But historically, investors who owned stocks at these valuations have been rewarded over time. We think this time will be no different.

# How Quickly Can Stocks Recover From COVID-19?

&gt; The market volatility continues, as the S&amp;P 500 Index has closed either up or down 4% or more for a record 7 consecutive days. With the S&amp;P 500 Index down 30% from the highs, it has officially moved into a bear market. Yesterday, we took a look at how stocks did after the lows of major corrections formed, and today we’ll take another angle on this.

&gt; We do not know if down 30% is the lows; in fact, it probably isn’t. The good news is we feel we are getting close to a major low. How quickly could stocks regain their February 19 highs? “Historically we’ve found that some of the quickest market sell-offs can lead to some of the fastest recoveries,” explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “That’s the good news. The bad news is if the economy falls into a recession, it can take longer.”

&gt; As the LPL Chart of the Day shows, there have been 14 previous bear markets since 1950, and it took an average of 20 months from the bear market lows to recover the losses*. Taking this a step further, when the economy avoided a recession, the recovery took only 10 months, versus 30 months for a recession, although a lot of that is because bear markets accompanied by recessions are typically deeper. Last, the last three bear markets that avoided a recession recovered the gains in 3 months, 4 months, and 4 months after the ultimate bear lows were made.

# Looking To The Other Side of The Bear

&gt; The indiscriminate selling continued yesterday, with one of the worst days in stock market history. Fears over the potential impact of COVID-19 (coronavirus) have led to one of the steepest sell-offs in history, rivaling what we saw in 1962 and 1987.

&gt; With the S&amp;P 500 Index down 30% from the all-time highs set less than a month ago on February 19, it is quite clear the stock market is voting on a significant economic slowdown over the coming months. Historically, during bear markets we have found that stocks pulled back 37% on average during a recession and 24% on average if a recession is avoided. With stocks currently down right near the middle of this, the economy could be about a coin flip to going into a recession or not. We discuss this idea and more in our latest LPL Market Signals Podcast.

&gt; What happens next? “Clearly no one knows how bad things could get and when stocks will ultimately bottom, but we feel we are getting close,” explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “The good news is a year after previous market corrections end, as scary as they all felt at the time, stock performance has historically been quite strong, higher more than 90% of the time.”

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, since 1980, there have been 31 other 10% corrections or more for the S&amp;P 500, according to data from our friends at Ned Davis Research. We’d like to stress, we don’t know when this weakness will end, but if we are close, the average return after a correction ends has been more than 23% on average and higher more than 90% of the time.

# COVID-19 Collapse vs. Other Major Downturns

&gt; Even though equities rose today, the S&amp;P 500 still remains over 28% off of the 2/19 high. As of yesterday's close, only twenty days after the S&amp;P 500's peak, the index was down nearly 32% from that high. Below is a look at the current selloff from its high versus prior big selloffs since 1928. We all know about the 1929 and 1987 market crashes, but this one has even those beat in terms of the time it took to fall this much. And the two major peaks and subsequent bear markets of the 21st century both took basically a year to fall the same amount that we've fallen in just 20 trading days this time.

# Oil Slippery

&gt; Like a flopping wet fish, it's been incredibly hard to get a hold on an accurate price of crude oil this week. With a gain of 22.2% so far today, WTI is experiencing its largest one-day gain on record (dating back to 1983). The next closest largest one-day gain was in December 2008 when crude rallied 17.8%. While today's gain is impressive, keep in mind that it followed yesterday's decline of 24.4% which ranks as the third-largest one-day decline on record and last week's 24.6% decline on March 9th. In fact, three of the four largest one-day percentage moves in WTI have all come in the last two weeks!

&gt; While a big gain in any asset class always leads to questions over whether it is the start of a new run higher, we would caution that following the prior nine largest one-day gains on record, crude oil's median change over the next week was a decline of 4.4%.

# Russell 2000's Third Largest Drawdown on Record

&gt; While US large cap stocks are right around 30% from their record highs a month ago, the carnage in small caps has been even more severe. While the Russell 2000 never quite made a new high this year along with the broader market, it got pretty close. Like the rest of the market, though, it has been crushed. As of yesterday's close, the Russell 2000 was 43.1% below its all-time high which ranks as the third-largest decline from a record high. The only two periods where the Russell saw a larger decline were in October 2002 when the drawdown reached 46.1% and then in March 2009 when the selling finally stopped at 59.9% on March 9, 2009. Now, if the Russell 2000 were to match either of those prior two periods in terms of magnitude, it would have to fall an additional 4.3% to match the decline of October 2002 or 28.9% to match the decline of March 2009.

# The Buck's Bounce

&gt; In the currency space, the US dollar has certainly not been immune from recent market volatility. The dollar index peaked on February 20th, just one day after the S&amp;P 500 had reached its all time highs. That was the dollar's highest level since April of 2017. Over the following days, the dollar would go on to fall roughly 5% to its low on March 9th. In the time since then, it has more than recovered those losses, rising over 6% and is once again back up to its highest levels since 2017.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/031820-.png))**

&gt; This string of volatility for the greenback is rare. As of today, the dollar is up 4.26% over the past ten days. But just back on the ninth (the recent low) it had been lower by 4.12% over the prior ten days. The last time that there was both a 10-day change up and down of at least 4% in the span of just ten days was back in October of 2008. Going back through the index's history since the early 1970s, there have been a total of 15 days (including that 2008 and current instances) in which such swings can be observed; shown by the red dots in the chart below. Prior to 2008, the only other times the dollar was as volatile by this measure was in the 1980s and late 1970s. So with regards to more recent history, it is even more unprecedented.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/031820-10-Day-Change.png))**

&gt; In terms of daily changes, the dollar has also been very volatile. Over the past ten days, the currency has averaged a daily change (positive or negative) of just over 1% which is rare going back through history. Again this is the most volatile the dollar has been since the financial crisis, though at that time, the daily swings were larger on average; reaching 1.35% at the high. Prior to 2008, the only other times the average daily change was over 1% was in the early 1990s, mid-1980s, and late 1970s. As with 2008, those past times were slightly more volatile than the current moment.

stocks,Invest or pay down debt ?,# Hello everyone. I could use some advice. I have about 35k in student loans and I have about 11k in a pension account ( I am an English teacher overseas and it's a bit of a pain to cash out the pension ) . Do you guys think it would be wise to cash out the pension and put some of that money into the market at this time? My interest rate on my loan is around 5%. I know in most cases it's better to just pay off the loan but with the market tanking this could be a great chance to invest. Thoughts?,finance
personalfinance,Considering taking out a loan with a lower interest rate to pay of a loan with a higher interest rate. Good idea? Any drawbacks?,Someone recently told me about how our credit union is offering loans at 4% while I have student loans at or above 5%. Could I just take out a loan with a lower rate to pay off the higher ones? Is there a flaw in my logic?,finance
personalfinance,"Looking to refinance my mortgage, now not sure if I can afford it with new expenses.","Due to the bump interest rate cuts, I looked into refinancing my current mortgage into a 15 year.

Current: 330k owed, 30 year, 4%

Refinance: 339k, 15 year, 2.625%

From the current loan estimates, it looks like my monthly payment will go up $500, from 2.5 to 3k/month. Now I locked this in hurriedly as all of the bankers were saying that rates would most likely increase (which they in fact did.) As of this moment things have changed and we are expecting baby one on the way and I'm not really sure of the real financial impact of this. Currently doing alright at 2.5k, making contributions to retirement accounts, not too much additional savings after that.

Wondering if I should have gotten a 30 year rate quote in the beginning, and just tried to pay it down as soon as I could to give me the flexibility? As of right now, it doesn't look like the current 30 year rates would be worth it to refinance, so I would just go with my original loan.

Household income at $115k/year, 12k in Roth IRA/year, 19k in 401k/year",finance
personalfinance,What am I missing from the 401k concept?,"I am looking at the 401k concept without employee matching. I was under the impression that the power of a 401k is in the compounding interest effect:   
Let's say I'm saving $2,000 per year for 30years at an avg interest rate of 6% per year and auto re-investment. In year 30 I will end up with approx. $144,000.   
If I were to do the same pre-tax and my tax bracket is 25%, that means I put away $2,500 each year, I will end up with 180,000 (25% more), nothing special. After 30 years, when I start withdrawing 8% (I still make 6% each year on the remaining money), I will end up with $98,000 in my 401k vs $78,000 without 401k. Which is 25% more in my 401k. 

Additionally, the 401k is tax-deferred not tax free, so I only benefit from it if I am in a lower tax bracket when I retire than now, in other words, if I retire poor. 

Another addition is the fees, they seem higher than if I just put it in a low cost index fund?   

So what am I missing here?",finance

retirement,59 Retired for 2.5 yrs / Down 21% :-O,"I've always ignored past crashes but this time, having just entered my 3rd year of retirement, it's hard to ignore.

At the time of the crash my equity allocation was about 49% (all funds), my bond funds allocation was 40% and the rest was cash and alternatives.

My high yield muni bond fund (NHMAX) has dropped over 14% this month, I'm deep in the red there, thousands of $$$.  All my bond funds have dropped.  They are taking hits almost as much as my equity funds.

I have no pension, social security will start when I'm 67, so I am living off my portfolio.  I've got about 2 years of living expenses in cash-equivalent non-retirement accounts.  **I'm starting to wonder if 2 years is enough at this point**, given the estimates that the next 2 quarters could be bad and no vaccine is available or will be for 18 months or so.

**Should I sell some of the NHMAX muni bond fund even though it's taken such a big hit, and redeploy into equities, or continue to let it ride in NHMAX?**  That fund is 13% of my total portfolio.  It's interest rate has dropped to a net yield of 2.84%.  That's not nearly as troubling as seeing that muni bond balance drop by &gt;14%.",finance

personalfinance,Can 529 plan be used to pay Student Loans that have been refinanced with a private lender?,"I refinanced my private student loans with a private lender (First Republic).  I still get a 1098-E Student Loan Interest statement each year which I use to get a deduction on my taxes.  I'm aware that with the Secure Act of 2019 I can open a 529 naming myself as a beneficiary and use the funds in that account to pay off up to $10,000 of qualifying student loans.  My question is, since I refinanced my student loans with a private lender, is that refinanced loan, which I still receive 1098-E statements on, considered a **qualifying student loan** for the purpose of repayment using 529 funds?

If so my plan would be to contribute about $5,000 and let it ride in the stock market, come back in 4-5 years and hopefully have a gain and withdraw it all tax free to use to pay toward my student loans (which won't be paid off yet since I have about 8 years left on it and the balance far exceeds $5,000).  The idea would be that stocks are really cheap right now, likely to recover in the next 4-5 years (it's a gamble I know), the gains would be tax free (state and federal) and I can withdraw the entire amount tax free any time.",finance

Is there a way to do this without doing like a cash advance (because of their very high interest rates)?

I’m really fortunate to be in the situation given the current environment. This is my first time posting so forgive me if I mess something up!

I’m a cadet that’s a senior at a service academy and we qualify for a personal loan of $36,000 at a low interest rate of 0.75% through a trusted bank. I haven’t taken the loan out earlier when we qualify because I did not think I needed it. However, given the stock market I believe that I’m in a very unique position to take advantage of it. 

I will begin to pay off this loan over a span of five years after 90 days of commissioning date. I have budgeted it based off my pay grade when I commission and spoke to past graduates who have taken the loan. They said it was fairly easy to make payments, etc. I don’t foresee any big issues paying it off. I will commission soon as a pilot. I have a guaranteed job and no debt of any kind. 

I have already put some of my own savings towards a Roth IRA for 2019 and have not contributed to my 2020 Roth IRA yet. Any advice would greatly be appreciated. Thank you!",finance
personalfinance,"Law student with small credit card debt, lost future income, need advice","I live in Michigan, USA. 

I am finishing my 1st year of law school currently (virtually because of COVID 19). I am on a 2/3 tuition scholarship, and my school is affordable, so I am taking out very little student loans each year, all in the form of federal Unsubsidized. This means around 13k each year, for 3 years (so WAY less than many students pay for law school). 

I have a part time job that pays about 1400 a month with very low hours.  I’m a contractor, and they don’t have any work for me now so that income is gone for the foreseeable future. 

I have very little in savings (that will likely all go to what I’ll owe in taxes for the few months I was a contractor employee at the end of 2019). 

My fiancé, who I live with, thankfully has a very essential job and we aren’t worried about his job security at all.  He pays for living expenses right now so really I would be fine (in terms of living) if all my income is lost. 

I have less than $3k on my credit card, but my APR is at 23% variable.  

My question:  assuming I can, should I take out an extra $3k in student loans to pay off my credit card so that I don’t have to worry about paying that down slowly as we enter a recession?  

I don’t want to ask my partner since he is financially supporting me so much already, and I’m the idiot who has credit card debt to begin with. 

I am not great with personal finance and would like any advice on how to not screw myself over going forward.  I thought I would have my credit card paid off by summer,  but clearly my plans are having to adjust for this pandemic.",finance

personalfinance,I'm on full financial aid and can't afford to pay taxes on my aid.,"Hello,

I'm a freshman in college and am receiving full financial aid. 

I had no idea nor the time needed to file my taxes independently because it was my first time dealing with scholarships and I had four jobs during 2019 (two concurrent part-time jobs before moving to college and two concurrent part-time jobs at college in a different state), so I used H&amp;R Block to make sure that I didn't mess anything up. They included my room and board aid (around 18k) as income, which means I have to pay back taxes on that. All-in-all, I have to pay just under 4k in federal and state taxes for money that I never had access to. 

Because of COVID-19 I'm getting a room and board refund that's just enough to pay off my taxes this year, but I legitimately don't know what I'm going to do in the next few years at school. I talked with upperclassmen and the ones on full aid all said that they've never filed their scholarships as income, so should I just file them myself and do the same? Should I take out loans to pay taxes? I definitely can't pick up another job to pay taxes due to time constraints and I don't make enough annually at the jobs I'm currently working to pay 4k in taxes each year on top of my other fixed expenses. Any advice?

investing,Will we see a surge in insurance company bankruptcies?,"1.Business interruption insurance

Many businesses enroll in business interruption insurance which pays out in the event of a natural disaster or if a company is forced to close. Some will cover up to a year of employee salaries. While some plans don't cover pandemics, some do. If businesses are forced to close across the country for months via government mandate, will we see the ones that don't exclude pandemics go under?

2.Health insurance

With more people sick and needing to be hospitalized, some in intensive care, would this cause an excess of claims?

3.Life Insurance

If this kills several million in the span of a year in the worst case scenario, can companies survive this?

And if these companies fail, do you think the federal government will bail them out?

On top of the surge in claims, will the rapid decline in asset values exacerbate this? Treasuries are likely safe, but ""Investment grade"" corporate bonds may see a surge in defaults if businesses are closed for months.

personalfinance,Invest money for down-payment in bond funds or keep in bank?,"I have started saving money for paying a down-payment on a house about 5 years from now. By my estimate, I'll need around 80-100k for the 20% down-payment. I have a fully funded emergency fund, already maxed Roth IRA, and have put in the majority of money for 2020 into my 401k already, and will max it out by the end of the year.

The money I have saved for the down payment is sitting in a HYSA right now. With the rates almost definitely going down close to 0 in the near future, should I put that money into a bond fund, or do I keep it in the HYSA? Any other option I should be looking at?

To give some numbers: 10k in e-fund in a separate HYSA. 22k in CD's that I opened last year, varying maturity dates and interest rates from like 2.8-3.4%. Another 22k in a HYSA giving 4% interest, but I expect that to go away in the next month or two with the current zero interest environment.",finance

personalfinance,Just got married - what are some good ways to organize finances?,"Got married last week and my wife and I have been talking about how we should go about organizing our finances.

We want to have a joint account for all communal expenses and this likely would come with a communal credit card or something to that effect. We also want to maintain some sort of separation so that we each have a stash of money that we can use for whatever we want (been calling it our fun money).

This is less a *should we do this* post but more a what is the best way to go about accomplishing what we want.

She has a mortgage through Wells Fargo and we both have accounts with them. I’ve also got accounts with USAA and Navy Federal Credit Union (which I’ll get her set up with as well). I know that WF is bad, but living in CA it is pretty convenient having them all around, and essentially having the mortgage paired with the bank account. I’m open to using a different bank as a primary savings account but I don’t really want us to be in a situation where we’ve got a slew of accounts that were having to split money between and manage/monitor.

A rough idea of organization that I’ve thought of but haven’t decided on was:
-	open account with Ally as primary holding for savings
-	each keep our accounts with WF (her for mortgage reasons, both for ease of cash access) - I feel like at this point we could just stop using our saving accounts with WF or keep $1K in them just in case, but ultimately not really rely on them
-	I’ll keep my USAA because my car payment is through them and so is my insurance (and soon so will my wife’s - car and homeowner) - this is where I’d keep my fun money more than likely just so it’s separate from everything and easy to see exactly what I’ve got
-	I’ve got an Apple Card and I think that will become my fun money card

What would be a good card to use as a communal card that we both use for “us” purchases (home repairs, groceries, eating out, etc.)

Let me know if you need more information to provide meaningful advice and I’ll do my best to get it to you.

personalfinance,Just sold a house. Can I open two high interest savings accounts at once to store the money?,"Hello. Had a question for my mom. She’s 63, no retirement savings, so really reliant on the money that just came into her account from the sale of her house ($314k). End plan is to use about 200k of it toward the purchase of a new place (right now she’s renting, though she also currently works, so the money isn’t really being touched much). 

She doesn’t want to do anything risky like invest in the stock market, or even things that aren’t that risky (bonds, CDs). I thought it’d be a good idea to find savings accounts with good interest rates, because right now the full sum is sitting in a bank account that makes little interest. I looked it up online and am finding that the best interest rates (in banks we’ve heard of, like Capital One and Discover) is 1.5%. Given that the FDIC insures up to 250k per bank, I was thinking to have her put around 240k in Capital One, and then the remaining 74k into discover. That way she’d be accumulating as much interest as possible simultaneously.

For someone who wants to totally avoid risk, does this sound like a good plan? She’s even paranoid about using Discover since they don’t have any branch locations, but I told her it’s just as safe. She’s a little nervous that there will be some kind of glitch and she’ll lose everything. 

Also, does opening two savings accounts at once impact credit at all? Is there anything I’m not considering?",finance

Turbotax's website seems to imply that they can't change it and we have to talk to the tax boards directly (state and fed both).

**EDIT**: Thanks for the useful advice and tips! Solved!  So if you already filed taxes and scheduled your taxes to be withdrawn in April and want to change the date to July, here is what I just did and it worked:

I ended up calling EFTPS 1-800-353-4537. They are open 24/7 were able to cancel my upcoming payment easily and quickly. When you call you must have both your SSN or tax ID and your EXACT amount of federal tax due. (That last one caught me offguard.)

1. Log back in to EFTPS [https://www.eftps.gov/](https://www.eftps.gov/) and make an account.  Wait 2 days. Then schedue a payment for later.

OR

2. go to  [https://www.irs.gov/payments](https://www.irs.gov/payments) about a month before I want to pay and set up payment then. (Can't do it more than 30 days in advance though)

Lastly this only takes care of federal taxes. State taxes are my next problem. But I don't owe much state tax.",finance

personalfinance,$15k (USD) in credit card debt looking for best way to pay it off,"Hi everyone,

I'm trying to figure out the best way to handle my credit card debt. My monthly minimum payments are not making a dent.

My current plan is to use the snowball method. 

I plan on finishing paying off my car by next week. 

I then plan on putting my former monthly car payments towards my student loan 2 which should wrap it up by November 2020 latest.

That will free up $621/month which I can use to add to my student loan 1 payments and pay it off by March 2021.

This would free up $900/month that I can use towards the credit card debt.

The interest rate on the card is so high that I'm considering taking a personal loan to bring the rate down or possibly a 0% intro apr card that can buy me room until I am able to hunker down and pay it off. It currently feels like I'm burning money making payments towards it.

Will a 0% intro apr card cover the $15k credit amount? Is there a way to find out in advance if it will?


As far as the personal loan what's the average interest rate for those with good credit? 

**Debt breakdown in $USD:**
* Credit card debt (27% APR) 
  * Amount:
    * $15.1k
  * Payments (Monthly):
    * ~$330 varies (minimum payment)
* Student loan 1
  * Amount:

investing,"WSJ: The Worst of the Global Selloff Isn’t Here Yet, Banks and Investors Warn","https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-worst-of-the-global-selloff-isnt-here-yet-banks-and-investors-warn-11584877018?mod=mhp


The most brutal stretch for global markets since the financial crisis likely isn’t over yet, say investors and analysts who believe it is too early to assess the possible scale of economic damage from the coronavirus.

In just a few weeks, U.S. stocks have lost roughly a third of their value. In recent weeks, investors have even fled assets like U.S. government bonds and gold that typically do well during times of turmoil, underscoring the extent of the panic and the shock to once-robust investor sentiment delivered by the global health emergency.


But many analysts and portfolio managers warn that neither those declines nor recent extraordinary actions by the Federal Reserve are likely to signal the end of the market crunch. They note that by historical standards, stocks’ declines look modest compared with some prior downturns, given the early indications of how much damage virus-related shutdowns are likely to do to global growth. The S&amp;P 500 is down 32% from its February peak. In comparison, stocks tumbled 57% during the financial crisis and 49% after the dot-com bubble burst in 2000 before beginning to rebound.


What’s more, some investors say, Wall Street is only now coming to grips with the dislocation being wrought by the virus. Analysts at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said this past week they expect U.S. economic output to tumble 24% in the second quarter, one of the worst readings on record and potentially foretelling a U.S. recession even if growth picks back up in the second half of the year.

With everyday life grinding to a halt from New York to Milan, the world’s biggest money managers and banks say they believe one of the most prominent market casualties from this episode could be long-term investors’ ingrained inclination to step in to buy the dip. Before the coronavirus outbreak, investors’ faith in the strength of the U.S. economy had led them repeatedly to rush back into the market after pullbacks to scoop up discounted shares, a response that became so routine it came to be known by its own initials, BTD or, with more intensity, BTFD. Now, many believe it could be some time before that behavior returns.

“The ultimate impact of the virus on economies and markets is highly speculative at this time since there is so much we do not know about how the outbreak will actually evolve from here,’’ said Rick Lacaille, global chief investment officer of State Street Global Advisors. “We need clarity on many fronts.”


Investors will get more of a sense of how badly the economy has been hit in the coming days when data on the manufacturing and services sectors and jobless claims are released.

The latter data point has already spiked—leading Goldman to predict there could be an “unprecedented surge” in the number of Americans applying for unemployment benefits over the next week.


The firm forecasts the S&amp;P 500 could be in for a 41% fall from peak to trough. Bank of America Corp. believes the selloff might not ease until the S&amp;P 500 hits 1800—a 47% drop from its February record. And Credit Suisse Group AG , which notes stocks didn’t hit their trough during the SARS pandemic in 2003 until a week after the number of new infections peaked, estimates the S&amp;P 500 could be in for a 35% drop overall.

If economic output shrinks by double-digit percentages in the second quarter, it would be a devastating pullback even by historical standards: Adjusted for inflation and seasonality, GDP fell less than 5 percentage points from peak to trough during the 2007-09 recession, which was the longest downturn since World War II.

To put a floor on the current market rout, some of the world’s biggest investors say they need three things: better information on the scale of the coronavirus pandemic, powerful support from governments and more forceful intervention in markets.


A key issue is the uncertainty surrounding what it will take to halt the fast-moving health crisis, and the economic fallout of such measures, investors say. Governments are using a range of strategies, from stringent lockdowns in Italy, France and Spain to looser recommendations of social distancing in the U.K. and much of the U.S. As the measures vary, so does the level of economic disruption.

Investors need “clarity on the ultimate scale of the problem and evidence that the infection’s curves are bending globally,” said Jean Boivin, head of BlackRock Investment Institute. Credible news on development of a vaccine and treatments would also help restore confidence, he said.


Central banks in some of the world’s biggest economies have taken steps to cut interest rates to bolster economic growth and are acting together to boost the dollar’s availability. Investors are looking for governments to also coordinate actions.

“One thing we’ve learned in the crisis in 2008 is that policy is a lot more than the sum of its parts if it’s done as a global response,” said Mr. Boivin.


So far, governments don’t seem to have deployed enough fiscal stimulus—especially in Europe, said Didier Borowski, head of macroeconomic research at Amundi. The relief and stimulus measures should probably be equivalent to 2% to 3% of the eurozone’s economic output, he said.

But others believe fiscal stimulus won’t do much to arrest the market selloff.


Cornerstone Macro analyzed the stock market’s response to bursts of fiscal stimulus during the 2001 and 2008 downturns and found the S&amp;P 500 actually continued falling over a one-year period.

“Selloffs end when the problem that caused the selloff is under control,” said Michael Kantrowitz, chief investment strategist at the firm.

Another area of concern for investors: the fact that credit markets, encompassing both the safest sovereign bonds as well as more speculative corporate debt, have been in turmoil due to liquidity constraints, the pressure to unwind the riskiest trades and investors’ demand for cash.

Investors would like to see “more aggressive steps by policy makers to provide some stability in fixed-income markets,’’ said Evan Brown, head of multiasset strategy at UBS Asset Management. “This includes a Fed/Treasury partnership to provide lending against corporate bonds as collateral and the ECB aggressively stepping up purchases of Italian debt.”

The Fed said earlier this month that it would provide $1.5 trillion through short-term lending and spend $500 billion on Treasury securities to improve market functioning. On Wednesday, the Treasury Department approved a new lending facility from the Fed to act as a backstop for money-market mutual funds. While this move is welcomed, investors say that the market is still weighing its effectiveness.

“Market participants need to feel they are backstopped without question,’’ said State Street’s Mr. Lacaille. “Arguably this is what the Fed and Treasury Department have tried to signal and achieve, turning from messaging into action, but it seems there is a leap of faith needed by the market too.’’",finance

personalfinance,Debt balancing for score increase? Apparently I need installment loans to improve my score.,"My credit score is not great now thanks to a time of unemployment.  I'm working on getting it back and until I find a second income source my known plans are finding ways to minimize my current repayment to debt

I have $10k debt balanced on a few  0% interest cards for 12-18 months, and another $10k in debt on a 18.49% APR card.  

I called the card with the interest rate and asked them about lowering it, and their denial included having no installment loans. Earlier I tried Credit Karma's free option for personal loans, and their offer was a loan to cover my other debt at 17.5% APR.  If that would improve my credit and help me get out of debt faster, great. I work for a bank, granted I'm a bit weary of seeking a loan from my employer.

Using random companies for loans I've never heard of online is a bit concerning, so what resources are recommended for finding a reasonable personal loan, and how many places can I shop around at to get quotes while keeping my score stable?",finance

personalfinance,Wondering how to buy a new house that needs remodel,"So my wife and I have been looking at houses for a few months. Our budget is $350k and we want something around 2,000 sq foot. We found a great deal on a fixer upper and are wondering how we would finance the addition/remodel. The house is a small 910 sq foot home that is in rough shape. My father owns a construction company and was walking though it with us and says it looks like a great opportunity. We think we can get the house for $120k leaving us with something like up to $230k for the project (although my dad priced something similar out for another house and it was closer to $200k). The benefit of having a dad in construction is cheap or free labor and discounted material!

&amp;#x200B;

We currently own a home that we have roughly $130k in equity. We have about $60k in savings ($25k or so for down payment, $20k for emergency and $15k we could use on the home). Here are some of the options we have thought of:

1.) Home equity loan on current property should pay for most of the project. Only concern here is if the housing market collapses in the next 6-12 months we wouldn't get the money back when we move and sell.

2.) Move in with one of our parents and sell our house in the next month or so. Need to see if they would be open to this. 

3.) Personal loan - don't love the idea of the higher interest rates, but it isn't forever... 

What other options do we have? We both have 800+ credit scores and total household income of $250k. We have $20k in student loan debt, my car that we owe another year on at $500/month with insurance and my wifes car which is a lease $300/month with insurance. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - What are options for financing an addition/remodel? Don't have the cash to fund the entire project.",finance
investing,Buying Leveraged ETFs is the only Long Term Investment that Makes Sense Right Now,"With all investments considered, The safest long term investment that in 5-10 years will perform the best when the market recovers has to be Leveraged ETFS.  


Mapping out the daily returns from leveraged etfs such as TECL, TQQQ, UPRO and comparing them to other etfs such as SPHD SPY and QQQ, it is very easy to see that especially in a recession environment, the expected returns of 3x ETFS will outperform on a 5-7 year period by literally almost 3 times.  


I have constantly looked for objections to this type of investment and I think they are answered very easy   


Objection 1: If the market moves sideways, and doesn't go back up, you lose money. When S&amp;P 500 portfolio goes down 5% it takes more then 5% to regain your initial investment  


Response: If you expect the market to ever return to All time Highs, the 3x ETF will always be profitable  when it does, as long as you buy and hold. If the market drops 10% and  it takes 12% to get back to neutral, the 3x ETF will go down 20% but rebound 36% to come back to neutral  


Objection 2: The 3X ETF has Decay. They have to pay LIBOR as well as a higher management Expense ratio  


Response: Right now the interest rate is literally almost 0 and the higher expected return of the 3x ETF more than justifys the expense ratio. If the market is expected to do 8% and 3x ETF is expected to do 21% than minusing 2% for expenses still leaves you at an exptected return of 19%.   


Also a 3x leverage benifits more from a Compound annual growth rate. Your earnings compound on your earnings making your possible return even higher  


Objection 3: if the market goes down 33% you lose all your money  


Response: 3x ETFS are re balanced daily, the market would have to go down 33% in a day and because of exchange circut breakers, the market automatically stops at certain price levels making this impossible. This is why an Inverse 3x ETF never goes to 0, even though we know the market will grow forever over time. 

  
 Level 1 or 2 (7% &amp; 13%) circuit breakers halt trading on all exchanges for 15 minutes, unless they are triggered at or after 3:25 PM, in which case trading is allowed to continue. Level 3 (20%) circuit breakers halt trading for the remainder of the trading day (9:30 AM to 4:00 PM).   


I am looking at any criticisms or Objections anyone has to investing in a 3x Leverage ETF because I am curious what other risks I am not accounting for.  


TLDR I encourage everyone to download the historical daily returns of TECL and compare them to QQQ because a 3x Nasdaq ETF outperforms normal Nasdaq ETFs in the long run even with every risk considered",finance

Week ahead, another black Monday looms overhead as CV cases continue to grow; SPY pushes as low as 210 before bouncing off; that with continuation of FED pumps and a potential bounce off of an even lower support for oil, seems likely to lead us into a two or so week 'fake-recovery' (I use this term, because no we wont jump up, it'll be quite bumpy &amp; interesting journey back to the 260-275 range leading into early-mid April.) Without going to off the rails too early, it appears likely that we see further deflation from there over the course of the rest of the year until SPY nears \~180... Oil threats loom over head (Truthfully the foundation of our economies massive inflation coming out of 2016); and in the coming weeks following the lifts of quarantines unemployment numbers will begin to surface.

personalfinance,Buy a home or continue to rent?,"Hey Reddit! So, just looking to get some outside perspective on my current situation. I'll put specific details below, but the question is whether or not to continue renting or buy a home. 

Here are some stats: 

23 years old

Married with 1 child

$80,000 income in the banking and health fields (health field is administrative not clinical)

Would be signing for a mortgage or new apartment lease this August 2020.

Credit score of around 640-660

Debts:

$40,000 in student loans (in deferment)

$22,000 auto loan @ 8% (kill me) (Plan on selling the vehicle for \~14,000-16,000 which is private party value and using personal funds to cover the difference to get out of it since I am belly-up)

$8,000 miscellaneous (no required monthly payment, but should be paid off at some point)

More Money Details:

Take home pay is roughly $4,150/mo

Car Payment is $504/mo

Rent is currently $1,375/mo + electric \~140/mo (2 bed + 2 bath 900 sq ft)

Savings come time of home purchase or lease signing \~$9,000 (Down payment would wipe almost half of this)

&amp;#x200B;

In theory I would like to purchase a home for a very conservative price. I am thinking $120-$140K with a monthly payment of \~$800-$900 (that's with escrow and PMI already calculated). In my market that can get you at least 1,200 sq ft and at least an acre if not more in both categories. I'd be utilizing an FHA loan with a 3.5% down payment. I'd have an interest rate somewhere between 4-5%, but could refinance down the road for a conventional with lower rate and no PMI. 

I just feel as if with what I've been paying in rent the last year I'd be breaking even if not coming out ahead every month. When you factor in principal pay-down, appreciation (may not happen with COVID-19 now lol), and the fact that the mortgage is less than my current rent. Now yes, technically maintenance, lawn-care, upkeep, and all that stuff may end up bringing that $800-$900 right back to my $1,375/mo rent payment, I get that. 

Just thought I'd get some other opinions/viewpoints on the matter. Appreciate any insight!",finance

investing,Futures hit limit down,"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/22/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html

U.S. stock futures opened sharply lower on Sunday night as Wall Street waits on Washington to agree to an economic stimulus and rescue plan to combat the giant economic blow from the coronavirus outbreak.

Dow Jones Industrial Average futures fell more than 900 points, or 5%, to hit their “limit down” level. S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures were also down around 5%. Downside limits to futures contracts are implemented to ensure orderly market behavior. 

Futures could be highly volatile as headlines come out of a coronavirus task force news conference Sunday evening and as traders await news on a stimulus bill agreement (or lack of one).

Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Sunday that financing programs to stimulate the economy could be worth $4 trillion, noting these efforts will include coordination with the Federal Reserve to provide businesses with necessary liquidity.

“When this started, this was a bit unique to the airline industry since we had shut down most of airline travel,” Mnuchin said. “This liquidity facility is a broad-based liquidity facility working with the Fed.”

National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow also said Saturday an economic stimulus package will total more than $2 trillion, noting it will be equal to roughly 10% of U.S. economic output. Last week, President Donald Trump signed a $100 billion bill that expanded paid leave in the U.S.

However, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., signaled she is not on board with the Republican-version of the stimulus plan, saying: “From my standpoint, we’re apart.” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell moved a procedural vote related to the stimulus package to 6 p.m. from 3 p.m.

David Kostin, chief U.S. equity strategist at Goldman Sachs, said the difference between a fast or a prolonged recovery in the stock market will come down to three factors: How quickly the virus is contained, whether businesses will have ” access to enough capital and liquidity to last the 90 to 180 days,” and whether fiscal stimulus can stabilize growth forecasts.

“If short-term shutdowns lead to business defaults, closures, and permanent layoffs, the damage to corporate earnings growth could persist well after the virus is contained,” Kostin said in a note. 

Wall Street has been clamoring for fiscal economic relief as the number of coronavirus keep surging. The number of confirmed global cases surpassed 300,000 over the weekend as deaths now total over 13,000, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.

In the U.S., more than 30,000 cases have now been confirmed. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Sunday cases in the state soared to 15,168 over the weekend. That’s more than in France or South Korea. 

The outbreak has led the New York Stock Exchange to close its trading floor and temporarily move to all-electronic trading beginning Monday. NYSE expects trading to proceed as normal. 

“Things will get worse before they get better and the markets will continue to reflect that reality,” said Marc Chaikin, CEO of Chaikin Analytics, in a note. “This means that a bottoming process will take more time and probably inflict more damage to equities.”

Stocks suffered their biggest one-week decline since the financial crisis in 2008, with the S&amp;P 500 dropping more than 13%. Those losses put the broad market average more than 32% below its record set on Feb. 19.

Last week ended with all 11 S&amp;P 500 sectors closing more than 20% below their respective 52-week highs. The S&amp;P 500 was also on pace for its worst monthly performance since 1940.

Expectations for the U.S. economy have also quickly deteriorated. Economists at Goldman Sachs wrote Friday they expect a 24% contraction for the second quarter after a 6% drop in the first quarter.

“Suffice to say that the economy entered a unique, sudden-stop recession in March,” wrote Prajakta Bhide, strategist at MRB Partners. “If there is no concrete evidence of meaningful progress toward controlling the epidemic in the next eight weeks, there will be no basis for people and businesses to feel safe to begin to normalize economic activity.”

Investors have also been rattled by a sharp decline in crude prices. West Texas Intermediate futures fell 29.3% last week, their biggest weekly fall since January 1991. U.S. crude is also more than 66% below its most-recent 52-week high.",finance

personalfinance,Getting back an offset tax refund?,"I have a federal student loan that defaulted so I recently started a rehabilitation payment plan to get myself back on track.  It is going though a collections agency called Central Research.  I filed my taxes prior to setting up my payment plan and was supposed get a $1933 refund, and was told that the payment plan protected me from the refund being offset or garnished.  I just found out on Friday that the entire refund was taken away.  Much like everyone else now, I'm out of work for the foreseeable future due to COVID-19, and could REALLY use the refund.

Is there anyway to appeal this or get it back based on hardship?  I spoke with my private student loan and they put it into a 2 month hardship forbearance without interest. But now the government is talking about suspending federal payments and I'm so upset that they still took my refund during this time.  Central Research just lowered my payment to $5/mo since I have no income.

I don't know what else to do. I don't have a job I can do from home, my income was too high in 2018 to qualify for any of the checks the government wants to sent (I know there hasn't been a law passed yet, but it seems they want the cutoff at 75k or 99k), and I have no PTO from work.

MachineLearning,[D] Advice after falling backwards into a job I am massively under-qualified for!,"Hi all. In need of some advice and am hoping you might all be able to give me some perspective. A little bit of background about myself.

Over the past several years I have been working in business and data analytics for a Fortune 100. I started off small, doing basic data analysis (things like using R to munge data sets to be fed into models, converting legacy code to open source, creating plots to monitor key metrics for the business). Over time I moved more to the business side, running some critical processes for the firm and analyzing ways to improve upon them through tech transformation (ie: cloud migration, multiprocessing, open source migration, simplification, etc...)

In the last 12 months or so I ended up with an awesome opportunity. To work with a team of machine learning engineers to build new ML models for the firm. Most of the data scientists working on the project had very little context on the business problem they were trying to solve, and because I happened to be someone with more exposure to the business teams and have more of a data background, I was added to the team. Very quickly the job became a lot less about programming and a lot more about building decks for Sr. Executives to summarize the results of the DS team. Daily, I would sit with our ML engineers, help them understand the needs of the business, learn about data science from them, and then groom high level work to be done for the next two weeks.

Long story short though, since I was the face of the project my name became synonymous with data science and machine learning. Word came through the grapevine I suppose and I was courted through a recruiter by a mid sized consultancy looking to move into the DS and ML space. I was offered a position to work for them for a massive pay increase. I have always lived by the ""fake it til you make it mindset"" and hate turning down any exciting opportunity with potential upside even if there is a high probability of failure. So long story short, I am now the Vice President of DS and Machine Learning at X boutique firm. I have absolutely no ML based training, higher graduate degrees (my undergrad was a double in math and finance), or context outside of the last 12 months of experience I have. I am looking for any sort of advice, whether it is to read X books, take X classes, hire X types of people, or take a certain attitude. The only piece of advice I would be more hesitant to take would just be to outright quit. Any comments are appreciated!

TLDR: data analyst with no former training in statistics, object oriented code, data science, or machine learning, through a series of attachments to other projects, has fallen into a Vice President of DS and Machine Learning role. What do?",technology
personalfinance,“Doctor Loan” Mortgage,"Hi there /r/PersonalFinance,

My wife just matched to a residency program and we are looking at moving in the next two months or so. 

We have been renting and getting by well enough on my salary while she was in medical school, and we are looking into buying a house or condo for residency. 

Here’s the catch - We do not have a ton in the way of savings. 

We have a decent emergency fund(~5 months worth) and some cash squirreled away for moving costs, but we don’t want to cut in to that for a down payment. As such, we have been looking into physician loans. 

For the uninitiated, a physician loan is a mortgage that has a few unique features, because new doctors are a unique demographic. Unless they have family money (which is common, but not our scenario) they just spent 4 years after undergrad not making any money and taking out a ton of education loans. Starting residency, they stand to make $50-$60k, and then after 4 years of that they will have a very lucrative career (~$350k average annually for my wife’s specialty) meaning they’re not likely to default on the loan in the long term. 

To accommodate this, the loans have some unique features such as:
-	Up to 100% financing ($0 down)
-	No PMI required
-	Student loan debt is not fully factored into the loan as it typically would. 
-	the catch is interest rates can be a touch higher. 

I’m just looking for any advice on this situation - I’ve never bought a home before and it’s kind of a lot, especially with me needing to find new work at the same time (current employer doesn’t allow remote work except for the case of the current pandemic response).

All I know right now is that I want our mortgage + homeowners + tax monthly payment to be something we can reasonably afford. Our logic in buying is that after 4 years and change we will at least have some equity built up for another move when she’s ready to start her career. 

What are the big pitfalls / common things I should be watching for as we are selecting a lender? 
What questions should I be asking as we go through this? 
What’s the best way to understand my exact monthly payment based on the amount of money we borrow? 

Thanks,

Disclaimer, I have never been the smartest guy in any room, and am hoping for discussion. [This is the link that inspired my train of thought](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/which-industries-lostgain_n_525504):

# Which industries lost the most jobs during the great recession.

[Here are the historical jobs reports over time, recessions highlighted](https://imgur.com/a/zmqaz95)

**Why Jobs?** The consumer is the backbone of the American economy, and the American economy is the backbone of the global financial system. The Fed/US Govt can aid, but they can't manufacture immediate recovery. So how do I create sustainable profits while my 401k gets curb stomped?

**Is this relevant?** I don't know, I'm just a dumdum who'd like to survive a downturn.  I recognize losing jobs =/= poor stock performance.  I'm just looking for who might be hit the hardest, because when a company is forced to do layoffs, they're not doing so hot.

**I want to hear your rankings** of who gets hit hardest in this downturn, out of these few select industries:   Retail Trade | Manufacturing | Durable Goods | Financial | Construction | Business Services

Here are my rankings and ill-informed opinions

1. **Construction**: tons of contract jobs/temp labor, if consumers are reduced to bare necessities a few things could amplify the contraction of construction revenue: massive supply chain disruption, no more residential improvements, commercial working from home, new construction and existing home sales drying up because home buyers can't drop $5k to $60k in a recession.  *I am purely speculating on the residential elements of this napkin ""analysis""*
2. **Professional Business Services:**  Imagining a very big dip. But I'm torn because A) there are a lot of work-from-home jobs in this category, but B) temporary services made up about a third of employment in this sector, i.e. contract jobs not being renewed = growing unemployment
3. **Manufacturing**: don't have a strong opinion about how manufacturing will be affected -- maybe should be higher, re:  factories shutting down and other supply chain disruptions
4. **Retail trade**: despite having added relatively few jobs since 2008, and sitting at ATH, and wages not keeping pace with inflation, the biggest retailers are consumer staples, which do well in a recession.  To contrast, in 2008 we bought cheaper luxuries (fancy coffee, fancy lipstick, etc.)  which have higher margins, but we may be reduced to further bare necessities in 2020.
5. **Financial Activities**: no idea, you tell me
6. **Durable Goods**: Having added very few jobs since 2008, these products take a hit with everything else, but don't necessarily nosedive.  The consumer/home goods sectors of this industry may drive jobs down, but not like retail (sectors: packaging, electrical products, industrial specialties, specialty chemicals, home furnishings, and consumer electronics/appliances)

MachineLearning,[D] Does Machine Learning have a role in predicting COVID-19 infection before symptoms show up?,"It’s pretty clear that standard virus containment methods are based on isolating and treating people with symptoms. This is why they often use heat sensors at airports. However, it appears that a high percentage of COVID-19 sufferers are spreading the infection before symptoms show up.

Let’s say you have the following:

\- location/time data for a large percentage of a country’s cell phone users

\- a very large number of tests

1. Medical professionals conduct testing and isolation based on their experience and human intuition given known infected. This would include testing family members and known contacts.

2. Machine Learning uses time/location data of the known infected with the time/location of others to generate probabilities of infection of the currently untested. It may be more of an assigned value than actual probability until there are several iterations run. For instance, someone who has three possible contacts may just have a value three times higher than someone with one.

3. Tests not used in part 1 are used on the most probable infectees.

4. Positive results are fed back into part 1 and it is iterated. The model is improved with the additional information.

Data other than cellphone time/location information may be useful. You are not aiming for exact information, so even a rough location would be helpful. Just enough to help put some people at higher priority than others for testing. Not to mention that the model can be improved with each iteration of testing.

I do acknowledge that this requires a very large number of tests to be available. But I don’t see another way to “catch up” to the virus.

I just wanted to get it off my chest. I can go back to my Netflix queue. I’m perfectly ok with this being torn apart.",technology
personalfinance,Trying to remove $80 extra withholding on W-4,"So for context, the company i work for has an app called “PayCom” it allows me to make changes to my W-4. I felt like taxes were taking too much out of my check so i wanted to remove the $80 withholding (i did this because they didn’t take any federal out prior to me putting the withholding in.) but anyways, i got a pop up saying this:

“You may have to pay a penalty of $500 if both of the following apply:
You make statements or claim withholding allowances on your Form W-4 that reduce the amount of tax withheld.
You have no reasonable basis for those statements or allowances at the time you prepare your Form W-4.
There is also a criminal penalty for willfully supplying false or fraudulent information on your Form W-4 or for willfully failing to supply information that would increase the amount withheld. The penalty upon conviction can be either a fine of up to $1,000 or imprisonment for up to 1 year, or both.
These penalties will apply if you deliberately and knowingly falsify your Form W-4 in an attempt to reduce or eliminate the proper withholding of taxes. A simple error or an honest mistake won't result in one of these penalties. For example, a person who has tried to figure the number of withholding allowances correctly, but claims seven when the proper number is six, won't be charged a W-4 penalty.”


So i’m worried that i’ll get charged $500 for removing the extra withholding, i’m not the greatest with all of this either so i just wanna make sure i’m not missing anything else.",finance

This morning I get an email saying the APY is now .05% and I’m pretty upset now off about being misled. The fine print says it changed as of 3.17.20 which is fine, but the nowhere in the app or the application was that indicated. I assume this is due to the recent economic downturn but there has been enough time for them to have updated to the correct information.

stocks,The week ahead,"As we wake up this Monday morning, the markets are down a couple of points, which in this environment is considered good news.
Asian markets got hit more than usual, with the Chinese composites down 3 and 4%, South Korea down over 5%, while Japan is the single market in the World in the green today, up 2%.
European markets opened down around 5%, but in the first couple of hours of trading they have regained around 2% of their losses. At 7 30AM ET, when this article is being written, the German DAX is down 3% and the British FTSE is down 3.5%. All other European markets are down from 2 to 4%.
The US futures opened sharply lower last night at 6PM and after 3 minutes of trading hit their 5% limit low. With the European markets opening and starting to recover some of their losses, we sow the same movements in the US futures. At this time the Nasdaq futures are down 2%, while the S&amp;P and Dow futures are down around 2.6%.
There will be three major factors that will influence the market trajectory this week:

Coronavirus numbers. As the outbreak continues to grow, the new cases and total deaths are raising dramatically every day now. During the weekend, we got more than 60000 new cases and 3000 deaths (20% of the total death toll). These numbers will continue to increase, especially in the USA and their increase will certainly have a negative effect on the outlook and the markets. Also very important will be Spain and Italy’s numbers and their fight against the spread. These two countries are the most affected of the virus and their death rate is far bigger. At the same time it looks like China has put the spread under control, but there are multiple scientists talking about a second wave. If they are correct, that could be catastrophic first for humanity and secondly for the stock markets as well.

Economic data impact. This week we will get the first real economic data showing the first effects of the economic slowdown. Tomorrow German and European PMI data is expected to plunge under 40, while US PMI’s are expected slightly over 40. On Wednesday, price index data and durable goods numbers, while on Thursday there will be major news from the UK and their Monetary policy, German consumer confidence and the Initial jobless claims in the US expected to report 750 000 (281000 last week). None of this data will be good, and it could bring the markets down even more.

Government stimulus. On the positive side the US Government is expected to pass legislation for the biggest stimulus plan in history, reportedly worth over 2 trillion dollars. There are still disruptions in Washington, with the parties not reaching an agreement yesterday, they had a procedural vote that needed 60 yes votes, but split 47-47, with democrats not agreeing to the Republican bill. This is politics and it will get resolved. I don’t doubt for a second that Congress will not pass the stimulus package. The only issue concerning the stock market would be the previsions on how long the companies cannot buy back stocks and worst case scenario if the Government will ask for a stake in the company in order to give this financial aid. The second part is highly unlikely with a Republican controlled Senate.

All of this being said, there are countless companies that have been pummeled, down 70, 80, 90% of their highs and are a bargain at this price. If you don’t mind wild swings you could start entering the market. If you are more conservative I would wait until this crises settles down and markets stabilize.
After this weekend one thing is clear, this crises is not going to end in two weeks and the economic impact will be much higher than any previous expectations.
Good luck!",finance

&gt; * U.S. stock futures turned strongly positive Monday morning after the Federal Reserve pledged asset purchases with no limit to support markets. Dow futures hit their 5% “limit down” overnight, and were off 600-points at one stage Monday morning, as a massive coronavirus funding package failed a key Senate procedural vote Sunday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average tanked another 900 points or 4.5% on Friday, bringing the weekly decline to over 17% for the worst week since the 2008 financial crisis. Ahead of Monday’s session, the Dow was off more than 35% from last month’s record highs. The New York Stock Exchange’s trading floor will be close starting Monday. The NYSE will go to fully electronic trading. The 10-year Treasury yield, which popped back above 1% last week, was below that level early Monday.

*****

&gt; * Top-level White House and congressional negotiators burned the midnight oil over the now-nearly $2 trillion coronavirus rescue package. Democrats blocked the bill in Sunday’s vote, saying it did too much to bail out companies and not enough to help workers. Several GOP senators, including Rand Paul, who tested positive for the coronavirus, were not present to vote. Others, such as Mitt Romney, were in quarantine as a precaution. The Federal Reserve and Treasury are working on financing programs that could be worth $4 trillion. Goldman Sachs upgraded shares of Boeing, which is hoping for a bailout. Boeing stock has dropped 80% from recent highs on the dual crises of the outbreak and the grounding of its 737 Max.

*****

&gt; * The United States has the third most coronavirus cases in the world, with over 35,000 and 471 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University data. More than half the U.S. cases are in New York, where the death toll increased to 153. Washington state has the second-most cases, with nearly 2,000 confirmed and 95 deaths. New Jersey, California and Illinois round out the top five states. President Donald Trump on Sunday activated the National Guard in New York, Washington state and California in order to combat the spread of the coronavirus. New York plans to run a clinical trial, beginning Tuesday, of a treatment regimen of antimalarial hydroxychloroquine and antibiotic azithromycin, a drug cocktail that has shown promise in fighting the coronavirus.

*****

&gt; * Global coronavirus cases topped 343,000, with 14,789 deaths and over 98,800 recoveries. China, where the outbreak started in December, still has the most cases at over 81,400. China’s 3,274 deaths are second to Italy’s 5,476 deaths. Italy is second in total cases at over 59,100. The U.S., Spain and Germany round out the top five countries. German Chancellor Angela Merkel went into quarantine over the weekend after contact with a doctor who tested positive for the virus. The German government is set to unveil major stimulus measures. Pressure mounts to cancel the Tokyo summer Olympics, set to begin at the end of July. Canada said it won’t send teams to compete. Local media reports indicate that Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is considering a delay.

*****

&gt; * Cisco Systems is committing $225 million to assist in efforts aimed at combating the coronavirus while the rest of Silicon Valley also initiates an investment blitz. 3M said it will supply New York and Seattle with a half-million N95 respirator masks to address the ongoing shortage of health-care equipment. Merck said it will supply New York City with a half-million masks. Chinese billionaire and Alibaba founder Jack Ma sent to Africa 5.4 million face masks, over 1 million testing kits, 40,000 sets of protective clothing and 60,000 protective face shields. BlackRock is committing $50 million in outbreak relief.

Preventing serial bankruptcies at the cost of printing trillions of greenbacks might just do the trick. Inflation becomes a secondary issue to be dealt with after this first step is taken.

They’ve raised it over time, too. He also has a loan for his truck which is 6% interest and payments are $500 a month with PNC Bank. His truck broke down last year so he needed to get another one immediately. His credit score has dropped from his card, where 2 years ago it was in the 700s, now it is 642. He can only afford to pay off 400 or so dollars a month, sometimes more, but the high interest rate is trapping him in the debt. He said this last month that $280 is going towards interest alone. What can he do? 

I told him to look into getting a personal loan with a lower interest rate and paying it off with that loan, then paying back the more reasonable loan. He said with his credit score it would be hard to find a better interest rate and it would hurt his credit score to open a loan with a new bank, on top of shopping around and having multiple banks do a credit inquiry. 

I also suggested a credit balance transfer, but he said it would hurt his credit score and he wouldn’t get a much better deal. He’s not 100% sure about all this, just what he discovered on google. Anyone have any ideas what he can do? Is he wrong about this? 

I have a credit score of 823 and bank with USAA. I’m almost at the point where I want to take out a loan for him, but I know that wouldn’t be wise for me.",finance

Forex,Global Macro - Weekly Notes #12,"After reading Parallax last post, just decided to share some love too with some light macro commentary on hot topics these days.

**Weekly Review - Macro Notes**

**22/03/2020 – 29/03/2020**

*Summary* – We review the latest developments on the liquidity effects of COVID-19, and the impact on the US economy. 

**COVID-19** **and its effects on liquidity.**

This week we have witnessed how the COVID-19 outbreak has caused a panic-driven demand for cash, with the DXY rallying to the 103 level. Banks, dealers, corporate treasurers and other investors have begun to hoard liquidity, while a very large number of firms – not necessarily just industries stressed by the virus – have begun to draw on their bank lines as their access to funding markets gets difficult.

Let’s face it: The US economy looks headed for recession and the US equities are just getting slaughtered. 

Most of the time, rapid currency appreciation reflects the outperformance of one economy compared to its peers. Instead, recent Dollar gains likely reflect the greenback’s role as an international currency used as a funding source.

We believe one of the main reasons for this movement is Non-US investors bringing the notional value of hedges down, as most of them own US equities on an FX-hedged basis. 

Yet these moves have created severe disturbance in funding markets. Term repo rates have spiked to 100bp over OIS with commercial paper following close. As funds lose balances, their managers tend to go on defensive mode which generally involves shortening the investment horizons and allowing their maturing commercial paper to roll off while shifting into repo and Treasuries.

Now the FED did not stay quiet and fired its liquidity bazooka providing funding to banks and primary dealers through large Open Market Operations against Treasuries. We also got similar programs to the ones used during the GFC: the Primary Dealer Credit Facility, the Commercial Paper Funding Facility (CPFF) and the Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility (MMLF). We saw how FX swap lines were opened with major central banks, following Zoltan Pozsar recommendations. And we got a QE program, with $500bn in new purchases of US Treasuries, and $200bn in agency MBS.

If these measures will help to provide the liquidity needed by the market, only time will tell. Our guesses are that this rush for liquidity will be reversed at some point in the near future, with the dollar dropping in a similar way to the 2008-2010 period during the GFC.

**US recession** **incoming?**

Based on evidence of intensified disruptions due to social distancing measures, we cannot do anything else but revising down our outlook for the US economy.

Thousands of restaurants and bars have since closed their doors, retailers have temporarily shuttered stores, hotel chains have already announced layoffs and airline traffic is reducing as expected.

The most worrying early indicator of what might be unfolding in the following weeks are the estimates released last Friday which show a jump in initial unemployment insurance claims of 70K, to 281K for the week ending March 14, reflecting sharp increases. In our view, this suggests that this falloﬀ in sectors will likely be accompanied by broader fallout in income and spending, at historic size and speed rates. 

What really worry us is the level of financial obligations by households and businesses that must be met. Bigger economic problems may begin if the loss of income starts to translate into debt defaults.",finance

personalfinance,Question about FICA tax,"I recently got a new full time job (36\~ hrs a week) at a city-owned animal shelter. I was offered medical/dental insurance but I'm 22 and still on my dad's so I declined. I did get life insurance, but I'm also not sure it is required. When I got my first paycheck, I had a total of $89 taken out in taxes. At my previous, also city-owned full time job at a local zoo, I never had that much taken out and there was no FICA tax. I've never had a FICA tax taken out at any of my jobs (in Kansas or Virginia) except this one. Here is my 2-week period paycheck info:

Hours: 71.57

Rate: 8.5

Total: 608.35

Fed W/H: 30.07

FICA W/H: 46.54

State W/H: 12.60

Net pay: 519.14

Is it required to have that massive tax taken out? One of my coworkers said I didn't have to. And I know some people have it worse where 30%+ gets taken out of their paycheck but I'm an independent person trying to go to college so I need all I can get.

personalfinance,Should I buy or rent right now?,"Fiancé and I need a bigger place. We’ve been looking at buying or renting for a while and now that this craziness is happening we are stuck inside our place all day (fiancé has risk factors for a severe outcome of the virus) and our lease is up in May. 

We are currently paying $1350 in rent. We found a house to rent that’s $1790. We were thinking we were going to go that route but my family is insisting that we need to take advantage of the interest rates and buy a house. They sent us the listing for a house that we really like that we’d probably end up making monthly payments of $1450 on. 

Buying a house in all this uncertainty makes me nervous, I’m anxious and renting just seems like the easier option. What if one/both of us lose our jobs? If we’re renting we could just break our lease and move in with one of our parents that live close. But is my family right that it doesn’t make sense to leave this much money on the table if we’re planning on buying in the next few years we should just do it now?

I have no immediate reason to believe that my company has assured us they’re not currently looking at layoffs and fiancé is in IT sales. We both work for Fortune 500 companies.

Bitcoin,New trading BIT.TEAM opportunities,"New trading BIT.TEAM opportunities

Currently, many crypto trading platforms are facing difficulties since the global traditional markets’ fall has influenced even the crypto industry.

Even despite the global economic difficulties there are still effective ways to trade cryptocurrency with BIT.TEAM.
 
Alternative trading opportunities for crisis times.

According to media, all of the markets are collapsing by the COVID-19 pandemic which is constantly growing. Governments are trying to improve the situation, so they boost economies by lowering interest rates and making citizens support payments. But as it turns out that’s not enough to save the economy.
Economies are collapsing one after another, companies are bearing considerable losses, and a lot of once rich enterprises are now on the verge of bankruptcy.  
When it comes to crypto, Bitcoin has failed to meet the investors’ expectations as a storage asset which is able to preserve the value in times of crisis. Anyway, it isn’t so much the Bitcoin itself as it is our fault.
None of the cryptocurrencies including bitcoin are backed by gold or by oil but they are backed by our confidence and trust. If this decrease happens again, this means that we do not trust enough.

But in any case, crypto market will recover, and all of the digital assets will start to go up. The point is, it won’t happen right away. 
So what should traders do at the time of inflation and economic recession? 

 
P2P crypto transactions
 
Р2Р (peer to peer) transaction - is an exchange of crypto assets that occurs directly between users without intermediaries.
In terms of trading, the implementation of a peer-to-peer networks mean that buyers and sellers now can negotiate prices of coins and tokens. 
At the core of P2P technology lies the decentralized approach which implies direct interaction between people.
And besides, this approach describes a computer network architecture (joint use of P2P files) in which each node can act as a server for other users and may also be used for digital currency trading.
P2P exchanges enable market players to make transactions directly with one another without third party necessary for making deals.
Standard crypto exchanges are companies that serve as intermediaries between parties and get their profit from fees. On the contrary, the P2P exchanges let parties make transactions based on pre-programmed software not requiring third parties.
This alternative approach has a number of comparative advantages. In general, P2P transactions are a good example of the philosophy of decentralization.

P2P deals on exchanges
 
Let’s see how basic crypto transactions work. People who want to sell bitcoins indicate the amount and price. All these orders are moved into an order book. Then a buyer who wants to purchase crypto searches for a suitable offer in the order book, or if there are no such offers creates his/her own “purchase order” stating the terms of the deal.
The exchange matches orders according to price where possible, and processes transactions. 
Such operations may take up a lot of time - from about 10 minutes to several hours.
 Fiat money remittances are even more time-consuming (in some cases, they take up couple of days). In order to speed up the process, the exchange acts as a trusted intermediary: it confirms all the deals even if the actual transactions have not been finished yet.

P2P-exchanges offer a different approach.
 
Every time there are matching orders for buying/selling the exchange’s software connects buyer with seller so that they could make a direct deal without third parties.
 Nevertheless, intermediaries may be involved as arbitrators in the settlement of disputes but no third parties’ participation is needed in standard deals by default. It is the software that matches traders in a decentralized way.
 
Benefits and examples

P2P-exchanges offer a high tolerance of transaction censorship, they are cheap to use, private and safe. 
All benefits of decentralized exchanges arise from the absence of one major company that takes full responsibility. Such company would guarantee some advantages but it would also serve as a point of failure, and each of its errors would have a negative impact on the whole system. 
Today there are a great number of P2P platforms that enable users to receive maximum safety, convenience and freedom. These are the world-known crypto trading platforms such as BIT.TEAM. Describing itself as a P2P platform it gives an opportunity to operate such crypto assets as:
 
BTC
PZM
BIP
LTC
ETH
BCH
USDT
BTT
 
Another benefit of this platform is a wide choice of international digital coins and means of payment that simplifies the transaction processing.
The issue worth special attention is the systems of payment. Visa, Mastercard, PayPal, Payoneer and most of Russian, Ukrainian and other countries’ large banks  will easily make any transaction.
There is also a referral system BIT.TEAM which allows traders to get bonuses from their partners’ deals within the service.
 
Conclusion

personalfinance,Deciding Whether to Buy or Rent,"Me and my wife are currently deciding whether or not to buy a house this summer. 

Some background: We were originally planning on waiting a few years because she’s graduating nursing school in about 3 months. However, I took a look at our finances and we’re doing a lot better than I thought we were in terms of buying a house. Currently, I’m salaried making about 52,000 per year, and she’s going to be a nurse and based on the estimates for where we are planning on buying/renting, she’d be making anywhere from 50-70 depending on the hospital she gets an offer with, so our earning potential is good. 

Neither of us have any debt, no kids, and we both have cars we own outright. We’ve both been taking advantage of that and saving like freaking crazy since I graduated in 2016, and currently I’ve got about 55K saved, and she’s got about 21K, plus we’ve got a retirement account that’s doing good, and we plan to start a separate Roth IRA once the Covid clears out and make regular contributions to it in addition to the current 401K we have now. We’ve both got insurance, although her costs will probably go down once she starts working because currently she’s just on a catastrophic plan.

Currently we’re going back and forth between 2 houses (we have other options we are considering in apartments and smaller/more affordable just in case these end up being a poor financial move, these are just our 2 favorites). One is available for rent at $1700 and the other is for purchase. On a 15yr mortgage, with current interest rates from the banks I have accounts with, the monthly payments including property taxes and insurance would be $1807 if we put down $58000 against the list price of $248,500. I figure the cost for closing will be $5000-10000 if I account for the inspections and everything else, so we’d still have a good chunk left over in cash on hand, plus I’d still be receiving regular paychecks and she would start working (ideally) about 1 month after we close so we’d have two incomes to support our payments and our retirement savings.

For extra info, the rental is a 3b/2br, and the house to purchase is a 3bd/2br but the current owner built a large shed in the backyard with electrical connections, which I could convert into an office/movie room with a small amount of effort (I have a construction background so it wouldn’t be too expensive, especially if I waited a year to build our savings back up) so the house could retain all 3 bedrooms for living space. 

So my question is, taking all that into account, would the relative hit to my savings be worth it to buy while interest rates are so low, considering that the next available rental options that would accommodate our current amount of furniture/commute/etc is only about $100 difference per month, and assuming our bills would be similar for lawn/electric/water since both houses are similar in size.",finance

[https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-03-20/oil-price-war-is-u-s-s-chance-to-protect-free-markets](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-03-20/oil-price-war-is-u-s-s-chance-to-protect-free-markets)

&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;The U.S. Must Protect Free Markets in the Oil Price War  
&gt;  
&gt;Uncertain times are upon us. Our jobs and way of life are being  affected by the coronavirus pandemic and by the measures being taken to  halt its spread. While these measures are necessary, they are also  suppressing demand for goods and services, crippling key parts of our  economy. Many families will soon feel a great deal of economic pain, if  they aren’t already.   
&gt;  
&gt;One  silver lining is that gasoline prices have plummeted to near-record  lows. Low gas prices are usually great for jobs and the economy, but  they carry dangers under the current circumstances. It feels great to  fill up for less and less each day, but the companies that produce our  energy cannot sustain these prices.  
&gt;  
&gt;But make no mistake: These prices are not market-driven. For  the first time, supply and demand are simultaneously being warped by  forces completely outside of normal economic conditions. Fears of  coronavirus have decimated our short-term transportation demand; global  estimates range from a drop of 5 million to 10 million barrels a day.  Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia is using its spare capacity to challenge Russia  for market share and force compliance with production cuts. In doing so,  Saudi Arabia says it will place an additional 3 million barrels a day  of oil on the market, artificially cutting prices. It appears that the  global oil market could be oversupplied by 10 million to 15 million  barrels per day, or roughly 10% to 15%, making it the highest level of  oversupply since 1974 — during the Arab oil embargo.               
&gt;  
&gt;The last 10 years have brought the latest wave of oversupply,  as the world’s demand for energy from oil and gas continues to climb. A  surplus of oil as high as 1.5 billion barrels could be hitting the  market in the coming months. This would far exceed available storage,  which may drive oil prices to their lowest ever and force companies to  shut down production and cut off necessary cash flow to remain in  operation.  
&gt;  
&gt;The  shale revolution made the U.S. the world’s largest oil producer and net  exporter, producing in excess of 13 million barrels of oil per day. At  current forecasts, this level of production may drop to 5 million to 6  million barrels of oil per day over the next few years, threatening  American energy independence and returning the U.S. to the days when  wars in the Middle East wreaked havoc on our economy.  
&gt;  
&gt;Texas is the world’s third-largest oil producer. The oil  price war endangers the state’s economy and, with it, the national  economy. Tens of thousands of Texans are being laid off in West Texas in  the Permian Basin and the Eagle Ford shale of South Texas as companies  shut down their drilling rigs. The U.S. and Texas stand at a  disadvantage in one respect: Both the Saudi and Russian governments  control their oil production, while the U.S. operates a free and open  market.   
&gt;  
&gt;Free markets have made the U.S. the world’s strongest and  most prosperous nation. But we face serious threats. In the short run,  we are at risk that a key part of our economy — our energy sector — will  enter a dramatic downturn. In the long run, there are even higher risks  that energy supply will be disrupted when demand returns. If U.S. oil  production drops by 3 million to 4 million barrels per day as a result  of artificially low prices, then, in a year or two, when demand comes  back and the Saudis and Russians are playing nice, things may look very  different. We could see $100-per-barrel oil, and $4-per-gallon  gasoline, with a large chunk of that money going overseas. That will  cause substantial economic pain to everyone in America.  
&gt;  
&gt;The good  news is, we know demand will come back. Demand for oil and gas has grown  every single year for the last century. The challenge is weathering  this temporary storm.  
&gt;  
&gt;What can we do?  
&gt;  
&gt;First, for those of us in the oil and  gas industry, this is an opportunity to evolve. How can we find  opportunities to cut costs and improve productivity? When demand does  come back, how can we be ready to move fast to fill it? How can we use  data to reduce risk and predict system performance so that our overall  risk profile goes down? Slowdowns create the opportunity for us to  develop new tools and solutions to capitalize on future opportunities.  That is how we have always been successful.  
&gt;  
&gt;Second, this is an  opportunity for the U.S., especially Texas, to lead in a way we haven’t  in a generation. No one — not the Saudis, Russians, Americans or anyone  else — benefits from unstable energy supplies. Economies thrive when  energy is predictable and affordable. The world needs Saudi Arabia and  Russia to stop flooding the market. Now is the time for our leaders to  stave off an extended oil war. And, unbeknownst to most, we have  something specific to bring to the table.  
&gt;  
&gt;**The  Texas Railroad Commission, which regulates oil and gas production in  the state, has the authority to set pro-rationing schedules, thereby** [**limiting production for Texas producers**](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-19/texas-regulator-mulls-oil-output-cuts-for-first-time-in-decades)**.  That power has not been used since 1973. In theory, Texas could cut  production by 10%, and if Saudi Arabia is willing to cut production by  10% from its pre-pandemic levels and Russia is willing to do the same,  it would return the market to pre-crisis levels (and only somewhat  oversupplied). While Texas controls its destiny, it doesn’t control that  of others.** We would need our federal government, and our president, to  make a deal that stabilizes oil markets.  
&gt;  
&gt;With other governments manipulating oil markets, it’s fair to ask: Why shouldn’t our government step in to try to *reinstate* a  more market-based approach? In an ideal world, this wouldn’t send  prices up even to the prices seen three weeks ago. Instead, it would  stabilize oil prices in the mid-$30s  or so. It would still mean hard times for oil companies and low  gasoline prices for consumers, but it would stave off a total oil  industry meltdown.   
&gt;  
&gt;We don’t have the whole picture yet, but with a global  pandemic disrupting our lives, perhaps it is worth discussing whether  pro-rationing for Texas producers is appropriate, if it can return the  world back to the market.  
&gt;  
&gt;We are facing some of the most uncertain  times in decades, perhaps generations. We will face them together.  Perhaps it is time for the world leader in energy markets to once again  be the United States.",energy

She's still eligible to deduct the contribution from her state income tax, as they're residents of different states and she's under the cap as an individual. If she recharacterizes, she'd lose that deduction.

Second option: She's moving to his state this year, which has no income tax. She could keep the traditional IRA (and state deduction) and then roll it into a Roth in 2021. They'd owe federal tax on the gain, but the investment would need to grow by 23% for a 22% normal income tax on gains to exceed the 5% state tax deduction on principal. I don't see that happening this year.

Two questions for the group. First, if the change in value by 2021 is negative, would that be federally deductible from ordinary income in the same way a gain would be taxed? Second, am I missing anything?",finance

Forex,Thoughts on the Market #3 - Things Could Get Worse... But There Will Be Opportunities,"# This is #3 in this ongoing series of macro-economic thoughts and musings. Like I've said before, these writings are for our existing investors &amp; clients, not for the general public. If you post a question in this thread, I'll do my best to answer it for you. I will ignore all DMs.

Last week I wrote that my pessimism about the outlook for stocks and the economy persisted. The market complied, by closing out the worst week for stocks since 2008.

This week my message is slightly different. I am becoming increasingly negative about the economy, but my views on the stock market are starting to shift a bit in the short term.

Let me clarify. Then, I’ll explain what I recommend you do about it all. Let’s start with the big picture…

**Heading for a Depression**

Without an enormous fiscal spending package, our economy – and the global economy overall – is heading for a depression. We could see a sharper drop in economic output than we experienced during the Great Depression.

Am I being alarmist? No, I am simply being realistic. In fact, my prior comments sound downright conservative compared to the weekend comments of James Bullard, the president of the St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank.

Bullard, one of the most influential economists in the world, said that our economy is heading for a possible drop in gross domestic product (GDP) of 50% in the second quarter. He also said that he expects unemployment rates to soar to 30%.

For an economy that produced $21.4 trillion of goods and services in 2019, these numbers are mind-blowing.

When I first started writing to you, I spoke about an imminent Black Swan event that would present the greatest trading opportunities of my lifetime.

My forecast was largely intuitive. I couldn’t find an historical precedent for this sort of economic collapse in modern U.S. history, since this collapse is largely self-induced. 

At the same time, there were certain market patterns and policy moves by the G-7 central banks which gave me the confidence to go on record with this sort of bold prediction.

The response of the authorities to Covid-19 so far suggests that we could potentially be in for an even worse time than I had first feared.

Trading conditions have been a bit chaotic, but I have been able to identify quite a few profitable trades so far.

I expect even better trading set-ups to appear going forward, so hopefully we will be able to make much more money together.

Let’s put things in perspective…

**What We Learned From the Great Depression**

From the stock market’s peak in 1929 until its low point in 1932, we had nearly a 90% drop. Still, the unemployment rate never went above 25%. GDP dropped by about 30%.

I am not suggesting that we will have such a steep decline in stocks, but I do expect our unemployment rate to come close to that level or surpass it.

If the response of the authorities is inadequate, then we could be looking at a very, very bleak period in our country’s economic future.

For sure, the current drop in production will be steeper and sharper than the drop we suffered through during the Great Depression. Airlines, hotels, broad areas of retail, entertainment, restaurants, and many other sectors will effectively shut down.

This is a truly awful time for workers and investors in these industries.

The job lay-offs will be enormous. Consumption will collapse, further fueling additional economic weakness. The sharp sell-off in the stock market will weigh further on the economy as the negative wealth effect will further dampen consumer confidence.

In order to properly frame the current situation, we need to remember that unemployment in 1940, eight years into the New Deal, was still over 14%.

It was only the massive deficit spending during World War II which finally pushed the U.S. into a full economic recovery. (We spent over 20% of GDP per year on the war effort, and 35% of GDP at its peak.)

Huge industrial production capacity and technological innovation were two of the main by-products of this spending spree. These helped secure our country’s position as the economic superpower of the 20thcentury.

If we don’t take bold steps now with massive fiscal spending and somehow get ahead of this virtual economic collapse, we will experience a drawn-out economic depression.

**Too Little Too Late?**

The main problem of the Hoover years, and even the early Roosevelt years, was that too little was done quickly enough.

Likewise, today, the program Secretary of Treasury Steve Mnuchin presented – which includes $2,000 handouts for everyone – will be way too little.

We will need much, much more, and we will need this quickly.

Of course, we also need paid medical leave, extended unemployment benefits, tax deferrals, economic assistance for many industries, and deferrals on tax and debt payments. This, however, is only the bare minimum.

We also need bold spending programs. Why? Direct public spending is the most effective form of economic stimulus, as all the money gets spent and jobs get created.

Yes, the Fed will need to provide massive amounts of liquidity to keep the machine running. It is only gigantic fiscal spending, however, that will get our country out of this economic crisis.

The Fed could print 10 trillion new dollars and buy all sorts of debt, but it won’t bring about the job creation and economic recovery we will surely need. We need to have money that gets spent put directly into the economy.

In fact, as I am writing, the Fed has announced UNLIMITED funding is available. Think about that for a moment. UNLIMITED! Have they gone mad?

It is hard to put a positive spin on such a commitment. What is the value of a currency that can fund an infinite amount of debt?

I would argue that the value of that currency, over time, will surely depreciate – A LOT. For a while, the dollar can get stronger, but usually I associate greater value with scarcity, not infinite supply.

That is a discussion for a different time, however… though it is worth noting that the stock markets are down several percent on the day despite this commitment.

**The U.S. Economy May Be on Its Own**

Going back to the job creation and economic recovery we need…

In order to achieve this, our politicians must put their petty partisan spats behind them. They need to stop worrying about who is going to get credit for bailing out an economy in desperate need of life-support.

The magnitude of the problem that lies before us is much greater than anything they have seen before, but I don’t think they understand this.

Are our politicians bold enough to do the right thing? I am afraid that they won’t be nearly aggressive enough, but at least they recognize that the Coronavirus requires an extended period of social distancing… which in turn will wreak economic havoc on the American people.

Depending on the steps Congress takes, I could have dramatically different forecasts for the future.

Clearly, we need massive investments in hospitals and medical equipment. We also need to modernize our crumbling infrastructure, both physical as well as technological.

We can’t count on Europe for any help as their economy is in even worse shape, and it is going to be absolutely devastated. Japan is also weak. India could very easily get slammed by the virus worse than any other country. China is reeling.

I have seen forecasts of negative 41% growth for the Chinese economy for the first quarter. The second quarter will be better, but not good by any standard.

We must be ready to create our own domestic economic demand and go it alone if necessary.

That said, here is what I expect for the markets over the next few weeks and months…

**My Stock Market Outlook**

Here is my short-term scenario for the stock market: I am expecting one more sharp down move before we have a technical bounce.

I may even give a buy recommendation for a call spread in the S&amp;Ps to catch this technical rally. This recovery could retrace about 50% of the down move so it could be worth playing. Stay tuned.

Depending on how things develop with Congress, however, I will probably be looking for levels to go short the stock market again – after the technical recovery – and play for yet another powerful leg lower to new lows.

From current levels, I wouldn’t be surprised to see another 15% drop overall by the time this sell-off is done. If things play out badly, this could become a multi-year bear market, with a lot more downside.

Keep in mind that this is not 2008, however. 

**You don’t need to rush in and start buying shares for a long-term recovery. It is better to be more strategic right now, preserve your capital, and wait for compelling investment opportunities.**

As noted, we might be in the early stages of a protracted bear market that takes years to play out.

Even in bear markets there are periodic sharp rallies. However, the old paradigm of the Fed printing funny money and pumping it into a stock market that just gets more and more overvalued is over…

We Are Still in The Early Stages… But There Will Be Recovery Opportunities

The Fed can’t fix the problems we are facing. Sure, they need to keep monetary policy easy, but without unprecedented fiscal spending, our economy will crater.

I see enormous opportunities coming, but not yet. I can well imagine many industries recovering sharply over the coming months, but like I said, there is no rush to get back in.

That said, during the coming weeks and months, my market analysis will likely expand a bit to include trades outside of foreign exchange. I will probably start mentioning some of my favorite companies in different sectors in which I see big opportunities.

Sectors with excellent opportunities for recovery include hospital supply groups, travel and leisure companies, infrastructure and construction companies, and even companies that specialize in things like 5G technology. They all could do very well once our nation’s quarantine is over.

But please remember that we are still in the very early stages of this problem.

Yes, there will be an economic package passed by Congress. It will have big headline numbers as that is what politicians like to do.

Pay close attention to how much actual spending is embedded in the package… and how much is more funny-money printing by the Fed. Making loans available is very different from actually spending money. We need the spending!

Interest rates have never been this low before, so it is the perfect time for the government to borrow massive amounts of long-term money and fuel true economic growth.

And yes, our deficit will balloon initially, but it is our best hope for a solid recovery. The deficit will come down over time and the tax base will rise, along with the strengthening economy.

In terms of currencies, we are quite extended right now, and I am admittedly a little cautious.

I don’t like the technical condition of the market, and my caution is heightened by the political risks that I see looming over the coming days. Before long, however, I hope to find more winning trades for you.

Good luck.",finance

We just recently bought a house and she decided that she wanted to use that money towards some additional work we could get done. So, we filled out a form to take a disbursement for the balance and opted for state and federal taxes to get withheld, and transfer it into our joint checking. We are aware that there are additional penalties we will likely have to pay at tax time next year.

Unfortunately, I transferred it into my IRA account instead (schwab..accounts are all linked, had the wrong account numbers displayed). It was sitting in the Cash &amp; Cash Investments field as about $4200 which was the total minus the taxes we withheld. Oops.

I opened a support chat with schwab and they had me fill out a form to recharacterize it.

Turns out, they calculate that based on the entire account balance and not just on what was invested. I received the money minus ~$600 after they processed the form, the $600 is still sitting in Cash and Cash Investments.

After getting on the phone with them, they said I can fill out a form to get the remaining balance out, but that if the IRS audits me I could get into trouble because the entire account took a loss.

investing,QE measures might be a correct play by the Fed,"Printing more money causes inflation. Or so we are told, by conventional wisdom.

Amidst the blood in the Streets and the looming recession, the States has decided to unleash aggressive Quantitative Easing measures to curb recessionary pressure. Now, anyone with an introductory level of Economics knowledge will tell you to “sit tight and buckle up!” as we seemingly pedal our sinking boat towards the crest of a stagflation waterfall.

But the question is, should we be worried that the Fed has chosen to defy the principles of Economics? Or… Are we simply overlooking an important element in this “money growth == inflation’ equation?

To find out, let us briefly look at how the “money growth == inflation’ view had come about: MV = Py.

&gt;M: Supply of money;  
V: Velocity of money (or the average number of times each dollar bill is spent);  
P: Average price of goods and services; and  
y: Total quantity of all goods and services sold during the time period.

It is important to note here that the above is not the least bit controversial. No economist disagrees with the basic equation MV=Py.

Here’s the problem – people in general only remember this: increase in M leads to an increase in P, because we are told that V and y are constant. What we might not recall are the questionable and inconsistent **assumptions** we are making to get here.

For a starter, V and Y are NOT constants. As one would expect, V tends to decline in recessions when people do, in fact, want to hold more cash. Also, there are no reasons that increase in M cannot lead to the rise in y. After all, the increased spending by stakeholders with “excess balance” due to the increased money supply will cause businesses to increase their output to meet the new demand. This increase in y is, of course, ultimately the objective of QE.

But perhaps the real nail in the coffin is this: the situation that is key to the whole process of “money growth == inflation”, i.e., the excess of the money supply over money demand, is entirely unrealistic in the real world scenario.

This can’t happen in the real world because the actual mechanisms available (Fed purchases of government debt from the public, Fed loans to banks through the discount window, or Fed adjustment of reserve requirements) cannot *occur without the conscious and voluntary cooperation of a private sector agent.* You cannot force anyone to sell a Treasury Bill in exchange for new cash; you cannot force a private bank to accept a loan from the Fed; and private banks cannot force their customers to accept loans.

As the COVID-19 erodes the demand for goods and service in the market, most firms have to borrow money to bridge their cashflow gap. The demand for cash by these businesses have risen, and quite reasonably, the Fed are doing what they can now to accommodate. Loans are being extended and debts are being sold by the private sector to the central bank. This will raise the supply of money, but never exceeding the demand for money to cause the fabled inflation of 2020.

My point is, QE measures and the federal government deficit cannot, by themselves, cause inflation. While the “money growth == inflation” view makes perfect sense in an alternate universe where all those assumptions regarding the variables DO hold, it is safe to affirm that these assumptions will not hold for now. It would have been so simple and intuitively appealing for these variables to hold, but this brings us to the bittersweet truth.

I tried calling the IRS, but I think their offices are closed now due to the pandemic. I will contact them through their website later. On every site I look on, the advice is to contact the three major credit-reporting agencies, file a police report, and put a freeze on my account. My parent is against doing anything other than what the letter is telling me to do—which is to go on the IRS website. They said things will only become complicated in the future if I do anything “unnecessary.” They told me to only take further actions if I get another letter telling me to. There’s no convincing them otherwise. My question is, how much trouble will this create for me in the future? I don’t even know how my SSN got stole or what will happen in the future as a result. I know the bureaucracy is a mess so how long will it take for my problem to get sorted? My parents just tells me to not worry and contact the IRS. But, any insight on this that could help me understand my situation better is appreciated.",finance
financialindependence,Unpopular opinion(?): Most of us are now better off,"TLDR: some encouragement

EDIT: Wow I did not expect people to have this little ability to read between the lines. Obviously I meant better off financially, not holistically. This is a FIRE sub, not a COVID support forum. As it happens, I tested positive yesterday and am currently self-quarantined, won’t seek medical support unless my breathing problems become much more serious to give the elderly a chance at support. This does not mean that I no longer analyse the world around me and try to gauge the success of my long term strategies. The markets wait for no (wo)man. Grow tf up and start thinking clearly about your and your family’s financial future. Rant over.


For those who are already FIRE’d, I feel for you and hope your plans are still in tact. For those whose employment are less secure or gone, even more so. 
But the majority of this sub, I suspect, are still in the process of saving, and probably less than halfway to their RE number. For all of those, your journey just got easier. 

One of the reasons why the FIRE community grew so quickly was because we just had one of the longest bull market runs in history, enabling people to retire as much on their stock growth as their earnings. While COVID is obviously a massive unexpected event, equity valuations were very rich on a variety of metrics, as can be expected after such stellar performance and accommodative monetary policy and is in part why the drop was so precipitous.  (This fact was pointed out myself and many others in the FIRE community, often who work in finance or economics, but was silenced as this was ‘market timing’ - which in fact it was).

This is all now moot as the market has corrected and then some (not that that necessarily proves we were right). And while no one knows exactly how things will play out it is highly unlikely that the world economy lost 30-40% of its medium or even short term productive capacity, as asset prices are basically implying now and might well continue to for an extended period of time as the second- and third-round (credit-related) effects reverberate through the world markets. 
So while stocks might not rebound soon, take some heart - if you still have your job, and stay the course, you might very well have just gotten a significant boost in your long term journey!
So stick to your plans as far as possible, (IMO) invest MORE now if you can, be thankful for what you have, pay attention to yourself and those you love, and enjoy seeing what it feels like to live your life (kind of) outside the rat race for a few weeks, and feel lucky that this did not happen at the end of your capital accumulation phase.",finance
investing,COVID19 and the Chinese market,"There’s been a lot of speculations about the dollar index. As COVID19 force businesses to close and equities to plummet, liquidity is king [1]. This explains the recent increase in DXY. However, between the Fed’s unlimited QE and the near 0 base interest rate, I think it’s inevitable that we’ll see the US dollar lose its recently gained value. This will happen when the virus dies down and businesses start to recover. Cash won’t be scarce anymore and we’re left with the inflated dollar. This brings up the topic I would like to discuss.

Although we don’t know for sure how China’s economy is going to play out, they will be the first to recover from this pandemic [2]. Assuming an eventually drop in the dollar index. What do you see yourself holding? Gold? Chinese equities or bonds? Even Chinese RMY seems lucrative. My guess is that investments are going to flood the Chinese economy during this time gap, triggering a snowball effect.

personalfinance,Schwab Tax Withholding Election for Roth IRA?,"Hi,

I've opened a Roth IRA at Schwab. As part of setting up the account, I need to choose tax withholding options for it, for federal and state (CA) taxes:  


&gt;As required by law, Schwab will withhold \_\_\_\_% from your gross distribution for payment of federal income tax, unless you elect to increase the rate of withholding or elect not to have withholding apply.  
&gt;  
&gt;Distributions from your IRA (excluding distributions from Roth IRAs) are generally subject to federal (and possibly state) income tax. \[..\] You may be subject to tax penalties \[..\] if your withholding and payment of estimated tax, if any, are not adequate.

The defaults are 10% for federal and 1% for state.

&amp;#x200B;

Of course, with a Roth, withdrawing your contributions is not subject to taxation. So is this simply a matter of Schwab oversight, not setting the defaults to ""do not withhold"" for Roth accounts?

Or their form applies to the *earnings*? (I thought those get taxed with 1099-DIV's etc., w/o withholding.)",finance

investing,(OC) Are leveraged ETF's really that bad?,"**Question:** If I plan on saving $100 every week, am I better off holding cash, SPY, or SPXL?

**Answer:** It's complicated, but either SPY or SPXL if you expect a bull market. (see pic)

https://i.imgur.com/bmKz2Vt.png

**Backup:** SPY is an ETF that tracks the S&amp;P 500. SPXL is an ETF that also tracks the S&amp;P 500, except it does so at 3x leverage. SPXL also has a much higher commission that SPY, which means that in times where the S&amp;P 500 is flat SPY holders will be flat while SPXL holders will be losing value.

I made a table and ran through many scenarios to see which option is actually better. I used the weekly historical data from Yahoo finance. I wasn't precise, but I went to about as far back as the start of the SPXL ETF. I made my model in Excel. I'll post a link in the comments.

For simplicity, the model assumes no commissions from a brokerage. It also doesn't take into account interest rates or inflation.

I did this to try and show that leveraged ETF's are not a horrible option for long-term investing, but with the huge caveat that the last 11 years have been a bull market and my data only covers the last 11 years. The commissions from the SPXL ETF do chip away at some profit, but as long as the market is steadily going up it's not enough to bring you down. That's a big if though.

**Some things to notice:** Anything that ends around now will show that cash is better. This makes sense since the market is at a huge low right now. Also, notice the streak around 2012 where Cash and SPY out-perform SPXL.",finance

personalfinance,(US) How can I see my options for an auto loan?,"Hey, all,

The husband and I are looking to replace my (totaled) car this weekend or next weekend. For the car we have our eyes on, we're looking to finance $18k.

Now, I haven't gotten a car loan since I was a teenager and my dad helped me get my first through my bank (who I am still banking with 13 years later). My husband has never gotten a car loan, so this is pretty much new for both of us.

If I'm correct here, the Google Approved way to get a loan is to apply for a loan at a credit union, your bank, and an online lender, then choose the loan with the lowest interest rate, head over to the dealer, and ask them if they can beat that rate. If they can, go with the dealer's lender, if they can't go with the lowest rate.

So, if that's correct, that's fine. We already have 3 lenders we plan to apply with, and the dealer we're going to has pretty good reviews. 

What my husband and I are a little confused about is shopping for our options. I have not applied for anything yet because we want to wait until the day or two before we actually plan to go to the dealership, but on the sort of ""trial runs"" I've done with clicking around, these lenders are asking me how much I want to finance. From what I remember over a decade ago, the bank ran my dad's credit and said we were approved for up to [whatever amount], so we went and found a car that was under that amount in total cost. Does it still work like this?

$18k is a strong estimate of what we'd need to finance, but it's possible we'd need a little more if our trade in isn't valued as high as they estimated online. Plus financing fees. So, if I need about $18k, should I really ask for $20k?

There's also a second car at the dealership we're *slightly* considering. This car is a little more expensive at $23k out the door, but we could afford it. If we're considering this, do I actually need to ask for $25k?

And then, we're still deciding how long we'd like to finance. We drive our cars into the ground, so paying extra in interest doesn't personally bother us. We're going back and forth on financing length. 60 months puts us in a good position. We can still afford the rest of our bills no problem, with a little extra for fun money.

Or, we have also talked about going with a 72 month or even 84 month loan. Yes, interest rates will be higher, BUT the monthly payment will be lower. This would allow us to pay off the car in 2-3 years without sacrificing elsewhere in our budget. So we'd still be able to put money into savings, we'd still be able to go out on weekends, and we'd still be able to save up for the house we want to buy in a few years. On top of that, with small monthly payments, IF we do happen to have some sort of emergency, we can address it without obliterating our savings. 

So, is it possible to simultaneously shop for loans at different lengths and different amounts? How would I go about doing that?",finance

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.

The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

Ethereum 1.0

**NETHERMIND**

The Nethermind client is finally included and these is great news for the eth1 client ecosystem. On one hand it took a while, mainly for two reasons. .NET support for ARM \[7\] is quite recent and, on the other hand, getting a self contained binary for ARM is not an easy task (although Microsoft has a nice cross-compilation tool set). Besides, Nethermind has some native dependencies and it took some time to figure out how .NET handles this and how to put all config and system files together (by the way, thank you very much to the Nethermind team for their great support,).

Nethermind is a great option for running an ETH1 node. .NET performs quite well and synchronization time is fantastic.

Keep in mind that Nethermind doesn’t download receipts and bodies by default, this is why the sync time is so fast. You can change this behaviour by editing mainnet.cfg file (see below).

As always, you need to enable the service and disable the other ETH1 clients. For instance, if you are running Geth:

    sudo systemctl stop geth &amp;&amp; sudo systemctl disable geth  

sudo systemctl enable nethermind &amp;&amp; sudo systemctl start nethermind

You can tweak the client parameters here (currently only mainnet.cfg is supported)

/etc/nethermind/configs/mainnet.cfg

Systemd parameters:

/etc/ethereum/nethermind.conf

As always, output is redirected to syslog.

tail -f /var/log/syslog

ARM32 version has some problems, though. There are lots of crashes because of memory problems (as well as the other clients). This is certainly related to the ongoing “allocation memory bug” \[8\]. See “Raspberry Pi 4” section for further info. Feedback is appreciated.

**HYPERLEDGER BESU**

Besu is an enterprise-grade Java-based Ethereum client developed by Pegasys \[6\]. Thank you very much to Felipe Faraggi for reaching out and give us further information about it.

Besu is now included in Ethereum on ARM (64-bits only) and you can run it as a systemd service (please see Nethermind instructions above).

    sudo systemctl stop geth &amp;&amp; sudo systemctl disable geth sudo systemctl enable besu &amp;&amp; sudo systemctl start besu  

It runs fine on NanoPC-T4 but needs more testing (particularly on the memory side). Please, give it a try and report your feedback to us. We will post more info soon, including full sync data.

Ethereum 2.0

**PRYSM**

Prysmatic Labs put a lot of work on their Prysm ETH2 client and the changes / improvements are impressive \[9\]. Additionally, they took ARM support very seriously from the beginning and are now releasing official binaries for ARM64. Thank you very much to the team!

We are getting 4-6 blocks/second (compared to 0.1/0.2 of 0.3.1 version.) This is a huge improvement and allows a NanoPC-T4 to sync the beacon chain in less than a day (23 hours).

To start syncing the beacon chain just start the service by running (again, stop and disable other clients):

sudo systemctl start prysm-beacon

If you want to be a validator, please, follow their instructions \[10\]. You can run the validator binary to do so.

Hardware

**NANOPC-T4**

Rockchip boards run on a legacy 4.4 Linux kernel and that means that it’s missing lots of improvements from the mainline branch, particularly on the storage side. We tried 5.4 and 5.5 mainline versions but it still needs some work, we will keep an eye on it \[11\].

On the other hand, there is an issue with log rotate (this is not a bug). We noticed that, if you don’t change the root password, cron jobs don’t work and, among other things, logrotate doesn’t truncate syslog and the it gets full. So, in order to avoid this, you need to login twice to change both passwords. First, as ethereum user (default password: ethereum) and second as root user (default password: 1234).

**RASPBERRY PI 4**

We’ve been experiencing memory limitations on the Raspberry Pi 4 for quite a while now, mainly caused by the 32-bit OS \[8\]. While the Raspbian kernel is already using a 64bit kernel, the userland is still on 32bit so, in order to mitigate these problems as much as possible, we’ve ported the Armbian virtual RAM system to the Rpi4 \[12\] that leverages the ZRAM kernel module to improve memory performance and, additionally, raised the swap file to 6GB. All in all, eventual crashes may happen so take this into account.

At the same time, we are looking for alternatives to set up a full 64bit image. Firstly, to get rid of the memory problems and, secondly to allow the Raspberry Pi 4 to run Eth2 clients (currently Prysm and Lighthouse). We are looking into these 2 options:

Official Ubuntu Server image \[13\]: We tried the official Ubuntu Server 18.04.4 that includes the 5.4 mainline kernel. The good news here is that we haven't been able to reproduce the allocation memory problem. The bad news is that the disk performance is painfully slow so this doesn’t seem an option right now.

Unofficial Ubuntu Server image \[14\]: As described on a recent post \[15\], this images is a pure 64-bit OS but uses some Raspbian parts, including the 64-bit kernel and firmware. We will try the new image soon and post the results here.

worldpolitics,The Morning Report - 3/24/20 —J.J. Sefton,"Good morning, kids. Tuesday and I am here to warn you that there is a deadly disease that is afflicting this nation. [It's eating at the vitals, to paraphrase Lincoln](https://constitution.org/lincoln/lyceum.htm); a cancer that has metastasized for decades that is on the verge of destroying every man, woman and child unless the most radical and drastic measures are done, and soon.

No, I'm not talking about the Wok-in Pneumonia from a Fledermaus Raw Stew. I'm referring to the Democrat Party and its house organ propaganda wing, the American media. To whatever degree this COVID-19 Chinese coronavirus poses a mortal health risk to the entire nation or is merely a more than typically virulent strain of flu virus, the fact of the matter is our President is using his executive branch authority to mitigate the impact of the current ""pandemic,"" hampered by the massive incompetence and negligence of the previous administration during its mishandling of the 2009 Swine Flu epidemic, while responsible leaders in Congress (99.999% not Democrat) are attempting to stave off an economic catastrophe caused by the shutting down of virtually all commerce.

Whatever our divisions are, and for my money they are deep and most likely irreconcilable, you would think that the Democrat Party - in the face of the constant drumbeat by said party and it's media arm that this is an absolute incontestable existential threat to our way of life and life itself - would put everything aside and get together to alleviate the damage. You would think. But no, they didn't. At the last moment, Malig-Nancy Pelosi, who is now arguably the most horrid human being in this country and among the top five in the world, has spit up a giant ball of virus-laden catarrh in the face of the American people by holding the emergency aid package hostage; an aid package that she, her cohort in evil Cuck Schemer and GOP leadership had hammered out and agreed upon over the previous few days.

Like the not-so-cunning stunt of ripping up the President's SOTU speech, this was also a premeditated act. Rejecting the Senate bill that *she herself helped craft* because it supposedly has secret codicils to help Trump and his advisors' businesses profit from it - a provable lie - she then magically whipped out a 1,400 page monstrosity that contains every Leftist radical policy wet dream that soaks the American taxpayer and derails the MAGA agenda. The calculus is that the American people, desperate for relief will blame the President and the GOP for playing politics and prolonging their agony. So far, from everything I've seen, it has enraged and galvanized a usually wobbly GOP behind the President whose approval rating is rising even in the face of this challenge. No doubt, he is going to go on the warpath against the Democrats, and justifiably so.

Whether this Too Wong Flu really is a plague of catastrophic proportions or just hyped to make headlines and political hay, or some combination of both, I stand by my opening assertion. The Democrat Party and the media are at best behaving in a seditious manner during a time of national crisis or indeed ginning up a crisis in order to gain political advantage. Either way, it's monstrous and evil. Loathsome toad James Clyburn admits as much by boasting that the virus gives his party a ""tremendous opportunity to restructure things to fit our vision."" I thought that's what elections were supposed to do, but hey, what the hell do I know, right?

In any case, my response to Mr. Clyburn is a simple one: Go To Hell. And take your goddam party with you.

But the bloated tick does have a point. In the spirit of never letting a good crisis go to waste, the President has the opportunity to point out the horrendous deficiencies in bloated central government bureaucracies, the insanity of how they have all been corrupted to advance socialist/social justice transformation of American society, and the even more insane trade policies from corporatist sell-outs that shipped our manufacturing sector and millions of jobs overseas. Most alarmingly to a nation that is a mortal enemy and hell bent on global domination.

Here's my vision, Mr. Clyburn:

* Putting America on the moral and legal equivalent of a war footing and enacting legislation that suspends every DC agency's regulatory power in order to expedite the building of new factories here in the US.  

* Tax incentives for investment firms and companies to build said plants.  

* Mandating the hiring of American citizens only.  

* Suspension of union-only shops and onerous regulations.  

* Tax penalties for companies who ignore the previous two items.  

* Incentives for the establishment and expansion of trade/technical schools, as well as for students and older Americans to learn a trade.  

* Consigning ""diversity"" and all other ""social justice"" garbage that hampers business to the rubbish heap.  

* Opening up of all federal and state lands for energy exploration while killing green energy boondoggles.  
That's just for starters. Of course these are all temporary measures, much like the federal income tax was ""temporary"" until the end of World War One (wink-wink). I'd like to put at the top the dissolution of the Democrat Party but let's stick with some attainable goals for the present. I'm sure we all can think of all kinds of ideas that can go into this battle plan or manifesto for the future. We're going to need it. There are a few flies in the ointment, not least of which is going to be the almighty shrieking from the Left in opposition as well as the corporatist traitors and sell outs at the Chamber of Commerce who were instrumental in getting us into this mess in the first place.  
Even if the President eases up on the lockdown as he is indicating he may do in the next week or so, our economy has taken a massive hit. We are going to need bold measures not to further encumber and enslave us with more bureaucracy but ones that liberate us from it and get us back on the track of economic independence as individuals and as a nation. That is what MAGA is all about. In that spirit, we can overcome this crisis and turn catastrophe into a boom that will make the past three years seem like a drop in the ocean.  
The only thing that stands in the way of course is the Democrat Party and the Globalists. Having exhausted every means they could think of to get rid of Trump and us, they are now poised to commit national suicide. That cannot be allowed to stand.",finance

Things are going downhill fast in terms of the economy, obviously. Our initial thought was that, after this covid-19 business has died down, interest rates will be low and it will be a buyer's market. But then we worry about selling in 4-6 years. 

What are the possible pros and cons to buying this year? Should we just wait another year? Or will things not be any better in a year and it won't matter? 

I understand this is all speculation and we won't know what's going to happen, but any advice/thoughts on this are appreciated!

#[Today's Top Headlines for Tuesday, March 24th, 2020](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/24/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-march-24-2020.html)

*****

&gt; * U.S. stock futures hit their 5% “limit up” levels Tuesday as top Senate and White House officials neared a $2 trillion deal to rescue the economy from the coronavirus crisis. The exchange-traded fund that tracks the Dow, which has no curbs, was up just over 5%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 582 points or 3.1% on Monday after the Senate failed for a second time in less than 24 hours to advance the stimulus bill. Investors were more concerned about talks on Capitol Hill than encouraged by the Federal Reserve’s announcement Monday of an open-ended asset purchase program. As of Monday’s close, the lowest since November 2016, the Dow was down 37% from its record highs last month.

*****

&gt; * Senate Democrats expressed optimism about reaching a relief deal from the coronavirus crisis after negotiations with Trump administration officials stretched late into the night. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said talks were set to resume Tuesday morning. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi came out with House Democrats’ $2.5 trillion bill. Also on Monday, President Donald Trump suggested he wants to urge businesses to reopen, sooner rather than later. “I’m not looking at months,” the president said.

*****

&gt; * As Trump considers relaxing some coronavirus restrictions, the U.K. issued a stay-at-home order, starting Tuesday, allowing only essential trips. All nonessential public buildings and places are closed, ranging from libraries to churches, outdoor gyms and playgrounds. All social events including weddings and baptisms are also prohibited. In China, the two-month lockdown of most of Hubei province was lifted. However, Wuhan, the city in the province where the coronavirus originated in December, remains locked down until April 8.

*****

&gt; * Global coronavirus cases approached 384,000 with 16,594 deaths and nearly 102,000 recoveries, according to Johns Hopkins University data. China, at about 81,500 cases, has just 21% of the infections around the world as the spread in European nations and the United States continued to spike higher. Italy, the hardest-hit country outside China, saw cases rise to nearly 64,000. The death toll in Italy of 6,077 was nearly double that of China and the highest in the world. Cases in America increased to 46,450 with 593 deaths. Nearly half the U.S. cases and the highest U.S. death toll of 188 were in New York state.

*****

&gt; * Top U.S. airlines are working on plans for a possible voluntary shutdown of nearly all U.S. passenger flights, industry and federal officials told The Wall Street Journal. The government was also talking about ordering such a move, the Journal said. The carriers and the White House have made no final decisions.Demand for air travel has plummeted as many states have issued formal stay-at-home orders or just encouraged people not to leave their homes. Social-distancing has become the new way of life as the world grapples with containing the coronavirus pandemic.

personalfinance,Serious consideration of going back to school full time,"I thought my job was secure leading into this Coronavirus panic. Now sitting here and no work. I am finishing my Associates degree in May (just have this one last acct2 class I am currently doing) and have been accepted at CSU Global for my Bachelors in Human Resources. 
Here’s the question: initially I had planned to do school part time while working full time, but now that I am out of work, and my gut tells me my job may not be there for me in a few weeks when its over (gut says the biz cannot sustain no revenue for that long and not go under)... I am thinking of just throwing myself into school full time.
Yes, I can get financial aid, thankfully, but wondered if it will come close to supplying the same income for housing and life costs as the job I had. I know it wont be equal but wondered if it can come close? Not a loan..., actual state and federal grant program. I still have 400% of my total available.
Background: I worked as a Exec Assistant for $33/hr full time. Boyfriend is an electrician and is paid well. Our expenses are not out of control but given the income to this point, we have bills and want to be able to pay them.
Thoughts? Resources? Yes I did FAFSA and all that jazz but just wondered what I might not be considering and what ways I could make it work better.

personalfinance,Property Taxes Paid for Filing Federal Taxes,"Hi personalfinance,

I bought my first home in June 2019 with my fiance, and have a question regarding our property taxes for the 2019 year that I'm having trouble figuring out from the forms I have. I will try to explain as best I can:

&amp;#x200B;

* When closing on our house, we opened up an escrow account to cover both taxes and insurance. We had to pay an up front amount at the time of closing (I believe to cover the time of closing through the time of our first mortgage payment), and then have monthly amounts coming out the rest of the year.
* The previous property owner paid for taxes up until the day prior to our closing date to cover that period of time.
* When filing taxes, I am asked how much I paid in property taxes in 2019. My form 1098 does not show that any taxes were paid, however I have money in my escrow balance
* From everything I've read (and I'm no expert and having trouble even finding information), it seems that taxes are usually pre-paid, or paid ahead. This makes me think I should have paid *some* taxes in 2019 given we've had the house for over 6 months.
* I confirmed with my mortgage bank that they didn't pay any taxes until January of this year (2020).

&amp;#x200B;

With that information, my questions are:

* Was my mortgage bank supposed to pay taxes for us in the year 2019? If so, how do I go about fixing this to make sure I'm all set and don't owe anything?
* I'm assuming if officially not taxes were paid in 2019, I should put $0 on my tax filing, but will this bring up some auditing from the IRS? Or is this situation normal?

stocks,Rules of the Federal Reserve,"So with the Fed being allowed to buy securities to act as brakes on the market and unleashing unlimited QE, I have a question/concern. Due to the Fed's central role in this current economic situation, would they not have access to information way before it is officially public? For example, I'm sure they've been in contact with Boeing and other troubled companies over the past week. What is stopping the Fed from acting on that information before it's made public? Investment banks tend to have the Chinese wall policy between buy and sell sides, is there something similar within the Federal Reserve?

To me it seems that there are going to be long term consequences to this decision where the Fed is essentially buying stocks at dirt cheap prices while simultaneously having theoretically unlimited buying power. Does anyone think this will have long term impact on the integrity of the open market and whether or not this sets a questionable precedent?

personalfinance,"24 y/o pre-medical student in desperate need of financial advice (budgeting, debt repayment, savings, investing)","Good morning everyone, I hope you're all doing well and staying sane during such uncertain times. This is lengthy post but I tried to categorize the major points as best as possible. 

A little bit about me

I am very embarrassed admitting all of this but it's about time I address it.  I am a single (no dependents) first generation 24F with very little knowledge in anything regarding personal finances, it stresses me out so much to the point that I’ve avoided it at all costs. I am fortunate in that I have very supportive parents however, I was never really taught anything regarding debt repayment, saving, building credit, and investing. I have been trying to teach myself these past few years but I still feel a bit lost. My parents are by no means wealthy but they were able to pay for a substantial portion of my college tuition and have allowed me to live at home rent-free after graduating. I graduated college in 2018 with a BA in Psychology and since then I’ve been working about 35 hours per week as well as completing a few prerequisite courses I need in order to apply to medical school next year and hopefully begin in the summer of 2022. 

My current financial situation 

I only have a Chase College Checking Account with a debit card that I use for pretty much everything. I have no savings account and no credit card. 

Income: I began my first real job out of college in September 2019. I get paid a laughable $15/hour averaging at about $900 biweekly after taxes which gets directly deposited into my checking account. As of today, I have about $5,900 in my account and that’s all the money I have to my name. I have been out of work for 3 days now due to COVID-19  (from my understanding those days will be paid sick leave but that still to be determined) but it’s possible I will be called in to go back any day. 

Debts: As of today, my largest debt is $28,301 in undergraduate student loans, all of which are federal nelnet-serviced, half are subsidized and the other half are unsubsidized. $1325 of that loan is from interest from the past 6 years with the highest interest rate being 4.66%  I have been in a grace period since I graduated in 2018 because I am still considered a student since I am still taking classes. I have not paid anything towards my student loans. I also recently purchased a used car because my last one (which was completely paid off) had a transmission failure not covered by warranty. I was able to get a good deal on a car that I love but I am left with $10,500 to pay. My mother (who is an actual angel) is giving me a personal loan to cover the 10,500 without interest but I promised her I would begin paying her back on a monthly basis beginning in April once I figure out what my work schedule will look like. 

Expenses: I buy most of my own food, pay for my own gas, any car maintenance expenses, my copays at the doctor's office and contact lenses and any misc. purchases I make with my own money. I would like to learn how to budget my money. I don’t consider myself a frivolous spender but I do think I spend a bit too much money on food. I don’t really go out to eat but I try to eat organic foods which are typically expensive. I’m still under my mothers health insurance plan (and intend to be on it for the next 2 years). I do not pay my cell-phone bill or my car insurance. No rent, no utilities. My mom isn’t pressuring me to pay anything but I want to stop feeling like a mooch. 

Credit: As of today my credit score is 755, most of which is from the student loan. It been higher than 755 but several car dealerships I visited ran my credit 4 times. In the fall of last year, my mother used a credit card under my name to pay for my grandfather's funeral expenses but that has since been completely paid off and that account has been closed.  

Investments: I have about $400 I’m playing with in stocks with Ally Invest.  That money was a gift to me from a family member that has been urging me to take an interest in stock investment. Although I am interested in investing my money, my desire to learn about the stock market is minimal. I am open to hearing other ideas on making my money work for me. 

My plan: From what I’ve read, I think my first priority should be paying off the interest on my student loans and then chip away at the principal but I’m just not sure how much I should aim to pay off each month. I promised my mother I would pay her at least $200 monthly for the car and I want to begin paying for my cell-phone bill and then eventually my car insurance as well. ANY BUDGETING RESOURCES WOULD BE GREATLY APPRECIATED!! 

My second priority is to open a savings account with a high APY. I was considering Ally last year when the rate was in the 2.1% range but now it seems like no bank is going above 1.75%. I am still considering Ally (1.5%, 0 minimum balance) or  CIT (1.75% w/ a monthly deposit of $100 or more or maintain a minimum balance of $25,000) or Marcus by Goldman Sachs (1.75% 0 minimum balance). Any other recommendations? And how much of my income should I aim to put towards savings? 

My third priority is to start building credit that isn’t just tied to my student loans. I’ve been researching and I think I might want to opt for the Chase Freedom Unlimited cc and only use it for things I know I can pay for (Spotify, gas, groceries, ezpass) and use the auto-pay feature to ensure I’m never late on a payment. Then next year when I begin applying to medical schools and have all the testing/application fees and travel expenses that come with it, I will open up a Chase Sapphire Preferred to take advantage of travel perks. 

My final priority is to invest what little money I may have left over. Since I have no interest in stocks, what other recommendations do you guys have? Or any suggestions on how to become more interested in stock investment? Or should I use that money for an emergency fund? 

Again, I want to emphasize how embarrassed I am not only on how financially dependent on my parents. I am incredibly grateful for the fairly privileged life I’ve lived but I’m trying to make the necessary changes to become an independent adult. 

Thank you all for taking the time to read. I look forward to hearing all your responses and advice!

TLDR; post grad pre-med student to start medical school in 2022, no savings no cc only checking account with \~$6,000 to my name, $28,000 undergrad debt, only major monthly expenses are car payment and food, need advice on how to budget,  debt repayment (how much to pay off monthly), savings (which bank and how much to put towards it), building credit and investing.",finance

stocks,Gold mining stocks to boom as gold rises; physical gold in huge demand,"Gold spiked up early in the morning, up around $120. Still up around $60, at $1622 an oz. 

I’ve been looking through all of the online reputable bullion dealers, they’re all asking at least $1662 an oz. If you wanted to buy a 1 oz Canadian maple leaf coin it’s going to cost you $1800 per coin. The premiums are going up as physical demand rises. 

As people finally realize the federal reserve is going to permanently monetize debt, the dollar will tank. I think we’re going to see $2000 an oz gold in 2-3 months if not weeks.

The gold mining stocks will outperform the metal due to their forward looking nature. Both great to have, you always want some physical first though. 

Silver is also a great buy at $14.15, the coins are selling for around $22-23. I expect silver price to boom after gold breaks $1800.",finance

personalfinance,Question on paying down debts and requesting emergency forbearance from federal student loan,"Hey everyone,

This morning I had a thought to hopefully get us a little ahead during this time of uncertainty, and take advantage of the 0.0% interest and emergency forbearance on federal student loans. The idea revolves completely around the idea of paying down interest-bearing debt first. Here's a quick breakdown:

My federal student loan: $15,000 @ 3.91% (temporarily 0.0%); paying $230/mo  
Wife's federal student loan: $4,430 @ higher standard rate (temporarily 0.0%); paying $95/mo  
Wife's car: $15,300 @ 3.39%; paying $360/mo

I can't confirm my wife's interest rate on her student loan, but I know it's some amount higher than my own rate. My thought here is to request forbearance through MyFedLoan on my loan of $15,000, and then rolling my $230/mo into our car payment, effectively paying almost $600/mo for as long as this lasts. In doing so, we'd be paying it down at a rate that would satisfy the debt in just over 24 months. If forbearance lasts only 12 months, that's still an additional $2,760 we'd be putting toward the car, on top of the assumed $4,320 during that same span.

Here's the MyFedLoan response to COVID-19:  [https://myfedloan.org/borrowers/covid](https://myfedloan.org/borrowers/covid)   
My main question is whether they would capitalize unpaid interest (interest that would have been accrued during this period of 0.0%) once it's lifted? The only thing they say is that unpaid interest currently on the account will not be capitalized. I'm still planning on making my next payment at the beginning of April to bring my balance under $15,000, and clear any interest currently due.

Good idea? My concern is taking some kind of action like this in order to get ahead a little bit, and then it somehow come back to bite us when we're fine operating as normal.",finance

I want to refinance into a 15 year fixed. 

Two weeks ago, my Loan Officer said I could refinance into a 2.625%.

I was told to hold off because it could go lower. Days after, the Fed Reserve cut interest rates to near zero. I thought I was in for a treat because it could potentially lower the rate even more.

personalfinance,"I now own a house, but mortgage &amp; homeowner's insurance are still under my recently deceased mother's name. How do I get a homeowner's policy while keeping the mortgage under her name?","X-post from r/RealEstate, hope that's allowed and sorry in advance for long post.

So, my mother recently passed in November.  4.5 years ago she quit-claimed her house to me and so I am on the deed, and considered the owner, but I am not on the mortgage / loan.  There were no other assets, and so there is no estate. I will be keeping the house, and renting it out, which I've already done.  I would like to keep paying the mortgage, and just continue as things are right now.  The estate lawyer that was ""helping me"" (but really did not help me much and I've done everything on my own) strongly suggested that I do it this way, to prevent having to refinance. (This is not a sketchy lawyer btw, it's just in Rhode Island, where everything is a little sketchy).

The reason I would prefer not to refinance, aside from costs, is because I just bought my own house and I'm not sure how a refi would work with my current debt to income ratio.  I have had other people tell me, brokers and real estate agents, to do it this way too to save the headache of going through this process. I do realize I could refinance this as a rental property at a slightly higher interest rate with proof of current tenants, and my debt to income ratio wouldn't be an issue. I'm saving that as a last resort.

I'm now realizing that if anything ever happens and there is a claim on the homeowner's insurance, likely they will be able to not pay out because I am not on the policy. So essentially I'm paying a policy right now that covers nothing. Currently, the policy is rolled into the monthly mortgage payment.

So, I believe the solution to this, outside of notifying the bank and the refinancing, would be to somehow get a homeowner's policy in my own name on the house. I spoke to my own insurance agent on my (not my mom's) house, and pretty much gave him the rundown, and he said that likely the insurance company will notify the bank if I tell them the circumstances of why I'm opening a new policy under my own name.

What do people do in this situation?  Everyone keeps telling me that this is a thing that people do, but I cannot find anything at all on the internet on this particular type of situation. 

I guess what I'm asking is:

1. How can I have insurance on this house, without refinancing under my own name? 
2. If my only option to refinance, can they deny me based on income / debt ratio? Or would they just hose me on an interest rate?",finance
worldpolitics,Each time the US economy has melted down a Republican was in charge. Is Trump Hoover 2.0?,"Each time we've falling into a financial depression a Republican has been driving and a Democrat has had to fix it.  Great Depression Hoover, fixed by FDR.  Great Recession GW Bush, fixed by Obama.  Corona Depression Trump fixed by ?  Granted this is a very complex subject there is an apparent correlation.  You could argue some policies set in place by previous democrats were factors in these economic failures and that may be partly true.  You could argue that the massive droughts in the US were out of the control of Hoover, but it was just one piece of the puzzle.  I am fully prepared to get owned by some historians.

Great Depression:  Herbert Hoover (R).    Most dangerous of all to the economy was excessive [speculation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speculation) that had raised stock prices far beyond their value.[\[144\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Hoover#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKennedy_199935%E2%80%9336-146) Some regulators and bankers had warned Coolidge and Hoover that a failure to curb speculation would lead to ""one of the greatest financial catastrophes that this country has ever seen,"" but both presidents were reluctant to become involved with the workings of the [Federal Reserve System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_System), which regulated banks.  

Sounds familiar right? Under Trump the stock market has ballooned out of control and COVID-19 has sent it all crashing down.

Hoover had taken office hoping to raise agricultural tariffs in order to help farmers reeling from the farm crisis of the 1920s, but his attempt to raise agricultural tariffs became connected with a bill that broadly raised tariffs.[\[156\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Hoover#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFausold_198593%E2%80%9397-158) Hoover refused to become closely involved in the congressional debate over the tariff, and Congress produced a tariff bill that raised rates for many goods.[\[157\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Hoover#cite_note-FOOTNOTEWhyte_2017399%E2%80%93402,_414-159) Despite the widespread unpopularity of the bill, Hoover felt that he could not reject the main legislative accomplishment of the Republican-controlled [71st Congress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/71st_United_States_Congress). Over the objection of many economists, Hoover signed the [Smoot–Hawley Tariff Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoot%E2%80%93Hawley_Tariff_Act) into law in June 1930.[\[158\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Hoover#cite_note-FOOTNOTEWhyte_2017414%E2%80%93415-160) Canada, France, and other nations retaliated by raising tariffs, resulting in a contraction of international trade and a worsening of the economy.[\[159\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Hoover#cite_note-161) Progressive Republicans such as Senator [William E. Borah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_E._Borah) of Idaho were outraged when Hoover signed the tariff act, and Hoover's relations with that wing of the party never recovered.

Sounds familiar right? Trump has been putting massive tariffs on many countries which have retaliated back.  Ultimately this is going to make getting out the corona depression very hard.",finance

investing,Why Bailing out Companies is Necessary,"Hi all,

I’m sorry if this is simplistic, but it really helped for me to have it explained. So on Reddit and on other sources of news I have been noticing outrage towards the fed and government around monetary policy and corporate bailouts. I listened to yesterday’s addition of “The Journal,” a free podcast from the Wall Street Journal which helped me understand what exactly is going on and made me feel less upset. 

So in a nutshell, we have many businesses losing their revenue streams and laying off workers. If a business is not generating revenue, suddenly other businesses who provide services to this business such as landlords or utilities end up losing their revenue as well. Consumers who lost their jobs can’t spend on recurring payments like Netflix, cable, utilities, internet etc. So loss of revenue in a small number of industries has reverberating affects throughout the entire economy. 

Many businesses have a revolving line of credit, a predetermined amount of money that can be taken out from the bank as needed for unplanned expenses. The problem, is that all the companies seeing these reverberating effects are prematurely tapping this line of credit. Banks have a limited amount of money that can be loaned out therefore creating a cash-flow crunch. Since the demand for loans is  so high, banks are actually charging higher interest rates due to limited supply. That’s why the fed is stepping in to support corporate debt.

Based on this explanation, it makes perfect sense as to why the government and the fed is obligated to step in here. The repercussions of inaction are higher than of action.  It’s easy to point the finger at corporations for being irresponsible, but hey the government forced companies to close and the media spread panic like wildfire.",finance

worldpolitics,This is America.,"TL;DR at the bottom.

As I sit here, watching the world in chaos, I wonder if the rest of the world thinks as poorly of my country as I do. I wanted to give a message to anyone listening - we know, and we can't change it.

I have been mortified over the past weeks as the true colors of my country have shown themselves. We are living in a world controlled by the wealthy at the expense of the poor, and it will be the death of us. As one of the millions of the poorer, uninsured Americans, I don't think I can convey the despair that I feel as I watch the leader blatantly lie about the threat of COVID-19, lie about possible treatments, and lie about our economy. The political scandals range from lying about the threat of the virus (but secretly selling stocks before the market crashed) to pushing false knowledge about cures (which are killing people). The wealthy can be tested needlessly, and the severe cannot be tested at all. Our states voice concerns about PPE and testing shortages while the federal government outbids them for materials. It has become alarmingly obvious that, no, they don't care if people die from this. They don't care about our doctors, our police, our customer service representatives, or our homeless. Treatment for an uninsured individual in severe condition was billed at $35,000. That's the cost of survival.

Our president said that he would rather suffer the loss of life than the loss of business, all while pushing for for his own, and many other, large corporate bailouts. We watch his daily press meetings with terror as he is constantly contradicted by scientists and medical professionals. The distortion from the media is uncontrolled, with them always pushing one agenda or another, when all the American people need (and want) are facts about the situation. The severity here is projected to surpass Italy exponentially, and that was before the president called for the end of social distancing - for people to return to work. When the virus was evaluated early on by WHO, it said there was a chance that COVID-19 will infect 70% of the world if left unchecked. The United States of America will facilitate this, I promise you. The president refuses a national lockdown because of how it will effect the economy, damn the consequences.

I'm currently in quarantine because my mom, who is immunocompromised, has been showing symptoms and is progressively getting worse. When she was tested, they told her 'no more than 48 hours for a result - but do not call.' It has been a week now, and her SO, myself, and my SO are showing symptoms, and no result as to my mom's test. I'm sure many of you know how it feels to be laying in bed, feeling terrible, and knowing that even if you went to hospital, it would only risk possible infection (to or from) one of us, and would offer no answer or help. My mom didn't want to get tested, but her symptoms were so bad that her boss sent her to the ER mid-shift. Her SO won't go get tested, even though he worked in the same building as the first positive COVID-19 in our city (who worked for 10 days before the results came back). His reasoning? My mom has to miss work, and they can't live without some kind of income. They don't live extravagant lives, one car, cheap phone service, and they rent their house. And even though she's compromised, like so many other Americans, her gas station position is considered essential. For $9.50/hour, she is (was) on the front lines, having people cough in her face, and getting screamed at for a lack of inventory. If she has COVID-19, I'm terrified she will die, but we have politicians urging people to return to work, stating that they are willing to sacrifice a few (thousand) dead to keep the economy from crashing (more than it already has.)

I am one of the lucky ones. A relatively healthy 20-something, living in a tiny house with my SO in a rural part of the country. But I can't go back to work, and I can't get any assistance because I lost my job a few months ago due to an injury. My SO, who was let go because her absences violated the point-based attendance policy, qualifies for the bare-minimum, which will keep us afloat for now. We are both sick, uninsured, and our savings have run out. But many people are not as lucky as us; and we live in a society controlled by people who value money over human life. I like to think that most Americans will disagree with the leadership, but some of them follow so blindly that it's unbelievable. The country is so divided because of our bi-partisan political system that it absolutely has an Us v. Them feeling. Instead of help from our government, we get videos of how bored our quarantined celebrities are. Regular people are wondering how they will feed their children, as food and supplies are hoarded uncontrollably.

I am no expert, not on anything, but I am terrified. Half of Americans believe that our president has done a satisfactory job at handling this outbreak. Some believe it's a hoax by the opposing party. Every day, as the headlines scroll across my screen, I'm reminded of Plague Inc. mid-game, where you start to see the scope of destruction your virus is causing.

TL;DR This is only the beginning of a very dark time in America's history. People are dying, the blood is on the hands of our political leaders, and money is worth more than life, apparently.",finance

investing,US Dollar to be crushed DD,"""... To get around this problem, a recent [IMF staff study](https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2018/08/27/Monetary-Policy-with-Negative-Interest-Rates-Decoupling-Cash-from-Electronic-Money-46076) shows how central banks can set up a system that would make deeply negative interest rates a feasible option.

**How low can you go?**

In a cashless world, there would be no lower bound on interest rates. A central bank could reduce the policy rate from, say, 2 percent to minus 4 percent to counter a severe recession. The interest rate cut would transmit to bank deposits, loans, and bonds. Without cash, depositors would have to pay the negative interest rate to keep their money with the bank, making consumption and investment more attractive. This would jolt lending, boost demand, and stimulate the economy.

When cash is available, however, cutting rates significantly into negative territory becomes impossible. Cash has the same purchasing power as bank deposits, but at zero nominal interest. Moreover, it can be obtained in unlimited quantities in exchange for bank money. Therefore, instead of paying negative interest, one can simply hold cash at zero interest. Cash is a free option on zero interest, and acts as an interest rate floor.

...

**Breaking through zero**

One option to break through the zero lower bound would be to phase out cash. But that is not straightforward. Cash continues to play a significant role in payments in many countries. To get around this problem, in a recent [IMF staff study](https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2018/08/27/Monetary-Policy-with-Negative-Interest-Rates-Decoupling-Cash-from-Electronic-Money-46076) and previous [research](https://www.imf.org/~/media/Websites/IMF/imported-full-text-pdf/external/pubs/ft/wp/2015/_wp15224.ashx), we examine a [proposal](https://www.nber.org/papers/w15118.pdf) for central banks to make cash as costly as bank deposits with negative interest rates, thereby making deeply negative interest rates feasible while preserving the role of cash.

The proposal is for a central bank to divide the monetary base into two separate local currencies—cash and electronic money (e-money). E-money would be issued only electronically and would pay the policy rate of interest, and cash would have an exchange rate—the conversion rate—against e-money. This conversion rate is key to the proposal. When setting a negative interest rate on e-money, the central bank would let the conversion rate of cash in terms of e-money depreciate at the same rate as the negative interest rate on e-money. The value of cash would thereby fall in terms of e-money.""

The US is not testing nearly as fast as Korea (17 times less tests per capita when I checked this weekend), nor is it taking the lockdown serious. Unless a million tests appear by this weekend so the virus can be traced and narrowed down, Trump has to face the reality that he either locks down fully now or blows this crisis out of imaginable proportions in less than a month by opening.

So in my opinion, how does a bottom look like? 20-30% drop from the current level, with decreasing volatility starting in one or two weeks when the spread of the virus becomes more clear and the economic data hits us hard. Shy but ever more common gains and then more big rallies than drops (but not 10% if that's what you want).

We've only had one VIX spike, in 2008 there were 3. Also plenty of examples of fake rallies like today's and the first Friday of the month. The sp500 was grossly overpriced in February, so whatever it fell until the first days of March was barely an overdue correction. Now you have to input recession to get the true dimension of the collapse.

personalfinance,Young person (22) confused about finances/investments in the midst of the apocalypse - CAN,"Hi good people of personal finance!

I've been a lurker for a long time, and while I've been meaning to post to ask about smart investments, I never got around to it. However, in the midst of all this craziness, and the tanking of the stock market, I need some advice.
I have had a job since I was 15, and saving money pretty well over the past 5-ish years, but I had never opened any account other than a normal savings account with a low interest rate. 


Last June, I decided I should go to my bank and open 2 investment accounts with them - 1 low and 1 low-medium risk. The first of which is my RRSP (registered retirement savings plan) - I did this bearing in mind that in Canada you are able to withdraw money from your RRSP if and only if you plan to use this money for a down payment. The other account is just a TFSA (tax-free savings account).


At the time of opening these accounts, I put $5000 in my RRSP and $7000 in my TFSA and have been contributing $100 into each account every month. That means in the months since opening these accounts, I have contributed $900 to each. The RRSP was over $6000 (not sure the exact amount) prior to my March deposit, and my TFSA was just over $8100 (again, before March deposit).


I opened my banking app yesterday to find that my RRSP was at $5230 and my TFSA was at $7200. I just checked again while making this post to find my RRSP at $5179 and my TFSA at $7118.
I talked to my parents yesterday and they gave me conflicting advice. My mum told me I should try to appeal to the bank - I'm young, I've already lost a lot of money, let me out of these investments. My dad told me to leave it - stocks are gonna plummet and then rise again, and anyway we'll all be fucked together after this shitstorm blows over.


I know that this is a scary and confusing time for many, but as someone who has not witnessed a depreciation this quickly and doesn't have much experience in stocks/ investments.... what the fuck should I do?
At the very least I'm gonna speak to my bank about withdrawing contributions to the accounts moving forward. But I'm scared I'm about to lose all my money which previously had been sitting nicely in my savings account, bothering nobody and making a small amount of interest. All of a sudden I have lost $1500 of my own money not including any interest made (which was at least $300 in each account).


Thanks in advance for any advice, and stay well redditors!",finance

1. When news outlets report that the fed has pumped x trillion amount of money into the stock market via repo operations, what does that exactly mean? To my understanding, these transactions happen all of the time in the repo market, so how do these securities circulate through the stock market in order to alleviate the selling pressure we are currently seeing?

I applied for a personal loan. Sadly, I was denied and was recommended to take care of my accounts in collections. Well, without the available funds to do so, I am at a loss. 

My student loans are currently in a period of forbearance but are still a concern due to interest. 

The auto loan is a worrisome factor due to a high-interest rate, which I am hoping to get refinanced but due to my current credit score, is not an option.

investing,"Why did Buffett overpay for Delta, and are the airlines going bankrupt?","Link to original post here, which has some funny images too:  [http://theyieldblog.com/](http://theyieldblog.com/) 

Text only:

With airline stocks in precipitous decline and details of a bailout being hammered out this minute, I've spent the past two weeks trying to better understand the longer-term profitability (or lack thereof) of the airline industry. Warren Buffett, America's favorite ruthless grandfather, famously joked about the airline industry in 2008:  
*Here a durable competitive advantage has proven elusive ever since the days of the Wright Brothers. Indeed, if a farsighted capitalist had been present at Kitty Hawk, he would have done his successors a huge favor by shooting Orville down.*  
I like to describe airlines as a capacity-commodity industry: profitability of the industry rests primarily not on the growth of the underlying market (the demand for travel), but on limiting supply (in this case, the number of airplane seats in the air) to maintain pricing.  


We see this precarious dynamic across many capacity-commodity industries: companies carefully expand production capacity, wary of sparking build-out wars. Samsung, commenting most recently on their Q4 earnings call, would rationalize their expansion of NAND (the chip used in solid-state drives) capacity very carefully, trying not to scare competitors into believing there would be industry oversupply:  
*Regarding our investments going forward, the base that we are operating in is that the demand we're expecting, as we mentioned during the presentation, is around mid-10% growth for DRAM and mid to high-20% growth for NAND. Basically, our default is to meet the demand growth through process migration as well as using our inventory. Now to answer the hypothetical question that you posed about, for example, this year, demand going far over what's expected overall, then we will have the option, for example, to respond to market demand flexibly using Phase 2 of Pyeongtaek or Phase 2 of Xi'an, these new fabs, so that would be an option in that situation that you've proposed.*  
Notice what Samsung is actually saying here: ""We can meet some demand through process node migration (Moore's Law), and we did kind of overproduce last quarter, so we have these leftover NAND chips and we'll sell those too. Oh by the way, let's just address this hypothetical question you've asked, for which we've already spent $2.3bn USD, that if demand were higher, we would produce more. Hypothetically. Not saying we're doing it, even though the fab is already online, just that we're ready."" What's worse, SK Hynix (the other leading NAND manufacturer) says much of the same thing: ""We'll produce more...if there's more demand!"" The two companies try to maintain face in the market by signalling a somewhat cooperative environment, while simultaneously attempting to sneak away and grab a little bit of market share. Everyone is trying to cheat their way, just a little bit, to higher profitability. As Samsung and SK Hynix demonstrate, all capacity-commodity industries are really multi-billion dollar games of [""just the tip""](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Just%20the%20tip).  


Similar to the NAND industry, which consolidated from five major players to four after the implosion of Elpida, the merger of Continental Airlines with United Airlines in 2010, and the merger of US Airways with American, shrank airline the industry to three large players (United, American, and Delta), with four tiny players (JetBlue, Southwest, Spirit, and Virgin) resulting in route consolidation and highly-profitable small-airport destinations (i.e., a flight to Buffalo NY has a higher price-per-mile than a flight to Chicago).  


Buffett describes this industry consolidation and collusion in his typical bullshit-folksy way, after taking an 11% stake in Delta Airlines:  
*It’s true that the airlines had a bad 20th century. They’re like the Chicago Cubs. And they got that bad century out of the way, I hope.*  
I really hope to one day learn to communicate in the non-threatening way that Buffet does (Magic 8-Ball says: ""Outlook not so good.""): he manages to entirely elide the overwhelming tendency of oligopolies to engage in widespread price and capacity collusion.  


There are a bunch of subtle ways that airlines can collude to restrict capacity. One approach, as alluded to by Delta in what I can only describe as the greatest big-brain-energy play in the history of collusive behaviors is as follows:  
*We at Delta were the only airline back in 2012 that voluntarily capped our carbon footprint at 2012 levels.*  
This is an evil-genius-level play. Since emissions are primarily driven by fuel consumption and fuel efficiency, Delta is de-facto signalling capacity restriction by signalling carbon footprint restriction. These people are evil geniuses, for managing to combine eco-friendly virtue-signalling with industry collusion, all in one neat, tidy, totally legally defensible claim that probably can't be litigated against.  


Another (arguably) legally-defensible approach would be for all airlines to pledge 85% of their earnings to dividends: airlines that cut their dividend (in order to grow fleet size), would see their stock immediately punished (since their dividend was cut), and dividends of this magnitude would prevent fleets from growing, thereby enabling stable industry capacity and profitability. Dividends would have the added benefit of preventing poorly timed share repurchases: the fact that UAL and DAL have cut share repurchases exactly when their stocks are cheapest is all I need to say here.  


Unfortunately for shareholders, airline CEOs are generally paid in options (which don't pay a dividend), and therefore, airline CEOs have a tendency to favor share buybacks, which, if you recall from our article [""How to be a shitty investor""](http://theyieldblog.com/stonks), are only good in limited circumstances.  


The biggest driver of airline capacity however, is no longer fleet size, capital allocation decisions, or emissions, but airport landing and takeoff slots: the scheduled time a flight is allowed to arrive and depart at a specific hub. These slots are effectively ""timeshares"" in the literal sense, and are owned by a specific airline, while being sold/coordinated by airports.  


Most US airports are near-capacity, so for an airline to gain a foothold in a new hub, an existing airline must approve it. This obviously leads to incredibly profitable horse-trading shenanigans (the horses are airport slots): like collecting specific properties in Monopoly, airlines will trade slots until a duopoly of airlines control the slots at each airport. This game of Monopoly even has a name: ""hub premium"", the higher price that passengers tend to pay when an airline has consolidated a significant percentage of overall slots at a single airport.  


Hub premiums and slotting are the real reason Buffett loves airlines: in good times, they can no longer be their own worst enemy, and are limited in capacity expansion through limited airport slots, and can even gain extraordinary pricing power in hubs they control (some online whitepapers have shown that the hub premium can be as high as 10-20%, which is effectively the entire profitability of the industry).  


In 2000, the Wendel H. Ford Aviation Investment and Reform Act for the 21st Century (Air-21) attempted to curb this behavior and attempted to ensure that new entrants had ample access to airport facilities and slots, stating that ""major airports must be available on a reasonable basis to all air carriers wishing to serve those airports"".  


In order to encourage airports' cooperation in opening up airports to ""all air carriers wishing to serve those airports"", Congress made federal sources of funding contingent on compliance: blocking passenger facility fees (up to $4.50 per ticket) in government subsidies should an airport fail to comply. Note that these fees would go to the airport, not the airline, as obviously airlines would otherwise happily eat a $4.50 loss to reprice by an extra $100-$200.  


Unfortunately for consumers, this law only applies when an airport is responsible for ""over 0.25% of all enplanements"", which means that smaller US airports are incredibly profitable for incumbent carriers that have no requirement to give up their slots.  


Analysts ask about slots on conference calls, and you should notice from the following JetBlue earnings call how closed-lipped leadership is being here: no carrier wants to tip their hand on how negotiations are proceeding.  


Hunter Keay of Wolfe Research to JetBlue management:  
*...can you update us and where you are on obtaining slots?*

  
Stephen Priest, JetBlue CFO:  
*Again, I'll pick up the aircraft side of things. And then I'll get Joanna to give an update on the wider perspective with regard to slots. We remain confident in our plans to continue to grow relevance in both New York and Boston with the European expansion. Great amount of planning underway and again because of the close cooperation with Airbus we are confident with the delivery timeframes around the A321. So I'm going to Johanna to give a better perspective in terms of - our perspectives in terms of slots et cetera.*

  
Joanna Geraghty, JetBlue COO:  
*...We continue to work multiple paths around slots and a number of London area airports were confident that our London plans can work in any number of airports. And we'll update you when we have a bit more information to share.*

  
The New York Times has some interesting stories showing how incredibly hard it is to break into an airport for a marginal player:  
*Virgin, for instance, has found it difficult to expand in big airports controlled by its rivals. The carrier tried for three years to get into Chicago O’Hare International Airport, where United and American Airlines own most of the gates and would not part with them. Eventually, the airport bought a concourse once operated by Delta and opened it to new entrants, allowing Virgin to establish six flights a day between Chicago and San Francisco. “They weren’t interested in another competitor,” said David Cush, Virgin America’s president. But Virgin is still finding it hard to get landing slots at Newark Liberty International Airport, controlled by United. As part of its merger with Continental, United sold some landing and takeoff slots in a private sale to Southwest Airlines that left Virgin out of the loop. As a result, United is still the only airline to offer a direct route between Newark and San Francisco.*  
You'll also notice from that article that only marginal airlines like Virgin are willing to comment: slot control is so important to major players that their representatives generally avoid all comment.

Slots appear to be the most strategically important property of an airline: they inherently restrict airlines from competing each other to death. Buffett is right as usual: the first 100 years of airline growth were uncapped by airport slot constraints, which are now preventing airlines from becoming their own worst enemy. To the upside, I see an enormous opportunity for airlines to be far more shareholder-friendly by enacting aggressive capacity restraint through dividend signalling and carbon emission control. To the downside, airlines will continue to face more regulation: airlines touch a broad base of political constituents and their long-term profitability is fundamentally capped by consumer ire and regulatory oversight.

If you've ever wondered if antitrust regulation is truly helpful, consider this: Berkshire Hathaway has over $124bn in cash or T-bills, and without regulation Buffett could trivially acquire all five US airlines with no external financing, consolidating airport slotting across every airport and gaining monopolistic pricing (I can hear Warren's heavy breathing), and single-handedly float their working capital needs. With regulation, new entrants will be able to gain footholds and compete if pricing gets too far out of wack. Ultimately, the answer to the question of long-term US airline profitability rests almost exclusively on regulatory oversight: with peak travel demand in non-Corona times exceeding airport capacity, US airlines will be as profitable as they can get away with.  


**Are airline stocks worth owning, right now?**

The airline bailout memo paints the exact picture we would imagine:  
*Pessimistic: $26B (67%) net drop in liquidity for A4A passenger carriers alone in the first 6 months of 2020 to $12.8B. By end of 2020, they will have dropped $53B (135%) to a deficit of negative $14B. In this scenario, all seven of A4A passenger carriers run out of money completely sometime between June 30 and the end of the year. Making matters even more urgent, credit card companies would likely begin withholding cash from sales before the carriers actually run out of money, effectively causing carriers to run out of money earlier than June 30.*  
Credit card companies ""witholding payment"" to the major airlines is an absolutely blood-chilling statement. There really is no precedence for this situation: in 2009, Delta still served 188bn revenue passenger miles with 82% passenger load. At its peak in 2019, Delta will do 237bn revenue passenger miles. We have literally *never* seen a true decline in air travel in the US, not even from 9-11. However, we do have real data, from Chinese airlines, for this exact crisis!  


**China Southern Airlines March 18 Press Release:**  
*In February 2020, the Group actively responded to changes in market demand, timely adjusted its operation strategy, optimized its capacity allocation and reduced some flights. Passenger capacity (measured by available seat kilometres (“ASK”)) of the Group decreased by 73.07% as compared to the same period last year (a year-on-year (“YoY”) basis). Of which, passenger capacity for domestic, regional and international routes decreased by 74.31%, 91.05% and 69.34%, respectively as compared to the same period last year. Compared to the same period last year, passenger traffic (measured by revenue passenger kilometres (“RPK”)) decreased by 85.11%. Of which, passenger traffic for domestic, regional and international routes decreased by 85.95%, 95.92% and 82.69%, respectively as compared to the same period last year. The passenger load factor was 47.11%, representing a decrease of 38.11 percentage points as compared to the same period last year. Of which, the passenger load factor for domestic, regional and international routes decreased by 38.77 percentage points, 41.86 percentage points and 36.92 percentage points, respectively, as compared to the same period last year.*  
Holy shit. This is awful. An 85% decline of revenue passenger kilometers for passenger flights. There is almost no way the US airlines get out of this without massive shareholder dilution in addition to loan guarantees. I am likely not a buyer at $20/share for Delta, the largest and best-run of the airlines.  


While Delta is better-positioned than United, **their working capital ""backdraft"" is simply too high**: flight refunds will absolutely devastate their liquidity. Delta had $47bn of annual revenues in 2019, so consider the possibility of Delta seeing $5bn-$20bn of pending refund requests (my wild-ass guess) while having only $2bn of cash for refunds, and $40bn of opex ($11bn of which is salaries, and $2bn of which are landing fees), the fixed costs of Delta still massively outweigh existing liquidity: I estimate the working capital suck to be so high that Delta and others may need a second bailout should this disaster last 18 months.  


Airlines are sort of like very fragile insurance companies or banks: they float/""lend"" an enormous amount of money ($50bn of revenues / $44bn opex for Delta) while being worth very little (Delta is valued at $13bn on the day of this writing). Airlines have been walking a very wobbly tightrope over the past 5 years, and falling off has meant a $50bn federal bailout, which vastly exceeds the amount the industry used to repurchase shares over the last 4 years. Airline profits should be tucked away for leaner times, but instead are wasted on overvalued shares, making their share price rise almost illusory.  


Ironically, the US Federal bailout's plan to block stock buybacks for US airlines should actually be great for investors in the long-run: were someone to buy shares today and hold until results normalized, airlines will be able to return cash to shareholders at incredibly high yields (as a percentage of cost basis). Delta prints $7/share in earnings in a peak year but pays only $1.50 in dividends. Post-bailout, we can imagine Delta's share count doubling (and share prices halving) from massive equity dilution. Imagine a world where Delta is forced to distribute $3.50 a share in dividends on after you paid only $5-$10 a share.  
One can only dream.

White House officials said the measure will cost about $2 trillion.

Negotiators worked all day, with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and incoming White House chief of staff Mark Meadows shuttling between meetings with Republicans and then Democrats.

The package includes direct deposits for all Americans, $367 billion for loans to small businesses and an unprecedented program that will allocate $500 billion to the Treasury Department. Some of that money will be used to guarantee a Federal Reserve loan program for small and medium-size businesses. Larrry Kudlow, director of the White House’s National Economic Council, said the funds could be leveraged into $4 trillion of lending through the Fed.

Most adults would receive direct payments of $1,200, while children would see $500 checks. Hospitals would receive some $150 billion under the deal and small businesses would get $367 billion in aid.

personalfinance,My wife can’t get a hold of her tax transcript from the IRS and it might prevent us from closing on our house,"My wife and I bought a house in 2018 that was in need of repairs before we could move into it. I’m talking uninhabitable, so when we closed we had to get a construction loan rather than a typical homeowner loan. We have since remodeled the house and moved in late last summer as we finished the renovations. Now that the house is complete, we are going through the process of refinancing the loan as a homeowners loan with a much lower interest rate than the construction loan. But we hit a snag. 

Because of an error that my dad made when he helped us file our taxes for 2018 (he accidentally put the wrong social for my wife on her return), our lender cannot get a copy of my wife’s tax transcript from the IRS. She (our lender) said we would have to call the IRS to get them to fix the error and send her a copy of the transcript. She only told us this in early March, after we had already locked in our loan with the bank. 

My wife was able to get the IRS to send us verification of the error but they did not give her access to the transcript and instead sent a letter stating that she would need to verify her identity before the could process the return. We got this letter in the mail last week and my wife has been calling the number trying to get in touch with someone to verify her return but I guess they are overwhelmed or something right now because of COVID-19. We’re both working from home now and she called today and yesterday at least 5 times each but we still haven’t been able to get in touch with anyone.  

In the meantime, we were supposed to close on the new loan this week but our lender is staying she needs the transcript to proceed. Our lender has extended the lock on our interest rate til April 7th but told us after that it would “expire.” She then said “The tax transcripts are vital. Those need to be received prior to closing. I was suggest calling every and perhaps several times per day. Maybe speak to your CPA. They may be able to help.”

I don’t have a CPA to help with this, and we didn’t realize the tax return was in error until after we had proceeded with the loan. We have been calling the IRS but because of the insane pandemic emergency going on we are unable to get in touch. Does anyone have a suggestion for how we can navigate this? Do we just keep calling and hope we win the telephone lottery to talk to the IRS before April 7? Or should I hire a CPA to help us out? 


TLDR: My wife and I are trying to close on a loan but we need to verify her identity with the IRS in order to get a transcript of her return. The transcript is needed for closing the loan. But due to coronavirus we can’t get on the phone with the IRS. Is there a faster option than just calling non-stop?",finance
Bitcoin,Fed Considering $6 TRILLION Stimulus Package - Bitcoin Wins - Anthony Pompliano,,cryptocurrency
stocks,Lawmakers agree to $2 trillion stimulus early morning,"Senior lawmakers and members of the Trump administration early Wednesday came to an agreement on a massive stimulus measure to try to keep Americans whole as the economy shuts down due to the coronavirus.

“Ladies and gentlemen, we are done. We have a deal,” White House aide Eric Ueland announced at the Capitol just after midnight.

White House officials said the measure will cost about $2 trillion.

Negotiators worked all day, with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and incoming White House chief of staff Mark Meadows shuttling between meetings with Republicans and then Democrats.

The package includes direct deposits for all Americans, $367 billion for loans to small businesses and an unprecedented program that will allocate $500 billion to the Treasury Department. Some of that money will be used to guarantee a Federal Reserve loan program for small and medium-size businesses. Larrry Kudlow, director of the White House’s National Economic Council, said the funds could be leveraged into $4 trillion of lending through the Fed.

Most adults would receive direct payments of $1,200, while children would see $500 checks. Hospitals would receive some $150 billion under the deal and small businesses would get $367 billion in aid.

personalfinance,"BoA Denied Refinance due to ""Cannot Verify Address""","First time poster here. Also on mobile, so, sorry. 

Recently shopped around for an Auto Refinance and Bank of America initially approved me for a great rate. Cool. Go to call the loan specialist because they never reached out to me and after a bit, he goes, ""Yeah I can't find your address in our system and because of that I have to decline the application."" I was frustrated and he told me to check my Experian credit report that I get free yearly for any info on why they can't verify my address.

I've been at my new apartment since November 2019 so it's not like I just moved here. 

I get pretty bummed that my good credit score is going to tank and say screw it, let me take a look at my Experian report like he said.

Well it's there. My address is there. My current one.

I call back and told him this news hoping he'd see what's up. Nope, pretty much just kept going I can't find you oh well declined. I asked to speak to the manager and he said that the manager would call back in 24-48 hours. I'll hold my breath. 

My question to you guys is: what's going on? Why was I initially approved and then now they decline it saying they can't verify my address? Why does my address show up literally everywhere else but BoA, including Navy Federal who also approved me and verified my address? Why is it not possible to send them my lease agreement, my credit card bills, my insurance info, my job details that have my current address on there? How bad is my credit score going to tank?

I'm just hoping for some answers before I call them tomorrow to find out why this is happening. Thank you guys and gals.",finance

investing,Infinite QE vs Market Question,"Hey guys I'm a bit new to the investing world in general &amp; in terms of pandemic levels so I just needed some clarification on infinite QE.

If the feds are able to print an infinite amount of money and buy corporate debt, securities, bonds, etc then wouldn't that pretty much put a band aid on the companies and thus increase share price? I understand it causes inflation and in the long run this isn't sustainable, but in the short term Trump can just keep pumping money to keep things afloat &amp; manipulate the market to go up.

I can see him continuously do this until the end of his presidency or until the virus subsides where he'll be hailed in history as the man who fixed the economy, raise his ratings, get elected for 2nd term, and try to fix the damages in the next 4 years.

I'm doubting this perspective because I see nobody else talking about the impact of infinite QE so maybe I'm missing some crucial element?",finance

worldpolitics,Erdogan hides from his people the fact of the death of the military in Libya.,"Turkey is often cited as an example as a country that openly claims losses in war zones abroad. However, this does not apply to the Turkish presence in Libya.  


In Turkey, on March 3, the online publication OdaTV (OdaTV) published information that Sinad J. (27 years old), an employee of the National Intelligence Organization MIT (Milli İstihbarat Teşkilatı) who was killed in Libya, was buried in Manisa province. According to this material, the scout was buried without ceremony, without publicity, in the strictest secrecy and without even writing his name on the grave.  


At the same time, the publication obtained photographs of the intelligence officer himself, as well as a photograph of a black wreath with the inscription: “Head of the organization” (Teşkilat Başkanı), the characteristic “teşkilat” alludes to the Turkish National Intelligence Organization, whose head is Hakan Fidan.  


After this news, Turkish authorities detained employees of the OdaTV publication. Access to odatv.com was instantly denied, even though the text had already been removed from the site. Journalists were accused of revealing state secrets and national security secrets.  


Another important point worth paying attention to: before it became known about the funeral of the Turkish intelligence officer killed in Libya, Recep Tayyip Erdogan carefully concealed information about the victims in this country.  


The Turkish president tried so hard that at one of the public appearances he said only in passing that there were losses among Turkish troops in Libya. Erdogan used the phrase ""several dead"" and immediately moved on to another topic. Such a declaration of the dead caused a storm of indignation in society, and after a few days, the Turkish president was practically forced to comment on the expression ""several dead.""  


OdaTV Editor-in-Chief Barysh Pahlivan, in an interview with one of the Turkish media, stated before his arrest that the identity of the deceased intelligence officer in Libya had previously been revealed by the opposition member of the Good Party, Umit Ozdag, who publicly announced his name at a press conference in the Turkish parliament. In this regard, all detained persons reject the accusations against them, since the information became available to the public even before the release of material on OdaTV.  


Erdogan carefully conceals the data on those killed in Libya, however, such information can be found from foreign sources that refer, for example, to statements by the Libyan National Army (LNA), but not from the Turkish Ministry of Defense or the country's president.  


For example, on March 16, it became known that the LNA attacked Mitig Airport, where Turkish attack drones are based, saying that several Turkish armed forces were killed.  


In addition, almost a month ago, on February 18, the LNA reported the destruction of a Turkish ship with weapons and ammunition in the port of Tripoli, which was delivered bypassing the UN embargo. Then it was announced the death of three soldiers from Turkey.  
Both cases were not publicized in the Turkish media, except for information with categorical rebuttals from Ankara.  


Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan explains his presence in Libya, firstly, with the geopolitical interests associated with gas production in the Eastern Mediterranean.  


The Turkish leader claims that neighboring countries in this region do not want to reckon with Ankara, and are trying to produce gas. However, according to Erdogan, Turkey has every right to both production and control of supplies from the mining countries of the region.  


Secondly, this is due to the fact that the PNS invited Turkish troops to Libya for help. If in the early days Erdogan promised to send Turkish mercenaries to Tripoli (most likely it was a private military company SADAT), then later he stopped voicing this idea.  


All this raises questions, since it contradicts the armistice concluded in Berlin in January 2020, which was launched with the filing of the Russian Federation.  


Ankara cannot explain the logic of the presence of its military in Libya, and therefore does not want the country's citizens to hear about any kind of loss of life, since such a situation causes growing dissatisfaction in society and negatively affects Erdogan's rating.",cryptocurrency

economy,Can we save the economy via financial hibernation?,"Is it possible to place the economy in an induced coma / suspended animation / financial hibernation to save the economy from catastrophic collapse?

Australia has already budgeted almost $200 billion towards a covid 19 rescue package, and the USA is proposing figures of $2 trillion. These are astronomical figures, and we haven't yet fully confronted the problem. What will be the final cost for Australia? $500 billion? Is even $1 trillion a possibility?

Will these rescue packages save those small and medium sized businesses that are going broke? What will the economy look like in 3 months.  Will there be any jobs to return to?

Can we imagine working together to save us all?  
How flexible is western democracy in times of crisis like this? How resilient is the free market. How effective is our political system?

This will sound crazy! But what if, we locked down all financial activity for 3 months. During this period, no money is to change hands. No company or individual gets paid for anything. No company or individual pays for anything. Bank accounts are frozen. The stock market is closed. No small business needs to worry about paying the rent for an empty shop. No commercial property owner needs to worry about paying the mortgage. No money changes hands. All financial activity is frozen. The federal government is temporarily the only customer in Australia. Only the federal government will credit selected suppliers for all essential goods and services needed during the hibernation period.

3 months should be more than enough time to extinguish the threat with an effective social isolation program. During this time, everyone stays home except for strictly essential services (doctors, pharmacists, grocery stores, police, logistics etc.). Food and other essentials are provided as welfare by the federal government, and are delivered to homes and dropped off at the door. (Or possibly collected from shops in a staggered system of supply - letter of your surname determines day of the week for shopping, etc).

3 months later, when the virus has run it's course,  all financial activity is resumed. Shops reopen. Employees return to their old jobs. People start paying their mortgages again. Tenants start paying their rent. The financial position of all companies and individuals will be exactly as it was prior to hibernation. We lose 3 months productivity, but we don't lose our jobs and the economy.

What might this 3 month hibernation cost the country? Will it cost more than $200 billion, or $500 billion? I don't think so. The Australian economy at full capacity only generates $350 billion in a 3 month period. In hibernation, it may cost less than $200 billion, and in the end, everything returns to normal. No business needs to go bankrupt, no employee needs to lose their job.

This may sound like communism, and its certainly very draconian. But it seems to me one way of saving the country from economic disaster.

investing,Are we missing out on huge gains from Bond prices?,"Hey Guys, 

Just read that the FED has agreed to a $2trillion QE deal to pump liquidity into the markets. 

This reminded me of a paper I read a while ago about the effect of QE on Corporate bond prices. The paper suggested that QE raises (inflates) the price of Bonds. See excerpt below: 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;By implementing QE, the central bank steps in, inflates bond prices and improves liquidity by making it easier for investors to sell these risky illiquid assets as part of the bond buying programme, thereby reducing the risk premium and lowering bond yields. The drop in yields and the increase in liquidity could potentially reduce risks in the system by removing problematic assets from banks’ balance sheets and by contributing to deleveraging.

And thus I am wondering if, as retail investors we should've been buying bonds a week ago in the hopes that we can offload these on the market once this QE thing gets started.. 

Am I right to think that, or am I missing something as usual? 

Thanks

*****

&gt; * Dow futures saw wild swings Wednesday between strong gains and modest losses. Investors overnight had been encouraged by the White House and Senate reaching a deal on a $2 trillion coronavirus stimulus package. On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average logged its best session since 1933, soaring over 2,112 points or nearly 11.4% in anticipation of the relief bill. Despite Tuesday’s gains, the Dow remained about 30% below last month’s record highs.

*****

&gt; * Boeing shares jumped over 11% in the premarket after Reuters reported that plane-maker plans to restart production on its grounded 737 Max fleet by May. The Senate bill, the final details of which have not been released, has money set aside to “stabilize key national industries,” according to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.

*****

&gt; * McConnell, just after 1:30 a.m. ET, announced the stimulus bill agreement, and said senators will vote and pass it later Wednesday. The Kentucky Republican promised the bill would help struggling industries and rush financial assistance to Americans through direct checks to households, enhanced unemployment insurance, hundreds of billions of loans in emergency loans to small businesses, and more resources for hospitals and medical equipment. Anything passed by the GOP-controlled Senate must be reconciled with the Democratic-controlled House, which drafted its own plan.

*****

&gt; * Despite medical community warnings about the continuing threat of the coronavirus, President Donald Trump said Tuesday he wants to open the economy back up by Easter Sunday, which is less than three weeks away on April 12. Trump said he offered the holiday as a deadline because Easter is “very special” to him. The president added, “I’m not sure that’s going to be the day ... [but] that would be a beautiful thing.” He stressed that any the decision to reopen the economy will be “based on hard facts and data” and will be “grounded solely in the health, safety and well-being of our citizens.”

*****

&gt; * U.S. coronavirus cases have soared in recent days, as testing kits have become more available. According to Johns Hopkins University, America has more than 55,200 cases, the third most of any country in the world, with 802 deaths. Italy’s more than 69,100 cases are second only China’s over 81,600 cases. However, Italy’s death toll of 6,820 is more than double that of China, where the outbreak started in December. Global cases increased to about 428,400 with 19,119 deaths and over 109,400 recoveries. Spain, Germany and France are also emerging as hot-spots in Europe. In Britain, Prince Charles’ household announced that the heir to the throne has tested positive for COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus.

*****

&gt; * Target, one of the retailers that’s seen a surge in shoppers, said Wednesday it’s scaling back plans to remodel hundreds of stores, postponing openings of new stores and delaying the addition of fresh groceries and beer to curbside pickup. Target CEO Brian Cornell said the retailer will focus on a singular mission: providing food, medicine and other essential items during the pandemic. Target is also withdrawing its guidance for the first quarter and fiscal year because of the unpredictable business climate. People have been flocking to Target, Walmart, Costco and Amazon, stocking up in case of prolonged supply chain disruptions.

CryptoCurrency,Discussion on the Price of Gold in Light of Recent Fed Stimulus,,cryptocurrency
stocks,2 Trillion dollars coming to the economy,"Early this morning we got word from Congress that a deal was reached between the Trump Administration, Republicans and Democrats in the Senate on a 2 trillion dollar stimulus package to the economy. All details are still not available but from what we know:

1200 dollar checks for individuals making 75000$ or less a year, with 500$ for every child

Relive for Airlines, Aerospace, Hotels, Cruise lines and every other affected part of the Economy

Help for small business

Unemployment benefits from the Government for up to 4 months

450 billion dollars that can be leveraged with the Fed for an additional 4 billion dollars if needed.

There is much more in the bill, but there is no question it will be a giant injection for the economy. That being said the outbreak is still at large, spreading rapidly all over the World. Last night India put its 1.3 billion people in a strict lock down for 1 month. Cases are rising in all European countries, with Italy and Spain leading the way, but the UK got its biggest new cases numbers, with Prince Charles the hair to the throne testing positive.
As all the stock markets reacts to all of this news, Asia started very strong Chinese stocks up around 2 to 3%, South Korea was up 6% and Japan lead the way, with their NIKKEI up 8%.
European stocks started high, but lost most of their gains, all hovering around neutral, with the German DAX negative at this time (8 30 AM ET).
The US futures followed these movements, riding on the Asian positive wave, with thee futures up over 3% at one point in the night. After the news hit about the stimulus package being agreed upon, all major futures started going down very rapidly. At this time the S&amp;P and NASDAQ are down around 1%, while the Dow is slightly positive, up 0.5% on a surging Boeing, up another 15% in the pre-market.
I am very glad about Boeing ( 147$ in the pre-market) since I wrote last Tuesday that Boeing was a great company to buy since this Government help was more than likely (their stock price was 103$ when I wrote my article).

For today, I will be looking for an upward move at the open, since this drop in the futures was really strange, get in and out, making around 1-2%. I do not want to be in positions as more and more news comes in later in the day, especially if New York reports another uptick in cases, Italy has another jump, that could bring the market down later in the afternoon, but I will not short, since at the same time The Senate will be voting and that could run up the market again.
Good luck!",finance
personalfinance,My Situation: Roth or Trad?,"Hi Everyone,

I can't figure out which IRA format would be best for my situation. On one hand, I don't earn much so I'd think a traditional IRA would be best so that I can maximize  compound interest by investing my tax deductions back into the IRA. On the other hand, I could be in a higher tax bracket at retirement than I am now, in which case I would pay more taxes with a trad than a roth. How to know which is more: gains from from re-investing tax deductions into a trad, or gains from not losing on taxes at retirement? Are there formulas to compare?

Additional Info -

I'm 33 years old and just starting to get my finances in order. I only have about 2 grand to put in an IRA today. I currently earn 25 grand a year, but in 2 years when I graduate I will be in the 50-100 grand a year zone. I will graduate with 55 grand of school debt. This is a STEM grad degree btw, and debt is from undergrad (fed loans, half is subsidized, both are in deferment and I'm paying interest plus a little more). I'm expecting to retire around age 65.

Federal: Married Filing Jointly and 2c (the two jobs total box)

State: Married but filing at higher single rate.

After doing so my state taxes increased, which makes sense but my federal taxes decreased (by about $55)...I'm super confused by this and my employer's payroll dept said they can't help me other than that they received my W4s. Am I missing something here, or is it possible that selecting Option 2c on Federal W4 isn't taking off enough taxes? My partner also chose option 2c and we make basically the same thing (2k different in salaries).

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: Included images of my employer provided ADP W4 portal - Federal shows me as married filing jointly (but don't see option 2c mentioned anywhere, even though I sent in my W4 and chose that option). State shows me as single - is that because I chose married but filing at higher single rate?

personalfinance,Refinancing an auto loan — good idea?,"I took out a roughly $23K auto loan about 1 1/2 years ago through my credit union with an 85-month term (money was a bit tighter then) and an interest rate of 4.7%.

I’ve been making the minimum payment of $320 each month since. The current balance on the loan is just under $18K.

The vehicle is a Subaru Crosstrek and is in great shape with less than 22K miles. 

My credit score usually hovers in the low 800s.

With these numbers, would it make sense for me to try and refinance the loan for a lower interest rate and therefore lower monthly payments? Would I refinance through my CU or through another entity?

Any advice is much appreciated!",finance

economy,Can the Federal Reserve directly distribute funds to individuals?,"Given the ongoing shutdown of the economy it's difficult to ensure SMBs, individuals, and capital intensive industries will have the capital to continue servicing debt.  If these entities were to default the Federal reserve would likely need to act with quantitative easing to preserve the financial system and correct for any capital destruction.  


There are a few options to deal with this;  


1) The Treasury provides bailouts, and benefits sufficient to prevent defaults using bonds that the Federal Reserve has purchased using freshly created capital, leaving a debt on the federal government's books.  


2) The Federal reserve pushes interest rates to 0 or negative using freshly created capital, enabling entities to acquire bridge loans, and rollover debt to avoid bankruptcy.  Some of the freshly created capital is distributed to the financial sector in the form of fees and interest rates - and entities have to grow their balance sheet.  Individuals and some corporations will go bust due to failing loan eligibility requirements, or failing to meet them in sufficient time.  


3) The Federal reserve directly pays loan servicers for debts, either fully or partially for a finite period of time - Entities balance sheets shrink, and financiers are kept whole, however freshly created capital is fully disbursed into the economy - and can't be easily taken back without rate hikes, and increased reserve requirements.  


4) The Federal reserve directly distributes capital to individuals, for a finite period of time - to counter the deflationary effect on demand.  Consumers in turn distribute capital to business entities and allow them to continue basic operations.  Entities balance sheets shrink, some corporations (airlines) and hard to reach individuals go bust due to persistent lack of demand during a pandemic.  


While options 1 &amp; 2 are actively in use, I haven't seen any thoughts towards options 3 &amp; 4.  Has there been research on the legality/practical effect of a central bank directly distributing capital to individuals to increase the money supply and fight deflation?",finance

investing,CNBC: Negative rates come to the US: 1-month and 3-month Treasury bill yields are now below zero,"The coronavirus crisis has brought another first to U.S. financial markets — negative yields on government debt.

Yields on both the one-month and three-month Treasury bills dipped below zero Wednesday, a week and a half after the Federal Reserve cuts its benchmark rate to near-zero and as investors have flocked to the safety of fixed income amid general market turmoil.

It was the first time that happened in 4½ years, when both bills briefly flashed red and yields fell to minus-0.002% each. The readings Wednesday were well below those.

“This is part and parcel of the whole flight to quality thing,” said Kim Rupert, managing director of global fixed income at Action Economics. “They’re obviously the most liquid instrument. We saw a lot of selling pressure a few days ago when everyone was selling everything to get cash. But with all the plans the Fed has introduced, the bill market is much safer.”

The U.S. now joins large swaths of Europe and Japan that also have negative-yielding debt.

In Germany, the move was even more prevalent, with all government fixed income instruments except the 30-year bond carrying rates below zero. Denmark, France and Sweden are among other European nations also in the category.

Negative yields are largely a function of demand, as prices and yields move in opposite direction for bonds. Investors pay a large premium above par on the bonds and can receive less than their initial investment at maturity. Deposit rates also can be negative.

The negative rates, however, are not directly related to central bank policy. Fed officials have rejected the notion that the U.S. central bank might eventually take its policy rate below zero.

However, that might not matter if current market trends hold. While longer-duration Treasurys are still a good ways from negative territory, the trend for yields is lower.

“There’s no telling anymore in this environment. They could spread,” Rupert said. “Everyone is expecting the Fed to be lower for longer, and I mean longer.  The whole bias is for yields to go lower. I would not rule out the front end of the curve going negative.”

personalfinance,Refinance or not,"So about 18 months ago I bought a brand new vehicle. Yeah yeah yeah I know never buy brand new but here we are. I was in a pinch at the time, the car I had was financially upside down also a total loss and no gap insurance coverage. All that said rebates on my truck covered 98% of the negative equity. Pair that with my down payment at the time and I came out about $2000 under sticker except the note was 84 months (I know I know). My credit at the time was 150 points lower than it is now and with current interest rate offerings I could theoretically reduce my interest by 1.5-3% and reduce the length of the loan by 3 years. Currently I’m paying more than the monthly required amount but at my current pace would only reduce my loan my 6 months. I have a healthy savings and refinancing would increase the (required) monthly payment $300, and about $150 over what I currently pay. If my math is correct, my payment would increase but my savings in interest alone would be over $7000. Can anyone tell me what I might be overlooking? Good idea? Bad idea? Thoughts?

personalfinance,Should I refinance student loans with loan forgiveness program?,"I am finishing up my Masters degree and I work for the government so I qualify for the ten year loan forgiveness program. I have been making qualifying payments on my undergrad loans (about 10k) for two years. Those loans have a pretty low interest rate of 3.5%, but the way the program is formulated I would actually pay off the loans before the forgiveness. However, my masters degree loans (40k) are still in deferment and have a high interest rate of 6.5%. The loan forgiveness program seems set up to have you pay off the loans in ten years so you do not get much of a deal. When I first started the program and started taking out loans my income was small enough to where my monthly payments would have been low (income based repayment) so it made sense, but I now make too much money to get a deal on the monthly payments. Would it make more sense to take out a low interest loans for the entire amount and pay them off to save a substantial amount of money in interest? If I took a loan of 45k out of pay the loans what would my monthly payment be? I have very good credit but I also have a mortgage and other monthly payments.",finance

Is it a good idea to take out home equity to pay student loans? I have a mortgage balance of 230 at an interest rate of 3.7%. Value of the home is ~450K. It's a 30 year loan with 25 years left. I have a student loan of 200K at 6.8%. This is down from 300 K with aggressive payments. I am in the medical field and will be going back to training again for minimum of 2 years. During that time, I'll be making 3.5-4k a month. It will be enough to pay mortgage, utilities and some towards loan payment, likely just interest on the loan but not much more. My plan was to take out at least 70 K in equity and pay towards the student loan to decrease the balance significantly where I could afford to make payments with my new income. With the mortgage refinance, I'm hoping to get a 3-3.5% interest rate on a 20 year loan (this would be 5 year shorter than the term I have now). My mortgage payment will go up but the loan term is reduced. I am still not sure if it's a good idea to pay one debt with another one . Please advise me.

I'm a small business owner and while I'm OK during this time, I was curious what the process was like or what they were offering. I'm also a financial coach and wanted to give my clients a head's up of what to expect if they were thinking of pursuing this option. 

I called and was informed that I could apply for a 90-day protection, which essentially meant no penalties, fees or negative credit reporting for 90 days. Sounds nice but...

**Concern #1: They wouldn't provide me with any documentation in writing until after I applied.**

I then asked about what happens after 90 days and the Customer Service Rep could not tell me. Granted, I do believe she simply doesn't know and this situation is new for many of us. 

I then asked ""What have you heard MIGHT happen after 90 days?""

She then said she's heard it's based off the investor of the loan so it will be up to them but she's heard of 3 possibilities:

1) The 3 payments get added to the back of the loan (essentially extending it for 3 months)

2) The amount missed gets added to the balance and is capitalized.

**3) You will have to make the back payments or be forced to do a loan mod.** 

That last option is troubling for a lot of people and I have a feeling they don't realize it until the time comes. She was not able to tell me if the interest rate would be different or what the modification would look like. For us, we have a great interest rate and a loan mod could result in a dramatic difference over the life of our loan as far as interest is concerned.

I chose not to move forward with the application until there's a more concrete plan or policy on how these will be handled on the back end (after 90 days). 

My concern is that a lot of people will not consider ""what's next"" when looking for help today with their financial stress. They will simply jump at the chance to postpone their largest bill - kicking the can down the street and possibly creating a bigger problem later.

Not every bank is the same so please make sure you encourage people to ASK what happens with these missed payments after 90 days. Be aware of the LONG-TERM impact as well as the SHORT-TERM with these kinds of things! 

There were so many loan mods back in '08 &amp; '09 that were disastrous for borrowers. Please let's not repeat that mistake with Coronavirus.",finance

personalfinance,"Retirement, Student Loan Debt, Emergency Fund, Education, Down Payment? – Can’t Do It All","Hi everyone,

I consider myself to be pretty financially stable, but with recent events I realize that I would like to eliminate my liabilities more quickly, but I am having a difficult time letting go of funding my retirement in favor of building an emergency fund and leaving debt more quickly. My situation is a little different than most people’s, so a lot of advice I’ve found doesn’t make as much sense (such as Dave Ramsey’s snowball method, since I have \*one\* source of debt).

Important things to know:

**25F, single, living in Boston, avid YNABer.**

**Last year:** Salary was \~55k, I contributed the full $6k to my ROTH IRA, refinanced my private loan (again) to get a lower interest rate. I contributed nothing to an emergency fund but never lacked for money or dealing with emergencies like an ER visit and ongoing weekly physical therapy for a few months.

**This year so far:** Salary will be just shy of 60k. On track to make $6k ROTH IRA contribution, satisfied with private loan (switched to biweekly payments, taking an additional $50/mo beyond minimum payment), began emergency fund. Current emergency fund is at $1.5k. 

**Beyond:** I am guaranteed a COL adjustment and a roughly 3% salary increase each year, so as of right now my salary will cap out at $80k/yr without any change in education status. A second masters’ is a 5k/yr salary bump while a CAGS or PhD is a 10k bump over my current salary step, but I cannot complete a CAGS or PhD without taking a leave of absence from teaching. I can complete a second masters’ while maintaining my job. I do not forsee myself leaving my job or the field of education anytime soon. I recently started a relationship, but nothing serious yet and am not planning on having biological children (but am not opposed to fostering or adoption given my field).

**What prompted change**

My job just announced a surprise partnership with Landed to support teachers in saving for down payments and home ownership is a distant goal of mine, which means I need to A) get out of debt faster and B) be prepared for emergencies. I am also thinking about moving up the salary ladder, which requires me to complete a second masters’ degree or a CAGS/PhD (lmao?) that I would have to pay for out of pocket. The CAGS is a better choice for our salary ladder but does not make sense for my career goals and is less attainable. Meanwhile, after many disappointing searches I have finally identified an excellent option for a second masters’ that would cost $7500 at worst that I could do over the summer and over a few years. 

My goals were just starting to shift when suddenly COVID-19 appeared. It has understandably rattled me, even though my job Is extremely secure. I would like to save one month’s salary as an emergency fund for now given the stability of my job, then move on to my next goal.

Regardless, the reality is I can’t do all of these things (retirement, pay student loan faster, save a down payment, save an emergency fund, possibly save for more schooling) at the same time, especially when my IBR payments go back up in November/December. Due to COVID, I am also no longer saving for some of my wishes (a trip to Canada and NYC this summer). Basically, I now have a \~6 month window to aggressively put my ducks in a row before life returns to normal.

**Financials**

**Monthly Net Pay: $3423 + 2 month lump sum payment in June (I am a teacher, so I get four paychecks at the end of June and that is my July and August “pay”)**

**Debts:**

**Federal loan: $10/mo,** $72k @ 5.2% (mostly GradPLUS). Unusually low because for the tax year this was calculated in I had only worked for 3 months, but will go up around November/December. I received my PSLF certification in the mail recently to confirm that I am paying correctly towards forgiveness**. PSLF forgiveness date is December 2028.**

**Private loan (Earnest): $650/mo in biweekly payments,** balance is 60k @ 4.8%. Minimum payment is $600/mo. Payoff **December 2030.**

I hold no other debt, credit score is 760. Cards are paid in full at every billing statement.

Because of PSLF, there is nothing to snowball here. The only option is to put more money towards my loans or save.

**All Essential Monthly Expenses (includes loan payments, does not include retirement or emergency fund savings): $2800**

**The Decision:**

Basically, I have $600 each month to distribute between retirement savings, emergency fund savings, and paying off my private loan faster *right this very moment*. Previously, I had been putting $500 into my ROTH IRA and $100 into my emergency fund, but I suspect this course is not prudent anymore. 

If I throw all of this money towards my emergency fund (plus that $1200 check coming in the mail soon), I could fund a one month’s salary emergency fund and then go balls to the wall at my private loan for 5 years and knock it out, without saving much money for a down payment, retirement, OR more schooling. I think this would give me peace of mind but I would also be missing out on some extra pay. 

A third option is to aggressively fund an emergency fund, then pay a little bit extra ($100/mo) towards my loans while also saving aggressively and paying to begin a second masters’. I could start this summer and have 5 years to finish but could do so sooner.

Compared to most other people my age, I can afford financial risk: I am a teacher in an extremely high-demand subject and very happy with my job (and if this changes, could get a new job tomorrow), am up for tenure next year (with no indication that I will not receive it), and have seniority in my department. Still, one can never be too cautious, especially in these times.

How would you attack this situation?

Thank you in advance.",finance

My first payment came in today and it was $84,000.  I'm losing 25% to my reps and lawyer's commission fees, and then I'm paying off $10k of credit card debt. This leaves me with $53,000 I have no idea what to do with. I can also expect three more payments of $12,000 in the coming months, but 25% will go to commission fees from each of these payments, so it's more like payments of $9,000.

Before I got this money I was on unemployment and living paycheck to paycheck with the occasional freelance job. I haven't saved much at all. I have $6000 in a ROTH IRA and a small stock portfolio I day trade with for fun that is worth about $1300 (from a $400 investment). I have a Goldman Sachs Marcus High Yield savings account with $200 in it.

I'm wondering if I should max out my IRA contribution now, or if that's a bad idea with the market tanking the way it is. Should I stash my estimated tax bill in the Marcus account? I've read you're technically losing money if you put it in a saving account as the interest rate doesn't keep up with inflation. If that's true, where would you recommend I put my money?

vet,Need extra advice,"I've spoken with my vet earlier today. They're closed now. I'd like more perspective and am hoping to be able to get some more advice before they open again tomorrow. 

My dog threw up two days in a row. (Yesterday and the day before.) She was fed around 8 pm and threw up around 1 am, give or take an hour. She was able to hold down breakfast the second day, so I was hopeful she was getting better. The food--both times-- was almost the same as it was when ingested. The first time it was just a small portion of her food. The second time it was most of what she ate. There was a bit of mucus on it. 

I was afraid she had a blockage, but she's pooped normally. Then she had diarrhea earlier today. 

Today she's been very subdued. Still shows interest in food, but turns away before eating. She ate a bit of carrot (I didn't give it to her) but I don't think it stayed down. I'm a bit distressed because she was still eating yesterday. 

I gave her half a pepcid ac as per the vet's advice, and she doesn't seem to be feeling any better. She's mostly just been lying on the ground outside. Her eyes are pretty squinty. She's just acted tired all day. 

We made boiled chicken and rice for her. She tried to eat the rice and spat it out.

She's on heart medication for congestive heart failure. Pimobendan, furosemide, and spironalactone. She's had blood work in the past week or so, and her kidney levels were a bit elevated. Vet said it could be nitrogen waste buildup. 

Should I forgo the meds tonight? She had them this morning. I don't want to because they really seem to be helping her heart, but she's gone almost 24 hours without food now. A bit of peanut butter with her meds. That's it. 

She's about 10 years old. She's a Maltipoo. 

Can I help with the waste buildup in any way? Would goat milk help? I don't know if I can even find any with all that's going on. 

I thought that it might be too many chicken feet at first. Only one a day, but I know now I should have cut back on that. She had blue buffalo treats for the first time shortly before this all started, and that's the only new thing in her diet. It was a very small treat. 

I don't know if she picked up any sort of pesticide from outside by walking on the grass. I guess I should've wiped her paws off. We've never had this problem before so I didn't think to do it.  

Thank y'all for your time. I would appreciate knowing about anything I can do for her here at home.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,I can't figure out why Chase reduced my mortgage rate.,"Right now I have a 3.875% 30-year non-conforming jumbo mortgage with Chase that I took out in June 2017.  When interest rates started dropping in January/February, I called up my mortgage broker at Chase, who was able to match a rate a CU was offering at 3.5% with only a few hundred of closing costs.  I locked that in and preceded to underwriting, and was ultimately approved.  As of a few days ago, our closing was supposed to take place on April 5.  The Chase broker calls me up today and says I will be getting a letter in the mail today offering, instead of the refi, to do a mortgage modification of my existing mortgage down to 3.25%, no closing costs.  He says this came down from his bosses, he doesn't understand why they are doing it and that he has never seen this happen before.  He said the offer is generally going out to Chase customers with non-conforming loans in the refi pipeline.  I check my mail today, and there is the offer letter as promised.

Aside from celebrating my good luck (knocks about $200 off my P&amp;I a month), I am trying to figure out why Chase did this?  I think my existing mortgage is on their books, so maybe they like the credit there? The whole thing is confusing to me.

The coronavirus shutdown is hammering supply and demand across the globe. That has forced the real economy into a sharp recession and triggered a rolling financial crisis. Below is a primer on one key piece of this mess: the crisis in corporate debt markets. This branch of finance is vitally important because even healthy companies often need access to credit. If they do not get it, they go under.

In 2008, the vector of crisis ran from mortgage-backed securities to the rest of the financial sector and then to the real economy. This time, the real economy is being hit directly, and the damage is reverberating back into financial markets.  The failing markets, in feedback-loop fashion, further threaten the real economy as corporations find it harder to borrow. As the corporate debt markets sour, major companies will go bankrupt. Unemployment is skyrocketing. Some analysts expect the economy to contract by an annualized rate of 30 percent during the second quarter of 2020.

Already, US financial markets are on public life support. The Federal Reserve has committed to unlimited purchases of all sorts of assets: US Treasuries, mortgage-backed securities, car loans, municipal debts, and, in a historic step, both short term and long-term corporate debt. But the crisis will require more than a financial rescue.

The key political question now is: What sort of controls will come with the state intervention? Corporate greed and self-dealing need to be checked not merely in the name of fairness but also to make sure public bailout money is actually invested in the real economy rather than just gambled away, as it was after the 2008 crash and rescue.

###The Rise of Corporate Debt

Since 2008, household debt levels have actually declined and are now lower than they were going into the last crash. But not corporate debt. Measured as a firm’s “net debt” compared to its EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization), corporate debt has doubled since the last crash. In 2009, the average American company owed $2 of debt for every $1 in earnings. Today, the average firm carries net debt to EBITDA of 3 to 1, and many firms — like Ford Motor, CarMax, Harley-Davidson, and General Motors — carry ratios ranging from 8 to 1, to as high as 15 to 1. Boeing, a special case because of its 737 MAX crisis, carries a ratio of 37 to 1.

Over the last two decades, corporate America’s credit rating has collapsed. In the early ’90s, more than sixty companies held AAA credit ratings. Today, only two US firms are AAA rated: Johnson &amp; Johnson and Microsoft. In 2001, fewer than one in five “investment-grade” firms were rated BBB. Today half of all investment-grade corporate debt belongs to firms rated “triple-B” (BBB) or lower. A third of those firms are rated triple-B minus (BBB-), one notch away from speculative or “junk” status.

Already many triple-B-rated corporate bonds are trading on secondary markets at unusually low prices and high yields, often above 5 percent; that means even “investment grade” bonds are being treated as junk. Soon many triple-B-rated corporations will be formally downgraded to junk. That will drive up their borrowing costs and restrict their access to credit. Even healthy companies often need access to ready credit. If they do not get it, they go under.

The rating agency Moody’s estimates the default rate for “speculative-grade” debt — companies with ratings lower than Baa from Moody’s Investors Service, or a rating lower than BBB from Standard &amp; Poor’s — might reach 10 percent this year, up from 2.3 percent last year. The consequences of all this will reverberate throughout the wider economy, deepening and extending the recession.

Total global corporate debt, including bonds and loans, is approximately $66 trillion; more than double what it was a decade ago. For comparison, the combined gross national product of all economies was estimated at $80.27 trillion in 2017. About a quarter of that is the US economy.

###What They Did With the Money

After the 2008 crash, the world’s central banks, with the US Federal Reserve in the lead, spent the next decade pushing money into the financial markets by way of super-low interest rates and the direct public purchase of financial assets from the private sector via quantitative easing (QE).

The cheap credit encouraged lots of corporate borrowing in the form of loans from banks and massive issuance of corporate bonds. Unlike loans, which can be routinely extended, or sometimes abruptly terminated, or have interest rates that float up and down, corporate bonds are debt instruments issued by a company committing to repay borrowed money on a specified schedule at a specified, usually fixed, rate of interest.

Corporations have been borrowing for a variety of reasons that range from shrewd arbitrage to stupid and reckless asset stripping. For a struggling and unprofitable company, for example JCPenney, debt can be a lifeline. For a profitable firm, borrowing money can be a way to raise capital without diluting existing shareholders’ claim on the company’s profits, which would happen if the firm issued stock.

Even some profitable firms with piles of cash borrowed rather than spend their cash, in part for the firepower effect: letting other competitors and market entrants know that the firm has enough money on hand to buy out any threatening start-ups, and showing the world the firm is ready to ride out any economic crisis.

Some firms used their borrowed money to buy other firms. This helped fuel a post-2008 wave of mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;As). Deloitte reported “more than $10 trillion in [M&amp;A] domestic transactions since 2013.” Targeted companies borrowed to stockpile cash as a defense against such takeovers.

Firms also borrowed to fund CEO compensation, distributions to investors via dividends, and stock buybacks. Companies buy back their own stock so as to boost its price. A rising stock price is useful in many ways: it can keep away hostile raiders by making a targeted company too expensive to take over, but it can also draw in friendly suitors because (with some creative accounting) a rising stock value can make a weak firm appear more profitable. Corporate executives like a rising stock price because compensation packages are both tied to stock performance and almost always include some payment in company stock, so the higher the stock price, the higher the executives’ payout.

Sometimes, firms even invested their borrowed money in actual production. The capital-intensive oil and gas industry did that, but as we explain below, it still faces a crisis, perhaps more salient than other sectors.

###Bad Credit as Perverse Incentive

The end result of all the borrowing was declining corporate credit-worthiness: corporate debt soon badly outpaced their earnings growth and cash balances. This led to widespread credit-rating downgrades.

Perversely, lower credit ratings did not slow the borrowing binge, but rather spurred on further lending and borrowing, because as corporate credit ratings slipped, the interest rate that the downgraded firms had to pay on their loans and bonds increased. And, thus, so too did the lenders’ profits.

Corporate debt and stock prices entered into a twisted dialectic, each driving the other. As the stock market continued to inflate over the last decade, it provided the confidence investors required to continue their purchases of risky corporate bonds.

Keep in mind that many of the lending banks and asset funds were actually or essentially borrowing from Uncle Sam at inflation-adjusted rates close to zero, then lending to companies with triple-B and triple-B minus ratings at 5 percent interest. Profits like that meant there were always banks and asset funds eager to lend to debt-burdened corporations.

Investors could directly purchase specific corporations’ bonds, or, as is more often the case, invest in mutual funds or exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that target an array of corporate bonds. High-risk loans were also sliced and diced and repackaged into bundles called “collateralized loan obligations” (CLOs), a class of securities backed by an underlying portfolio of corporate loans.

According to the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, the majority of American CLOs are held by US institutional investors, including insurance companies, mutual funds, and depository institutions. This means that when the debt is unable to be serviced, the pain will be absorbed within the US economy, much of it by the unassuming customers of these financial behemoths.

As was the case with the mortgage-backed securities of the 2008 crash, these funds helped “distribute risk” and thus gave an appearance of safety. The logic was that owning 1 percent of a hundred different loans would be safer, even if some loans went bad, than owning the entirety of a single debt security. The logic is not entirely wrong. And that is part of the problem: it encouraged yet more lending. As long as the economic forecast was optimistic, there was no reason for the debt spree to let up.

###Zombies and Others

Corporate debt, like much of the economy, is a story of disparities. Not every corporation is burdened by debt. Some firms are actually awash in cash. Microsoft, Berkshire Hathaway, Alphabet Inc, and Apple each sit on more than $100 billion in cash. As a whole, corporate America has been sitting on record amounts of cash in recent years. But at the same time, Morgan Stanley Investment Management estimates that one in six US companies cannot cover even the interest payments on their debts.

At the heart of the problem are “leveraged loans” and so-called zombie firms. Leveraged loans are a type of expensive, high-risk credit extended to already heavily indebted companies. Since the 2008 crash, the leveraged loan market has doubled to $1.2 trillion. Now, leveraged loans in the United States are being re-sold at only 84 cents on the dollar, their lowest price since August 2009. The majority of leveraged loans — more than half — are in the form of the aforementioned CLOs. In the fourth quarter of 2018, there were $617 billion of CLOs outstanding.

Zombie firms are defined by the Bank for International Settlements as heavily indebted, well-established companies that have failed to be profitable over an extended period and have low expected profitability in the future. In other words, heavily indebted start-ups do not qualify as zombies. The most threatened sectors are energy, automotive, insurance, capital goods (meaning equipment and machinery), telecoms, aerospace and defense, and some parts of retail.

The bull market of rising, often overvalued, stock prices allowed many uncompetitive and unprofitable companies to appear healthy based solely on their stock’s performance. Even before the markets started to crash on March 9, some analysts were prescient enough to call the market’s bluff at the beginning of the year.

But in this rapidly developing crisis, firms all across the economy may soon find it impossible to meet their liabilities. With the coronavirus breaking supply chains and forcing massive constrictions in consumer demand, corporate earnings are contracting fast, which in turn will badly hurt corporate debt servicing.

Like a hypertrophied organ rupturing, the putrefaction of unsustainable corporate debt now threatens to create a generalized economic sepsis that will hurt even healthy firms.

###Profiles in Debt

Airlines. The top six major US airlines spent enormous sums to buy back their stock over the last decade. US airlines (as a whole) spent 96 percent of their borrowed money on buying back stock. Now, revenue from flights is plummeting. United Airlines’ bookings have fallen by 70 percent. Back in 2011, American Airlines filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy with $29 billion in liabilities; today, they have over $34 billion in debt. Yields on some of their bonds reached a whopping 12 percent, a particularly distressing sign as interest rates have been slashed by the Fed in an effort to relieve credit markets.

Energy. Even before the effects of coronavirus eviscerated demand for fossil fuels, US energy companies were suffering due to high fixed costs and low energy prices. In the last five years, 208 US energy companies have declared bankruptcy. Energy prices have been pushed down by the fracking revolution, the rise of renewable energy, and oil overproduction due to struggles between large producers like Saudi Arabia, Russia, and the United States.

Now the coronavirus shock is pushing firms over the edge. Occidental Petroleum — which has $40 billion in debt, while its market value (the value of all of its stocks combined) is less than $11 billion — recently had its debt downgraded to junk.

Energy mutual funds reveal the crisis in the energy sector as a whole. Vanguard Energy Fund, considered one of the top four oil mutual funds, has lost over 41 percent of its value since the beginning of the year. Of course, the biggest oil companies, the “Oil Majors” (such as BP, Exxon Mobil, and Royal Dutch Shell) have enough resources, market power, and government support to survive the crisis. But the effects on the less established firms stretch beyond the energy industry itself.

Lenders. As the oil and gas firms go into crisis, the banks that extended them credit may also face defaults. Loans outstanding to the petroleum sector from regional banks in North America exceed $100 billion. Banks financing oil companies in Texas and Oklahoma saw their share prices drop nearly 30 percent. In oil-dependent states, public budgets will hurt as tax revenues decline sharply.

Retail. A number of important retailers carry net debt to EBITDA ratios that are too high to be sustainable under current conditions. For example, Rite Aid owes $15.80 for every dollar it earns. For JCPenney, the ratio is $8.30 to $1; for Walgreens Boots Alliance, it is $5.80 to $1. Office Depot owes $4.60 compared to every dollar earned.

###Beyond Bailout

Bailing out distressed companies, even taking them under public ownership for a while, may staunch the bleeding. And the bubble can eventually be reinflated with enough effort. But a replay of the 2008 bailout, which involved lots of public money but very little public regulation and planning, will only mean a long slump followed by a bubble for the rich.

The American economy is a sick beast. It needs not only government handouts and ownership — which it is getting — it also needs planning.

Oil, airlines, and cruise ships — these are high-emission industries that, in the face of climate crisis, must be radically transformed or cease to exist. With government ownership and planning, these industries could be unwound and their resources redeployed.

Although COVID-19 set off our current recession, it was the indulgence of the 1 percent built into the 2008 rescue that is responsible for the depth and severity of our current economic crisis. Without guidance, money was poured into the financial system. Not surprisingly, it blossomed alongside the mutually reinforcing dynamic of artificially inflated stock prices and ballooning corporate debt.

Capitulation to the gluttony of financiers is deeply unjust. But it is also unworkable in purely technical terms. Without constraints on greed, there will be another bubble and crash and a longer slump, more suffering, greater inequality, and more social instability. We have to force government to use its legal and financial power to steer the American economy toward more egalitarian, socially rational, and environmentally sustainable purposes. We have to make this bailout work for the majority of us.

#Corporate Socialism: The Government is Bailing Out Investors &amp; Managers Not You


The U.S. government is enacting measures to save the airlines, Boeing, and similarly affected corporations. While we clearly insist that these companies must be saved, there may be ethical, economic, and structural problems associated with the details of the execution. As a matter of fact, if you study the history of bailouts, there will be.



The bailouts of 2008–9 saved the banks (but mostly the bankers), thanks to the execution by then-treasury secretary Timothy Geithner who fought for bank executives against both Congress and some other members of the Obama administration. Bankers who lost more money than ever earned in the history of banking, received the largest bonus pool in the history of banking less than two years later, in 2010. And, suspiciously, only a few years later, Geithner received a highly paid position in the finance industry.

That was a blatant case of corporate socialism and a reward to an industry whose managers are stopped out by the taxpayer. The asymmetry (moral hazard) and what we call optionality for the bankers can be expressed as follows: heads and the bankers win, tails and the taxpayer loses. Furthermore, this does not count the policy of quantitative easing that went to inflate asset values and increased inequality by benefiting the super rich. Remember that bailouts come with printed money, which effectively deflate the wages of the middle class in relation to asset values such as 
ultra-luxury apartments in New York City.

The Generalized Bob Rubin Trade: Keep the profits, transfer losses to taxpayers. Named after Bob Rubin who pocketed 120 million dollars from Citi but claimed uncertainty and kept past bonuses. This encourages anyone to never be insured for such eventualities since the government will pick up the tab.

####If It’s Bailed Out, It’s a Utility

First, we must not conflate airlines as a physical company with the financial structure involved. Nor should we conflate the fate of the employees of the airlines with the unemployment of our fellow citizens, which can be directly compensated rather than indirectly via leftovers of corporate subsidies. We should learn from the Geithner episode that bailing out individuals based on their needs is not the same as bailing out corporations based on our need for them.

Saving an airline, therefore, should not equate to subsidizing their shareholders and highly compensated managers and promote additional moral hazard in society. For the very fact that we are saving airlines indicates their role as utility. And if as such they are necessary for society, then why do their managers have optionality? Are civil servants on a bonus scheme? The same argument must also be made, by extension, against indirectly bailing out the pools of capital, like hedge funds and endless investment strategies, that are so exposed to these assets; they have no honest risk mitigation strategy, other than a trained naïve reliance on bailouts or what’s called in the industry the “government put”.

Second, these corporations are lobbying for bailouts, which they will eventually get thanks to the pressure they can exert on the government via lobby units. But how about the small corner restaurant ? The independent tour guide ? The personal trainer? The massage professional? The barber? The hotdog vendor living from tourists near the Met Museum ? These groups cannot afford lobbyists and will be ignored.

####Buffers Not Debt

Third, as we have been warning since 2006, companies need buffers to face uncertainty –not debt (an inverse buffer), but buffers. Mother nature gave us two kidneys when we only need about a portion of a single one. Why? Because of contingency. We do not need to predict specific adverse events to know that a buffer is a must. Which brings us to the buyback problem. Why should we spend taxpayer money to bailout companies who spent their cash (and often even borrowed to generate that cash) to buy their own stock (so the CEO gets optionality), instead of building a rainy day buffer? Such bailouts punish those who acted conservatively and harms them in the long run, favoring the fool and the rent-seeker.

####Not a Black Swan

Furthermore, some people claim that the pandemic is a “Black Swan”, hence something unexpected so not planning for it is excusable. The book they commonly cite is The Black Swan. Had they read that book, they would have known that such a global pandemic is explicitly presented there as a white swan: something that would eventually take place with great certainty. Such acute pandemic is unavoidable, the result of the structure of the modern world; and its economic consequences would be compounded because of the increased connectivity and overoptimization. As a matter of fact, the government of Singapore, whom we advised in the past, was prepared for such an eventuality with a precise plan since as early as 2010.

investing,Pension and Asset Allocation Rebalances Incoming?,"Back in the mini-crisis of 2018, the final catalyst that ended things after the fed started easing and China trade looked less horrific was the pension funds doing massive re-balance trades the day after Christmas, coinciding with year and quarter end. We were up over 7% if I recall correctly, and the days following were strong too. 

We may be seeing a little bit of that now. Volume was healthy today, and we are less than a week from quarter end, just like last time. 

I'm not particularly bullish on this market, but that could be a strong technical buying trend that pushes us higher as long as there's not more-catastrophic-than-expected news. Also, we have a number of positive tailwinds - Italy cases flattening, bill passing, fed kicking in finally.

Anyone see anything that looks distinctively pensioney, like those giant block trades in '18? (I don't know why some people can't learn to use VWAP, unless the whole point is to cause a melt-up). I also wonder if Tuesday was this at work...  But, pensions would still be under-allocated significantly at these price levels, and might be shy to pull the gun with inv grade credit markets really broken a few days ago, but gradually improving. 

Anecdotally, I have several high net worth friends who wanted to rebalance this week but could not because they couldn’t get fair values for individual bonds they have. I have to imagine a lot of that is corporations also dumping their fixed income securities to have cash on hand or switch to t-bills. But with the fed firehosing liquidity into the credit markets that is rapidly improving - which eventually facilitates rebalance.",finance

personalfinance,[MA] Can losses as a Real Estate Professional be carried forward on Massachusetts state taxes?,"We live in NY and I have W2 income in NY. Last year we bought an investment property in MA, listed it on Airbnb and my wife manages the rentals. Based on the amount of time she puts in, she legitimately meets the Real Estate Professional qualifications. We did a major renovation when we bought the place and didn't get our first rental until the end of the year, so we have significant losses.

If my wife takes the election as a Real Estate Professional, then all of those losses can be used to offset my W2 income on our federal return. However, for state purposes: my W2 income is in NY, and the loss from the rental is in MA. So there's nothing in MA to offset (other than a tiny amount of rental income) and the state return will be left with a big net loss.

Will MA allow that loss to be carried forward, to offset rental income in future years? Is it ok to ""use up"" the whole loss on our federal return but carry most of it forward for MA purposes?",finance

I'm not bothered about recieving a $1200 check, because that doesn't even pay one month of mortgage for most of us.

That would take a massive burden off the people in most need whole we navigate this chaos.

But reading this bill, it seems they've only done this to 'federally back mortgages'. 

As someone with a conventional loan (when I got my mortgage I just did what the broker told me, I had no idea there was even a difference), am I just fucked now?

I called chase and they said they won't help me until I've missed 3 months of payments. At which point my credit is fucked and I'm in debt...

solar,Senergy Solar Company door to door?,"Anyone worked with Senergy Solar company before?

He said they use Silfab monochrystalline panels and they have a deal where interest is not applied until 18 months but they expect us to use our federal tax credit to pay off principal in the loan before the loan amortizes and the quoted interest rate applies (2.9%). Otherwise the rate goes up if you don’t use the tax credit to pay off principal. Haven’t seen the other numbers yet but we only go over 100 kWh two months out of the year (Arizona in summer).

personalfinance,Higher mortgage rate vs. higher one time refund,"Hi all,

Looking for some validation on my thought process here and to see if I'm understanding everything the pros and cons of my options on a mortgage rate with a refund

Details:

Mortgage - 700k, 30 year fixed

Options -

* 3.5% rate with a .1% rebate on mortgage amount = $700 refund at $3,143 monthly
* 3.75% rate with a 1.35% rebate on mortgage amount = $9450 refund at $3,242 monthly
At this rate, if I opt for the higher rebate, it would take 88 months before the higher interest rate will outweigh the higher refund amount.

($9450 - $700) / ($3,243 - $3,143) = 88 months

I'm leaning for the higher rate due to the refund amount because I'm assuming I can refinance back to the 3.5% rate within 88 months.

Can someone help confirm the following risks of going this route, and point out anything I'm missing here?

* Rates don't go down within the 88 months and I lose more money to interest
* Refi costs reduce the 88 month break even point that will effectively lower my initial refund",finance

UniSwap,Need your input! Trade your collateral.,"Hello!

My friends and I are working on a platform ""Deflast"" to trade Compound collaterals with flash loan. The idea is to free up collaterals and to better leverage those assets.

The idea is to solve the below problems:

1. **Currently, if your collateral is depreciating, you could try to stop-loss by a few steps**: Repay your debt -&gt; withdraw your collateral -&gt; Swap your collateral to a less-depreciated asset -&gt; deposit this new collateral -&gt; get a new loan with the new collateral. ===&gt; Several steps involved (time++), several transactions involved (cost++), not to mention that you can only do these with at least 2 platforms (Compound + Uniswap for example).
2. **Currently, if the saving interest rate of your collateral is lowering, you could try to increase the rate by a few steps:** Repay your debt -&gt; withdraw your collateral -&gt; Swap your collateral to an asset with a higher saving rate -&gt; deposit this new collateral -&gt; get a new loan with the new collateral. ===&gt; Several steps involved (time++), several transactions involved (cost++), not to mention that you can only do these with at least 2 platforms (Compound + Uniswap for example).

**How it works?**

Once you decide how much collateral you want to trade, our platform will do the follows:

1. We call flash loan to borrow extra capital.
2. Deposit this extra capital to your Compound account.
3. Withdraw your original Compound collateral.
4. Swap your Compound collateral to the asset you preferred.
5. Repay the capital back to flash loan.
6. Deposit the rest capital back to your Compound account.

All these steps will be completed in 1 single transaction. Save your time and save your collateral.

The smart contract is ready, and the website is coming soon. We will start from the collaterals on Compound, but the concepts can work on other platforms as well and we aim to integrate them all.

**How do you think about this? Any comment is highly appreciated ;)**

2. **Currently, if the saving interest rate of your collateral is lowering, you could try to increase the rate by a few steps:** Repay your debt -&gt; withdraw your collateral -&gt; Swap your collateral to an asset with a higher saving rate -&gt; deposit this new collateral -&gt; get a new loan with the new collateral. ===&gt; Several steps involved (time++), several transactions involved (cost++), not to mention that you can only do these with at least 2 platforms (Compound + Uniswap for example).

**How it works?**

Once you decide how much collateral you want to trade, our platform will do the follows:

1. We call flash loan to borrow extra capital.
2. Deposit this extra capital to your Compound account.
3. Withdraw your original Compound collateral.
4. Swap your Compound collateral to the asset you preferred.
5. Repay the capital back to flash loan.
6. Deposit the rest capital back to your Compound account.

All these steps will be completed in 1 single transaction. Save your time and save your collateral.

The smart contract is ready, and the website is coming soon. We will start from the collaterals on Compound, but the concepts can work on other platforms as well and we aim to integrate them all.

**How do you think about this? Any comment is highly appreciated ;)**

personalfinance,Noob question about adjusting withholdings for 2020,"Apologies if this has been asked to death, but I am slightly confused with how Form W4 has changed. 

I'm not the kind of person who would prefer a large tax return, and instead would prefer to use that money elsewhere. I don't want too much or too little federal tax withheld, and with the old format it used to be that I could adjust my withholdings to 1 or 2 (for a single filer with one job) and that would it be it. This year it seems a little more complicated, and I was never that tax savvy to begin with. 

I was told based on my tax situation last year (which isn't expected to change at all this year) that I could decrease my monthly amount withheld by about $120/month (or $60 per paycheck if being paid 2x/month). How would I note this on the new W4? Would this be equivalent of 1 or 2 allowances like in the past?

investing,Market Outlook - March 2020,"Hi guys, just want to share with you my current market outlook. Hope this can help spur a discussion for everybody's benefit. This is not a an investment advice. You are not my client and I am not your fiduciary. That said, the views below are just for discussion purposes.

At the risk of being cliche and obviously wrong, here I go:

**Short term-medium term:**

1. We are in a bear market, and recession is already underway.
2. Occasionally, there will be ""bear market rallies)"". For long term investors, these are not a time to buy **yet**, use it to sell instead. For traders, bear market rallies and the volatility that they bring, are great opportunities to make money. Dow Theory suggest there could be at least three bear market rallies within the overall bear market trend.
3. Reason why I think the downturn will continue for short-medium term: The USA is still early in the coronavirus infection blow out. Look at updated chart by JP Morgan and FT [here](https://ibb.co/tsSwJcg) and [here](https://www.ft.com/coronavirus-latest). The Fed is doing everything they can to keep liquidity/market functioning. The fiscal stimulus that the government is trying to pass, should dampen the blow to the economy. But, as long as the coronavirus situation i.e, the public healthcare crisis, the real crisis, is not tackled immediately through decisive action like other countries, then it will only prolong the infection period. See Bill Gate and WHO's opinions [here](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/24/bill-gates-us-missed-its-chance-to-avoid-coronavirus-shutdown.html) and [here](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-who-sees-potential-of-us-becoming-new-coronavirus-epicenter/). IMO, the market is still underestimating the coronavirus infection and the blow to the economy that it could bring given ineffective measures by the government.
4. The market could at least fall for another 15% before it starts to find a bottom based on previous bear markets.

**Longer term:**

1. Stocks would eventually go into bull market again.
2. Among the indicators that signal bottoming/reversal would be volatility (VIX) returning to normal level.
3. High quality companies, I would imagine mega-tech with pristine balance sheet, would rally first and perhaps perform the best in the upcoming bull market.

**Asset Allocation**

***Short term***: Short equity via inverse ETF, short emerging market stock/currency - especially countries with twin deficits (fiscal and trade), long gold, long treasury. Or just stay in cash.

***Risks:*** As what happened previously, gold and treasury did not provide the hedging characteristics. They went down together with stocks, while in normal condition, it they should go up. One possible explanation is that funds are liquidating any positions that they could, to satisfy redemption and margin call.

***Things to avoid: 1)*** **Options**, because options are currently trading at premium in general due to high implied volatility. Also remember that with options, you have to nail three variables to make money - direction, magnitude, and time horizon. Also, avoid **2) triple leveraged ETF/ETN.** The volatility and leveraged used in the ETFs will cause a ""decay"" in your return if the market trade sideways. As for ETN, their prices could fall to certain level that trigger ""acceleration event"" in which case, the investment banks issuing the ETNs will redeem the ETNs from you, usually at a steeply discounted price.

***Long term:*** Long equity, with overweight on mid-mega cap tech stocks.",finance

stocks,3.3 Million Jobless last week,"Thursday brings us the Initial Jobless claims for last week and it was a giant number – 3.3 Million people lost their jobs. This is double what the analysts were expecting at around 1.5 million. These are the first signs of how big the impact of this crises will be.
Meanwhile in the UK, their Central Bank kept the interest rates the same and did not extend the QE budget.
Before this news hit all world markets were down. Chinese stocks were slightly lower, -0.6%, South Korea just over 1%, with Japan leading the way, down 4.5%.
European markets got hit harder, down from 2-3% as this article is written (8 30AM ET).
US futures were down over 2% just before the news hit. After the jobless claims numbers, the markets spiked and regained 1% of their losses. This is very unusual but a great opportunity to trade.
I strongly believe the markets will go lower as trading starts, with traders accessing not just the jobless claims, but the impact to the economy.
On the virus outbreak, world numbers are continuing to raise all over the world, with potential peak in Italy as for the last 3 days number of new cases has been steady and not growing. The death toll topped 21000 and the total number of cases is expected to pass 500000 today.

For today I expect the markets to go lower, there is no reason for a green day. As I am writing I noticed that the move on the futures reversed and it is losing some of the points it got from the spike at 8 30. I do not know where markets will open, but I expect the major indexes to lose 3-4% from yesterday’s close.

China is profiting from this crisis, with incredibly strict and quick measures (which simply would not be possible in a free society) they have pretty much beaten Corona already while the US and especially Europe will be fucked for months struggling to deal with this Epidemic. After this is over I doubt we will just continue like we have. Globalisation has reached it's pinnacle a few years back. Much of our growth over the last decade was artificial, induced by low interest rates all over the world. Governemets and the financial elites have created massive imbalances in our system. Corona is just the trigger of this crash but hell, it's not making it prettier. I hate saying this but I believe Global trade won't reach the same levels it has pre-crisis.

personalfinance,Student Loan Repayment Strategy with 0% Interest,"Hi everyone,

I'm a 23-year-old young professional who graduated college last year and is looking to pay off student loans as quickly as possible. Currently my balance is $95,000 for private loans at 4.47% interest and $27,000 federal loans ranging from 3.51% to 4.80%. I pay $1100 per month on the private loans and $288 for the federal loans putting me on track to be paid off in less than 10 years.

Some other stats: I have a $56,000 salary (working from home each day, job seems pretty stable), solid emergency fund (~$18,000), 8% contribution to 401k with 5% match, and pay roughly $1050 per month for all other expenses (utilities, food, internet, gas).

While things are up in the air, the stimulus package could suspend federal loans for 6 months at 0% interest. If that goes through, which option would be more beneficial to me in the short term and long term?

1. Nothing changes - pay the same amount each month toward the private and federal loans, knowing the latter is all principal

2. Suspending the federal loans and allocating the $288 toward the private loans.

Would appreciate any input. Thanks!",finance

personalfinance,Refinancing — should I take some cash out given the current economic situation?,"Currently in a 30 year, 4.0% mortgage with ~$204K loan amount remaining. Originated in 2017, and paying PMI, though a reappraisal would get rid of that. Rate locked a 30 year, 3.0% refinance two weeks ago with $3300 in closing costs (rolled into loan). The closing costs seems high compared to others in this thread, but they're actually the most competitive I've found from local lenders -- I believe it is state specific requirements. 

The refinance is a no-brainer -- I'll reduce my payment by ~$150/month, save $20K in interest over the term of the loan and closing costs will be paid back in about 20 months. We'll be in this house for at least five years.

The curveball here is we need a new roof, to the tune of about $20k. We've saved this amount up and were ready to sign a contract, but given the current economic situation (wife's job is stable, mine is less certain), have paused. We have a 9 month emergency fund on top of the money set aside for the roof without cutting any current discretionary spending. 

Our appraisal came in very high, and we have plenty of equity in the house. Confirmed with the lender that a cash out refi as high as $50K is doable and will not affect the interest rate. 

I'm thinking of taking some cash out to to fund the roofing project (between $10-20K), and have some peace of mind should our job situation changes due to Corona that we have a long-term emergency fund. Below is a table of the various proposals, including monthly payments, total loan costs and total interest:

https://i.imgur.com/gqhoi0V.jpg

The way I look at it is -- worst case, I lose my job, but we can still put the new roof on and have a healthy emergency fund, while still reducing our monthly payment from what it is now (and with a lower total loan cost up to the $10K cash out option). Best case, both of our jobs are stable, we don't need to tap into the emergency fund, and I dump whatever sum of cash out I took right back into the mortgage once things settle down, putting me at the same trajectory should I have not taken the cash out (with a slightly higher monthly payment). Currently leaning towards the $10K cash out option, and funding the rest of the project from savings.

To me how can the market actually be efficient if an entity can artificially manipulate the price of securities. Short selling, put buying etc aren't exactly *bad* they allow the market to sort out the businesses which may or may not exist and when they fail a repurposing of capital and resources can occur to make the sector itself more efficient, sort of like killing old cells in the body so healthy ones have more energy to survive.

investing,"Crude contango, Oil tankers, Commodity traders, and you.","Some disclaimers before I start:  I’m not a financial analyst, I’m a student who’s been investing for maybe two years.   This post is long and there will be no TLDR.  If you do read this, I’d love some criticism.  I can’t poke many holes in this strategy, but if someone smarter than me can, feel free to.  

With that out of the way, Let’s talk about oil.  If you go look at [WTI futures today](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/future/crude%20oil%20-%20electronic), you’ll see something peculiar.  A barrel of WTI crude today sells for a hair under $24, and has dropped almost a dollar in today’s trading session (at the time I’m writing this).  A barrel of oil in August sells for $30.  Oil only a few months in the future is worth 25% more money.  This is called contango, when future contracts are worth more than present contracts.  In short, this is because nobody wants oil right now, and you can’t just shut off the pumps.  Saudi Arabia and the Coronavirus have, in tandem, skyrocketed current supply and destroyed current demand.  

So, how can one profit off of this?  To figure that out, we first need to learn how a company like Vitol can profit off this.  Vitol can buy May ~~contracts~~ physical crude at $24 and sell August contracts at $30.  Boom, 25% profit in three months, *risk free.*  All they have to do is store it; but how?  The answer is very large crude carriers (VLCCs).  Giant floating oil cans, usually used to transport oil over the open ocean.  Vitol can rent a VLCC from may to august, load it up with 2 MMbbl ($48 MM) of may WTI crude in the Gulf of Mexico, anchor it, then deliver on those $60 MM of august contracts in the same damn place.  

The only problem is every investment firm and their mother is going to be bidding for those VLCC contracts.  Risk free 25% returns in three months when interest rates are effectively 0% would be a free lunch, and there is no such thing.  I can’t speculate what the actual split would be, but If I could get even a risk free 3-4% return in three months I’d be over the fucking moon.  This means just about every cent of that $12 million dollar profit will become revenue for these tanker companies, which you can buy *right now.*  

Let’s switch gears and do some rough math on tanker companies.  [A 5 year old VLCC is currently worth about 75 million.]  (https://www.ssyonline.com/free-charts/5-year-old-secondhand-ship-values/#)  The average life expectancy of a VLCC is 20 years and Euronav amortizes their tankers at 5% of their upfront cost per year, so a 10 year old VLCC could be worth $50 MM, 15 year $25 MM etc.  With the oil contango as it sits now, A vlcc could expect 48 million in revenue over the next 12 months.  That’s ~$130,000 a day.  This means that the average 10 year old VLCC could expect to do 100% of its NAV in revenue over the next 12 months, and it’s pretty cheap to just park a ship at anchor. That’s a wicked return. [It was only ♫ the 26th night of September ♫ that VLCC TCEs were predicted to rise to $56,000 a day in 2020 by Argus](https://www.argusmedia.com/en/news/1985017-tanker-rates-to-rise-postimo-2020-panel)  But wait, there’s more!  Many of the tanker companies are trading *below NAV*.  $INSW is trading at .55 p/b.  $STNG is trading at .49 p/b.    And, if you want to really kick that risk/reward up a notch, $TNP is trading at .17 p/b.  If you want less risk/reward, companies like DHT, EURN, and FRO are trading at NAV right now.  Less leverage, more competent management, but less DWT (deadweight tonnage, i.e. tanker storage) per dollar of market cap.

Anyways, let's do some back of the napkin revenue calculations:  [DHT has 23 VLCCs in the spot market.](https://www.dhtankers.com/vessels/)  The company’s worth ~$1 B, and did $375 MM in revenue last year with a net income of $16 MM.  Let’s say, conservatively, they make $9MM/quarter-spot VLCC.  That’s $828 MM FY2020.  Given roughly the same operating expenses, that's a potential profit of $469 MM, or 2:1 EPS.  That’s 30x their FY2019 earnings.  This is assuming the oil contango doesn’t get any steeper, which it very well might as countries finish topping up their strategic reserves and the oil has nowhere to go.  [Even today, future oil prices are rising while spot oil is falling.](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/future/crude%20oil%20-%20electronic)

 And what happens when all our VLCCs are tied up in storage contracts and the world tries to end the quarantine and open up for business?  Transport rates *skyrocket.*  Not just the VLCCs, but the VLCCwomen and VLCChildren too.  I.E.  every suezmax, panamax, and afromax in the world's fleets will be worth their DWT in gold.  Oil demand and oil transportation are (roughly) equally inelastic.  It’s reasonable to expect charter rates to stay at the moon for at least 6 more quarters, and that could give tanker companies enough cashflow to buy back just about every floating share at current prices.  No pun intended.  But wait, there’s more!  If you haven’t been following, every oil and gas company under the sun has cut their capex.  What happens when no one’s drilling and no new wells are opening at the end of the world’s quarantine?  Oil prices soar and contango stays until new production can be guaranteed.  It takes years from order to delivery of an oil tanker, and years to ramp up oil production.  Hundreds of thousands a day for a VLCC could be the norm for years to come.  It looks like Tanker companies are on track to add a few zeros to their quarterly EPS for months if not years.

Alright, greedy speculation over.  I’m personally long $FRO, $EURN, $INSW, $DHT, and $STNG.  To restate, I’m not a financial analyst, I’m an engineering student with pretty limited investing experience.  If you can poke holes in my arguments, please do.  This seems too good to be true but I really can’t find the downsides that warrant some of these companies trading at half NAV.  

Here’s where I got the idea.  Kupperman knows a lot more than I do and can probably explain it better in his blog:

# Fed Set to Launch Multitrillion Dollar Helicopter Credit Drop

Call it Helicopter Credit.

The Federal Reserve is poised to spray trillions of dollars into the U.S. economy once a massive [aid package](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-26/senate-passes-2-trillion-virus-rescue-plan-sends-bill-to-house)  to fight the coronavirus and its aftershocks is signed into law. These  actions are unprecedented, going beyond anything it did during the 2008  financial crisis in a sign of the extraordinary challenge facing the  nation.

“The Fed has effectively shifted from lender of last resort  for banks to a commercial banker of last resort for the broader  economy,” said JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. chief U.S. economist Michael  Feroli.

The coming rain of credit -- historic in both size and scope -- will be made possible by [$454 billion](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-25/fed-s-anti-virus-lending-firepower-could-reach-4-5-trillion)  set aside in the aid package for Treasury to backstop lending by the  Fed. That’s money the central bank can leverage to provide massive  amounts of financing to a broad swathe of U.S. borrowers.

“Effectively one dollar of loss absorption of backstop from Treasury is enough to support $10 worth of loans.” Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said in in a rare nationally-televised [interview](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-26/powell-says-fed-will-keep-credit-flowing-as-virus-hits-economy) early Thursday morning. “When it comes to this lending we’re not going to run out of ammunition.”

&amp;#x200B;

He told NBC’s “Today” show that the Fed was trying to create a bridge  over what may well be a substantial decline in the economy in the  second quarter, to a resumption of growth sometime in the latter half of  the year.

“It’s very hard to say precisely when that will be,” he said.  “It will really depend on the spread of the virus. The virus is going  to dictate the timetable here.”

While the Fed can help by keeping  interest rates low and ensuring the flow of credit, “the immediate  relief” for Americans will come from the Congressional aid package,  Powell said. The bill [includes](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-26/senate-passes-2-trillion-virus-rescue-plan-sends-bill-to-house) direct payments to lower- and middle-income Americans of $1,200 for each adult and $500 for each child.

Combined with an unlimited quantitative easing program, the  Fed’s souped-up lending facilities are set to push the central bank’s  balance sheet up sharply from an already record high $4.7 trillion, with some analyst saying it could peak at $9-to-$10 trillion.

### Beef Up

The bill passed the Senate late on Wednesday and is now being considered by the House.

The  first order of business for the Fed -- once it has been signed into law  by President Donald Trump -- will probably be to beef up some of the  emergency lending facilities it’s already rolled out, particularly the  ones for corporations which were limited by the amount of money that was  available from Treasury prior to the aid package.

The central back is then expected to establish its so-called Main Street Business Lending Program to provide help to smaller firms.

“Very quickly we hope to stand up a very broad based lending facility that could be leveraged up to $2 or $3 trillion,”  Senator Pat Toomey told reporters Wednesday. “We’re hoping it’s a  mechanism to keep businesses alive for a few weeks or months until our  economy can resume.”

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is also pushing Powell and the Fed  to do more for hard-pressed state governments on the front lines of the  fight against the virus.

### Bite the ‘Wormy Apple’

“I’m  telling him to think big and help our states because they are taking a  big bite of this wormy apple and they need much more in terms of  resources,” the California Democrat told the PBS NewsHour television  program on Wednesday.

In his “Today” show interview on Thursday, Powell said the  Fed was “already helping state and local governments” -- an apparent  reference to the inclusion of some municipal debt in the central bank’s  commercial paper and money market financing facilities.

It was the  late economist Milton Friedman who floated the idea of a helicopter  drop of money into an economy fighting a severe recession. Former Fed  Chairman Ben Bernanke later described that approach more prosaically as a  broad-based tax cut financed by the central bank.

This is  different. Rather than the Fed financing the federal government,  Congress is providing money to absorb any losses the central bank may  incur on its emergency loans -- some of which will be going to riskier  borrowers.

And unlike helicopter money, the ramped up lending is  aimed not at stimulating the economy but rather at preventing a credit  crunch that could make the recession worse.

“This is helicopter  credit,” said Wrightson ICAP chief economist Lou Crandall. “They’re  still in the fireman role rather than the stimulus role.”",finance

personalfinance,"Parents haven't been filing taxes since 2011 (missing MASS state tax refunds due to the ""Circuit Breaker Credit"")","Today I was speaking with my parents and urging them to file taxes ASAP because that was one of the criteria for the upcoming stimulus checks. To my surprise they responded they hadn't done taxes since they retired in 2012 because their SSA-1099 said their was no tax withheld. I though, OK, no big deal but encouraged them to do their 2019 taxes even if it was a $0 refund. That was indeed the case for their federal taxes, but to my surprise they were due to get a refund of $436 in Massachusetts taxes. It just dawned on me that this is probably something they have been missing out on for the past 9 years.  


As far as I'm aware, federal taxes can be filed for as long as 10 years but refunds are only given for the 3 previous years. So, I have a few questions on the whole process:  
(1) Does Massachusetts follow the same process as the IRS and allowing individual to file for the 3 previous years for refunds or could it be that they are more generous with that?  
(2) Would the 3 previous years mean 2019, 2018, 2017 or would that include 2016?  
(3) Aside from that, what would be the cheapest software that I could buy (or get for free) that could help me fill their back their previous years' taxes to claim these refunds?

personalfinance,Supposed to close first week of May. Will lose $10k in earnest money if we back out. Still considering backing out.,"This is a throwaway account, obviously. And this is more of a vent, then a look for predictions.   You can't really get too many good answers in r/RealEstate due to it having so many vested professionals.  I like the house, and the neighborhood, but there are other neighborhoods we *love* that, well, I'd ride out renting for a year if area prices dropped by 20% or more.  My job is based in tech, so no idea really one way or the other about security. Employer so far has been really good compared to others I see out there, but its a large corp that often lays folks off randomly in good times (""work force reductions"") while still paying out large bonuses. I could make it a year on no income if I'm laid off.

Money we have came from selling prior residence, so I won't actually 'feel' the loss of $10k, but boy if you took $10k out of my checking account, I would sure feel it.  And man, walking away from spending ten thousand dollars with nothing to show for it sure sounds incredibly irresponsible.  We're not rich. Plus, I did get a low interest rate, and who knows what happens there.

However, if the markets are going to crash (and how can they not?), perhaps losing $10k now  in order to get something ""even better"" (or even comparable to what I'm buying now, but say for $100k less) is just a price to pay? Our agent, of course, is convinced the market will only dip slightly and everything will be hunky dory.  But he even downplays the virus itself (sadly, so do a lot of folks in the area), so I can't totally trust him.  

Plus, the area I live in has a high percentage of VRBO type rentals, which surely will take a hit.  High tourist area. From a ""personal finance"" point of view, I would guess I would have to factor in the rent money per month for a year plus the $10k we lose if we back out?  That would add up to nearly $35k I guess that we'd have to 'make up?'  

Leads me back to going forward, but boy sure is scary.  And pretty sure I'll kick myself if I see incredibly low values a year from now.

Thanks for letting me vent, and any thoughts are welcome.",finance
personalfinance,Should i be paying off debts completely? or just the minimums for now?,"Hello,

First i want to say i am very grateful and fortunate that during this crisis I still have a job and even some savings, there are lots of people that are in much worse off positions and this is a very scary time.

I normally do not have any debt besides student loans, but in December there was an emergency fix for my house and it blew thru my savings and so I had to take out a personal loan and credit card debt. 

I've already payed off half the personal loan and there is still $7k left on it, and about $12k between 2 credit cards.

I've been aggressively paying off the personal loan because it is a 20% interest rate.

The credit cards are at 16% and 14%. 

I have about $12k with me in my savings (just received my bonus and am getting my tax refund in).

My plan was to pay off the personal loan completely and then pay some of the credit card off, but I am wondering if right now I should hold onto the cash and just pay the minimums on the debt in case of something happening like getting layed-off (as far as i can tell there have been no signs indicating this but who knows).

My highest monthly expenses are:

-$2050 mortgage (was paying an extra $200 month on this, should i keep doing that?)

-$350 student loan (was paying an extra $100 month on this, all rates between 3.5%-6%) 

-$150 car insurance

-$200-300 month on food (i pay for parents and siblings as well)

Besides this the rest of my expenses are the minimums on the debt

-$150 on each card

-$415 on the personal loan

I make enough to pay the above but im just worried that if I pay some of the debts off and lose the cash on hand and there is layoffs that ill be f'ed.

The credit cards are accumulating about $60-70 a month of interest each and the personal loan about $150 a month

investing,"Re-investing strategy to ""recover losses quicker"", too good to be true?","Hello guys and girls

I have this re-investing strategy idea, which kinda sounds too good to be true, so I want to share it for a more diverse scrutiny.

I started investing at the beginning of this year, and my portfolio value got smashed. The total investment value was over $100k, but now it's down about 40%, to about $80k.

Initially I just wanted to invest long-term, to ""make my money work for me"". However, during the first few weeks I noticed that the profit of some stocks going up was way too good to leave it untouched (sometimes way over the value of the quarterly dividend), so I kept selling to lock profits, and re-purchasing afterwards (at a higher price; basically scalping, but with a long-term perspective). I kind of transformed myself from an investor into a trader, with some days having over 50 transactions, sometimes for only a few dollars profit each. But it added up, I was about $5k in profit over my initial deposit just 6 weeks in. However, with the market crashing, prices going down meant there wasn't anything left to scalp (I am talking about long positions -- I am not interested in shorting as I have lost way too much money, sometimes barely hitting the ""stop loss"" limit only to see stocks going south a lot afterwards -- unlike scalping longs, CFD shorts brought a lot of anxiety in my daily life (beside $xx,xxx losses) and I am not interested in getting more of that :) ) 

Back to my strategy. Today for example, I had about $9000 to ""play"" with and I managed to ""scalp"" about $200 profit (an average of $5-$10 per trade). I am thinking I would do much better if I sold everything and ""played"" with a lot more cash, to basically recover the value of the shares through the volatility of the market. I am doing this while assuming the market is close to (or already hit) the bottom (in Europe it's much worse than in the US, with some stock down even 70+%). Unlike the crash, volatility of the stock on the way up would work a lot in my favor, because I would constantly buy each dip and sell every profit I can take. Then re-buy the lowest valued stock, sell for profit, rinse and repeat. It's not uncommon to see 10% rises one day, followed by a 10% drop the next in many European stocks. This also applies to the US market, but I think that one might not have hit the bottom yet, given the relaxed attitude towards the increasing number of infections there. There is a good chance that America gets F-ed into oblivion, with the way Trump is handling things (just a personal opinion).

So, my question would be, instead of waiting for stock to go up to previous values (which might take years), should I just sell and scalp my way back up with a lot of smaller transactions? With a big investment, I can probably recover a 40% loss in less than 6 months, if the market is volatile enough. I don't mind doing it, as I have plenty of time and it keeps my boredom away, so this would not be a problem. I have to mention that, aside from the buy/sell price spread, I am not paying transaction fees with my current broker (etoro).

So, where is the flaw in my strategy?

Thank  you",finance
personalfinance,Transunion won't help me dispute a debt or even tell me why they think it's legitimate - am I experiencing the real world?,"I have a debt collector coming after me for an apartment debt in the name of an ex of mine.

investing,What the stimulus can actually do to the economy,"The stimulus is roughly the size of 5 weeks of GDP. The efficacy, however, is limited. A few reasons:

1. It doesn't restore investment and consumer confidence to pre virus levels. Most of it will be used to barely get by or as precautionary savings
2. It is not as timely an efficiently assigned as actual market activity (the real economy generating profits, rent and wages by the day)
3. The loans also aren't necessarily efficiently assigned or spent. They're handing money based on need but how it's used and received won't be as economically efficient as regular bugdet decision making. This risks the creation of financial bubbles and acquisition of junk credit
4. Crowding out: the stimulus will be financed with bonds. Those bonds need to be purchased at the expense of investing (probably not such a big deal in these times with low investment confidence though)
5. You can't legislative or QE the creation of actual wealth. Only real and demanded output is wealth. You can alleviate the need for liquidity thanks to our fiat money system, but it isn't actual wealth. In the best case, it's wealth borrowed from the future, and in the worst, it's just inflation (financial bubble)

The conclusion: it cushions the fall and probably avoids the long term destruction of value (some jobs and businesses), but ultimately you can't get something for nothing (back to point 5), otherwise the FED would always keep unlimited QE and government would pay for everything. In terms of markets, I expect more bull traps on the way to the bottom before the recovery, and perhaps a less horrible bottom.",finance
personalfinance,Student loans buyout from parents. Advisable?,"To start, I'm posting on my secondary account instead of my main, to keep my identity a secret because I'm ashamed of how much debt I have. I need advice as quickly as possible because I might be forced to decide by tomorrow.   
I am 21 years old, and I'm a first year law student in Northeast, US. I took out private loans to get through undergrad, in the amount of $86,000. Since then, about $12,000 in interest has accrued, for a total of nearly $100,000. 

In order to attend and finish law school, I will likely need an additional $100,000 in loans. These are federal loans.   
All in, I'll have about $200,000 in debt when I graduate. As daunting as this is, my parents have generously offered to pay my private loan up front, 50k from each, and then allow me to pay them back over time, as I can.   
The problem is that I'm worried how this will affect my plan to pay off my federal loans using Income Based Repayment because I don't foresee a high-paying job (at least in my immediate future).  
When they calculate IBR, they look at your discretionary income and make sure your payment is less than 10% of your discretionary income. Since I will no longer ""officially"" have 100k in private loans, I'm worried my income will appear to be much higher than it really is. For instance, if I make 48k, or $4,000 per month, it's likely my Income Based Repayment will be $400 or less (if I'm lucky). However, I'll also be tasked with making payments on my private loan (hopefully $2,000 per month at that salary). If I keep the private loan, that will be subtracted from my discretionary income and my IBR will be much lower. So I'm unsure what to do.   


Does anyone have any advice or thoughts on this?   
Thanks in advance.

Also does anyone have any idea about what my quality of life will be? I've read some daunting horror stories about student debt and might take my own life if this becomes too much.

personalfinance,"Refinancing my VA loan to cash out, bad timing?","About us: Both my wife and I have extremely stable incomes and I have over $1mil in guaranteed life insurance through several different companies. Either my wife and I can pay our mortgage and basic living expenses on one income. 

We're in a desirable area (MN) and have a fantastic neighborhood and great 4br 2ba house on a .25 acre lot. Home inventory has dropped significantly in the past month, no doubt because of COVID 19. 

Two weeks ago when interest rates were diving, I started the process of refinancing my home loan. We're 4 years into a 30 year and we've seen a nice uptick in our property value, but had some emergent expenses in the past year and a half that have me carrying a debt of about $17k on a 6% APR interest rate. 

Our cash-out will eliminate my personal debt and possibly eliminate my car payment too ($9.5k balance, 2.9%). 

We're in a 3.5% APR 30yr loan now, locked in to a 30yr 2.75% paying 1/4 point with the refi. The only significant setback will be the VA funding fee. I'm not registering for Disability until I retire from the military in less than 4 years. So I'm going to have to bite the bullet on the 3.6% funding fee.

I'm wondering if it might be a good idea to call off the refi.

Is it likely that I'm setting myself up for failure here? Our home value has been steadily climbing, but I'm worried that if/when the depression hits we might find ourselves upside down in our loan because of value. 

Though the refi-cash out option only let's us borrow up to 90%LTV, I'm still concerned that with dark times upon us, I could see a reduction in home value greater than 10% of our mandated remaining equity. 

All in all, I see clearing the debts as a great way to clear the books and start saving (beyond 401k) for rainy days. We could take the hundreds of dollars of payments and interest and sock it away in savings.

personalfinance,"[MI] First time buying, fiance and I are looking for advice on securing a mortgage loan on a singlewide in our area.","With everything going on, I know this is a crazy time to be considering buying a house but this is just where we're at in our lives. I could use some advice on how to handle the whole process, from getting a loan to closing the deal. 

&amp;#x200B;

My fiance and I are in our late 20's, with a baby girl on the way. We are currently staying at my Grandparents place until they get back from Florida in June, and they're not charging us rent. Staying past June is not a good option for anyone though, the house is too small and I'm due in July. Otherwise, we'd stay and save more money to buy the trailer we're interested outright. We've saved enough so far to get an apartment if all else fails, but we're really looking at getting a trailer just so we know we can stay in one place for at least a few years and not have to move again. 

&amp;#x200B;

The loan we applied for is for 20K, with a 2K down payment. The next step is speaking with someone from the bank to discuss interest rates and the length of the loan, ect... What range should we be expecting as far as interest rates? 

&amp;#x200B;

If/when we agree on the loan rates and are pre-approved, is it worth getting a realtor? The two trailers we're interested in are listed at 15K and 17K, and newly renovated. With or without a realtor, we'll be having an inspection done of course if they accept our offer. How realistic would it be to get the price down, even if we don't anticipate finding anything substantial during the inspection?  One has been listed for months through the trailer park community office, the other is an individual owner listing and was listed last week. 

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, how long can we realistically expect this process to take? As I mentioned, we have the next two months to lock something down. Both homes are empty so at least we're not going to be stuck waiting on the family to move out if we finalize a purchase. With how things are right now, I can expect it to take longer than usual, but hopefully since it's a trailer the owners want to sell quickly and move on?

There were a handful of negative reactions, and after probing it turns out they either sold their bags long ago in a correction, or sold at what they thought was the top. A notable interaction I had with some customers was this pair of women who were young and looked/talked like the last sort of person you would imagine talking about BTC. When they opened up on it? Wow. They basically had the kind of mini debate on the topic that was extremely insightful on the base level. The kind of back and forth you would find even on here when relating to the future of bitcoin as money. I was really impressed hearing it, because it gave me hope that the every day person has the capacity to embrace it.

- ATM's are scam central.

Someone commented in that last post over how popular these ATM's are with scammers. I was naive in thinking it would be a once in a while ordeal. NOPE. 90% of all the traffic the ATM gets is people getting scammed. Over the last few months it's gotten really easy to spot who's getting worked and who isn't. Here's the crazy thing...THEY DON'T LISTEN. At all. I've tried every possible method. I've tried pleading with their sense of logic. I've tried accurately telling them HOW they're being scammed without them telling me details. I've tried being on the mean side to snap them out of it. In the last 3 months I have only managed to successfully thwart one attempt, and that was by literally pulling the plug on the ATM. It was crazy. There was this old man...had to be in his 70's...on speaker phone with the scammer that was telling him what to do. It was so obviously a scam that I was pleading with this guy not to do it. He ignored me completely as he followed the instructions on the other line. Before he got the chance to put money in I unplugged the machine and told him to pass me the phone. Immediately after hearing that the scammer hung up and I finally was able to talk some sense to the guy. That's it. The only victory I can claim. Every other person thoughtfully listened to me and proceeded to feed the machine anyways. What's worse is how they ALWAYS say they're gonna try it once just to see and they won't be back....and they ALWAYS come back. The most common victim is older men in their 40's-60's, all helping their out of country/state girlfriends that they have never met. Other notable scams are the put x amount in and get double back, pay x amount for the supplies you need for this new job you're starting, and the ever popular bail bondsmen/IRS payment to avoid arrest (that was the old old guy's scam). It's so frustrating that now, when a new one comes in, I'll tell them that if they don't listen to my advice, that i will not lift a finger to help them in any way. Doesn't matter....they just keep coming back in as the scammer slowly juices them.

-There is hope

While the majority are love sick men that throw their money away until they're broke/fed up, there are SOME people that get it. They don't put in much, but they put some in every chance they get. I even have 2 or 3 people that understand exactly what bitcoin is and put some serious money in. Interestingly enough, the majority of the ones that get it and are using the ATM how it's meant are women. I help these people in every way i can, making suggestions and giving tips where applicable. Also, the simple presence of the bitcoin has its own affect. People see that it's not just some thing they see sometimes on the news. It's in their face and out in the real world. It's sparked conversations with people that simply needed a tiny push to believe it's not going anywhere. I even got one lady to buy a full bitcoin (i can only hope she listened to my advice on holding strong, because it was before the major correction a few weeks back)


Conclusion-
These ATM's and how they're used show a clear sign that to the everyday public, we are nowhere near close to mass adoption. But they are getting used, and every day it's in my store, it shows the everyday public where the future is heading. Unfortunately I don't have those hard numbers for you because as of yesterday, my business was closed by the health dept due to COVID-19 (Smoke shops are not considered essential). Sure, I could go back into the store and get those numbers, but I got much bigger things on my plate to worry about. My landlord has chosen to stay silent and use the property manager as a buffer to give vague answers as to what I'm liable for. As of today still no word. So yeah...kinda mega screwed for who knows how long in how I'm going to pay my bills. That is, unless of course I want to sink myself in debt with some SBA loan that will take far too long to even hope getting approved for (I tried applying for one when i opened over 8 years ago and the process took months, only to be declined). Now that I am ripe with free time, I figured i would take some of it to finally give some of you the info I promised. Be safe out there and wish me luck in not going under.

I have been unemployed for the past 3 months with my licence suspended for the past month. I was relying on the states for unemployment benefits and food stamps while searching for a job, but my luck has run out and I need money.  So I decided to go for postmates. But here is where I need help. Iam overdrawn by $500 in my checking account. Technically I can only go up to 400, but bills and fees added it up. With that being said, What ever I make with postmates (im not expecting much tbh), I still wont be able to use the money until I made about $200. My situation is, I need gas as well as groceries. I wanted to have the money deposited to my cash card so I can use it right away, but after some research, it seems that wont work. People were recommending Chime. I only recently started hearing about them and sounded good. But too good to be true. So I decided to do researching, their subreddit is small and many people seem to dislike them, mainly because the deposit doesnt hit on time. Someone said they were going to Capital One, and they look nice, except for the overdraft options where none of the options sound nice to me. 

Currently with my credit union bank, Im charged $31 each time I make a purchase while overdrafted. Or if I had money in my savings, they will take it out of there. Neither do I like. With a bank I do want no minimum balance, no over draft fees, no monthly or annual fees, and a high interest rate savings. Not required but would be nice is, early deposit and a bank I can use with any atm with no fees.

personalfinance,Refinancing/Consolidate Student Loans,"A family member is considering refinancing/consolidating their student loans, so that they can have lower monthly payments (and hopefully lower interest rates).

They have several private loans, some of which are variable interest, and also several federal loans.

We've tried researching the best approaches toward paying their debt, and we understand the idea of paying off the highest-interest loans first, but we saw conflicting recommendations when it came to consolidation/refinancing...

* Some say to only refinance/consolidate the lowest variable interest rate loans
* Some say to refinance *all* variable rate loans
* Some say to refinance the highest interest loans, *regardless* if they're variable or fixed interest
* Some say to just try refinancing all private loans overall

This makes it confusing when trying to apply for consolidation/refinance loans, as they usually ask what your loan amounts are and your monthly payments. We're unsure if we should be putting the total for *all* loans (not just ones we wish to refinance), or specific ones, etc, nor are we sure which ones specifically to refinance for.

Is there any advice or clarification anyone here can offer?

Here's a breakdown of all their loans, grouped by the three providers they make their monthly payments to. Variable rate loans are italicized.

investing,Would it be a good time to invest in REITs?,"With the majority of REITs taking a big hit this month, I believe some types of REITs will be good for long-term investment. Here is my argument. Please tell me what you think.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Commercial REITs are still very risky due to businesses shutting down, and perhaps being unable to make payment. This may mean commercial REITs will have a worse earning season than other types.
2. Mortgage REITs are at less of a risk because of the FED's willingness to go essentially to minus interest in order to insure steady cashflow. I know it is harder for banks to earn profit when interest gets low due to decreasing interest spread, and I assume the same would apply to mREITs, but still the recent drop is more than enough to make up for the lower interest. On the flip side, I know rising interest rates is also a risk to REITS, but since we might be entering another period of long recession, I don't think we have to worry about a big hike in interest rate in the near future.
3. REITs in retirement sector will continue to do well due to boomers retiring.  REITs in renewable energy and other clean technology will continue to do well regardless of the drop in oil prices.
4. REITs in data storage sector will continue to do well, but has barely taken a hit. This means that with limited cash, investments in REITs in other sectors will yield higher returns at least in the short term.
5. One concern that I do have is if a particular REIT has high-yield bonds and other risky low-grade bonds that they will have to take a loss on if the pandemic gets worse. The FED will not be able to save all.",finance

Or Years to recover),"So the biggest movers over the last 2 weeks are mortgage REITs (MFA, IVR, RWT.  $15 DOLLAR STOCKS THAT ARE TRADING AT 3 TO 6 DOLLARS which rebounded from pennies) I have a basic understanding of how REITs work. Companies that leverage short term loans to invest in real estate mortgage bonds. The downward spiral is driven by, I quote: ""The banks have been far less accommodating on non-agency MBS positions. By pushing investors to sell, then drive down the price. When the price falls, they want more collateral.""  And Access to additional cash is hard/uncertain even with blank checks from the Fed. 

But all this supposedly runs counter to historal norms. REITs are considered safe investments in market down turns. Because the nature of underlying real estate asset and rent as safe form of income. 

So my questions are:

1. Why are there margin calls on existing REITs loans?  I haven't heard that the NY real estate market have crashed? Is it concern over rent collection due to lack of economic actitivty? What's the driving factor?  Devalued assets or reduced income. Are there data backing either claims?


2. How long would it take for REITs to bounce back?  REITs are popular with the fixed income crow(Boomers and retirees). By handing over mortgage as collateral to secure cash loans would means more interest payment down the road and less return ( but 0 APR from the Fed should help) . But what's the time frame?

Best case scenario, it passes and 90% of American families will get a check from uncle Sam for about $1200 or $2400 if you're married. But what's going happen from there?

The markets been doing amazing the pass week just based on this news alone and it didn't even happen yet.
Lets say the bill get pass Monday 3/30 and the IRS starts working on it the same day. Now idk about you, but it took at least 3 weeks for them to direct deposit my refunds this year and I did it early. Now imagine if they have to process over 100 million checks( about less than 1/3 of the us, using conservative numbers right now) at the same time. It's going to take longer than 3 weeks for people to get their checks and that is with direct deposit too. So the time is going to be even slower with people who received their refunds by mail. This puts us at a time frame of April 17 the earliest of receiving the check. This could be different for corporations and small business. 

Now lets be honest, even with access to this money, the majority of the people will not be able to spend it. The virus is going to get worst before it gets better.

It's only a matter of time before the rest of the country catches up the NY, Ca, or Wa. I hope I'm wrong, I really do. 

That is why I think that what we are seeing right now is just a short term rise in the market. People are excited that they're getting free money, but that doesn't change that fact that no one is going on a cruise anytime soon. planes aren't going to be magically filled with passenger anytime soon.

However, the box 5 amount was smaller than the box 1 amount by a lot. That means all of the scholarships that my school gave me go directly towards tuition, and I still pay the rest with my own money  every semester.

I just started a new well-paying job last week after leaving my previous job at the end of last year, and my current question is a good problem to have, especially compared to what others are going through.

Background: I have a significant amount of student loan debt (all federal) from going to business school. I also have an outstanding car loan (2.9%). My wife and I have a sizable emergency fund saved up and no accumulated credit card debt. I am only eligible for my new job's 401(k) after 6 months. Because I was not working the first few months of the year and a significant chunk of my new job's compensation is variable we will be under the Roth IRA income limits this year but probably not next year. 

My question then is this: what should I do for the next 6 months while student loan payments are deferred and I'm not eligible for my company's 401(k)? Should I throw everything I would have been putting into the 401(k), adjusted for taxes, at the student loans so the principal is lower once interest kicks back in? Should I put the money toward a Roth IRA since I'll be under the income limits and the market is likely to make a decent recovery?

investing,Maybe a naive idea,"Here is my interpretation of the recent financial events:

Helicopter money from thin air will go to people and businesses. This is somewhat similar to WW2 gov spending that led to the so-called prosperity during war.

Except that this time the war happens on US soil, too, and more money won't stir up production and output, but merely keeping the economy on floating level while driving the value of the dollar down. 

The only way magic money can be an actual stimulus with a net positive output is if businesses participates in the effort against corona by building hospitals, equipment, ambulances, people get hired in the health system etc.
But this isn't happening, most will people be staying home and not having any activity.

This isn't a stimulus, it's an adrenaline shot to an economy that is lying on the ground faint.

What the gov and FED could do instead (or along with) printing money would be to issue a ""Corona bond"" to protect the economy from a bubbling inflation in the next period and giving everyone a chance to participate in the economic effort.

Tomorrow starts an order for all non essential businesses to close here in Central Florida. On a global scale, this has been or will be the case everywhere. No matter what the fed does, our consumer spending has been and will be abysmal over these next few months. 

Now if a business doesnt make any money, they aren't worth anything. Simple as that. And with no money being put into these companies, quarterly reports are going to majorly miss their targets which could send wall street into a panic.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

personalfinance,Why the Fed setting the Reserve Rate to 0% doesn't matter for you.,"Good morning /r/personalfinance,

After screaming into the wind over in /r/news, I thought I'd come explain to you why the Reserve Requirement Ratio being set to 0% doesn't matter for you.  There seem to be some significant misunderstandings about what it means, what the Reserve Requirement does, and how it affects consumers.  

First, the Reserve Requirement is the amount of cash (or cash equivalents) banks must maintain on deposit at the Fed.  This money is used to settle interbank transactions and to encourage banks to maintain a certain level of **liquidity**.  

Second, if a bank's reserve account is below the limit set by the Fed, they simply borrow from other banks, overnight, at the Fed Funds rate.   Banks with excess reserves will lend money to other banks with insufficient reserves at the Fed Funds Rate.  On balance sheets, these are recorded as Fed Funds Purchased and Fed Funds Sold.   When the Fed Funds Rate is 0% (like it is now), banks can effectively borrow from each other for free (realistically, almost free, since they'll still pay a few basis points).  If the banks can't  borrow from other banks (due to credit concerns, for instance), the bank can borrow directly from the Federal Reserve at the Discount Window (which currently has a rate of 0.25% for primary credit and 0.75% for secondary credit) to maintain adequate reserves.  Setting the reserve requirement to zero, simply means bank's won't need to borrow from the fed or from each other at a very nominal rate.  It essentially eliminates a small expense for banks while greatly reducing accounting transactions and interbank liabilities.  

So, what does this mean for the average depositor?  

**Nothing**. 

Just because banks don't need to keep liquidity at the Fed, doesn't mean they *won't*.  They just don't need to incur an expense if their liquidity levels dip below the prior rate of 10%.  Banks are also required to maintain Contingency Funding Plans (Funding and Liquidity Risk Management -Interagency Guidance) that creates a framework to ensure they maintain sufficient liquidity levels in times of stress and have sufficient contingent liquidity sources to meet their needs in those specific times of stress.  

Additionally, large banks are subject to the Liquidity Coverage Ratio, which is a requirement of Basel 3 (which are basically international banking accords).  This requires Large Banks to maintain sufficient liquid assets to cover 1 month of out going cash flows.  

&gt;Will this cause my bank to fail?

Unlikely at this point.  Compared to the 2008 crisis, banks are better capitalized, have better liquidity risk management processes (including the above mentioned contingency funding plans), and hold higher levels of liquidity.  Banks are in a better position to defer borrowers, allowing them to recover before they become past due.  

&gt;Does this mean bank's can lend an unlimited amount of money?


No, *No*, **No,** A thousand times no.   This is the biggest misconception I've see (and honestly, the entire reason for my post).  A reserve ratio of 0% does not mean banks can lend an unlimited amount of money.  It means they can lend 10% more money (at most).  Think of the reserve requirement as the minimum you need to maintain in your checking account before you start incurring maintenance fees.  The Fed has simply waived that balance requirement and is waiving all the fees for everyone.  

&gt;But what about Fractional Reserve Banking?  Doesn't that mean bank's can lend out money they don't have?

No.   Per accounting rules, banks can't lend out money they don't have. For every dollar of assets (loans, investments, cash, etc), they need to have $1 in liabilities (deposits or loans)) or capital equity (surplus, retained earnings, etc).  

IF a bank has $100 in liabilities/capital, the bank must have $100 in assets.  If a bank has $200 in liabilities/capital, they must have $200 in assets.  There's a reason we call the balance sheet a balance sheet.  Because it needs to **balance**.  

Further, banks are constrained by their Capital ratio (Assets divided by capital).  This is part of Basel II, Basel III, 12 CFR 3, 12 CFR 6, and various parts of interagency guidance.  Leverage ratios are around 9% for Large bank holding companies, and 10% for other bank holding companies (https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/2018-november-financial-stability-report-leverage.htm).  This means banks are leveraged about 10 to 1.  This is much different than the financial crisis when it was closer to 20-1.  (5%).  And certainly much higher than Lehman Brothers, which had a leverge ratio of 31-1 (or 3.2%). 


I hope this effectively explains why the reserve requirement going to zero doesn't matter for you.

personalfinance,Is negative equity on a car loan EVER worth it?,"**See bottom for updates on the situation**
EDIT: I realized how confusing it was for everyone that I listed all prices in Canadian currency. I went through my post and edited all of them to USD. If you see people talking about a $69k loan, that’s referring to $49k USD, as now written below.

Hey! My fiancé and I purchased a 2019 Kia Sorento in May 2019 from a Kia dealership. It was our first car purchase. We did end up having some buyer’s remorse for the following reasons (I’m Canadian but I converted all prices to USD):

1. $231 biweekly, 84-month financing at 7.99% - High interest rate, long term loan made me nervous and payments were a wee bit above budget (by a wee bit, I mean more like a lot). 

Originally, we wanted to get a cheaper used car (budget: &amp;lt;$20,000) but the $8,000 cash-back offered by the dealer was a pretty attractive option at the time. That cash back was only available on the purchase of a brand new, more expensive car. The Sorento was valued at ~27k. We paid off most of our credit card debt with that cash back.

So I was making breakfast two days ago when I got a random phone call. I answered, and it was the Kia dealership that sold us our car 10 months prior. They were letting us know about low interest rate promotions they have going on. “You could qualify for a 0.99% interest rate if you’re interested in trading-in your car!” I was skeptical but kept an open mind. Going from 7.99% to 0.99% is a big jump worth looking into, in my opinion. I let them check our eligibility for this rate and yes, we were eligible. They asked if we wanted to come in to know more and check out some models so we decided to go in the next day. 

Fast-forward to yesterday afternoon, we test drove a 2020 Kia Sportage SX Turbo. Going in, I was hoping that if we did decide to trade in our Sorento, it would be for a car cheap enough to keep our biweekly payments roughly the same. I didn’t feel great about looking into a trade in so early on in our financing due to the negative equity from the car we barely paid for. 

The dealership offered us only $17.5k for the Sorento. My question to them was: is rolling over that much money into a new loan really worth the crazy low interest rate? Their answer was yes, but I was still skeptical. They convinced me when they said that we’d be paying down our principal much faster than with that 7.99% rate. More money goes to the car, less to the bank.

I did not think we would be walking out of that dealership 3 hours later having signed a bill of sale and loan paperwork for that Sportage, but we sure did. 

My regrets: 

1. I rushed the decision. I told myself I wouldn’t but we were getting close to them closing for the day and I wouldn’t have had time to come back for a little while. What if the deal was gone after a few days? I let them pressure me into making a choice right then and there, I should have slept on it.

2. We are now binded to a loan of 49k over 84 months, $280 biweekly at 1.85% (apparently the bank could only offer 0.99% for loans less than 15k... 1.85% is still better than 7.99% though.... right?). That’s an extra $93 a month out of our pockets and we have reset to 84 months of payments ahead of us. Negative equity rolled over was ~13k. 

3. I think we should have waited at least 2-3 years before considering this, to reduce the negative equity rolled over. But how much interest money were we throwing away with that 8% rate?? 

I need some perspective. Are we complete idiots or was there some sense in rolling over that much negative equity to slash our interest rate? Be as harsh as you need to be, I really need some guidance. We’re feeling SO stupid right now but are we overreacting?

For your info, we haven’t even driven this car off the lot yet, that’s happening in 6 hours.

EDIT: If anyone has advice on talking to the dealership about backing out, I could use that too. I know that legally I don’t have a leg to stand on, but I’m hoping to make something work.

UPDATE (super detailed, for anyone interested): 
So we spent roughly four hours at the dealership today. We went in there and first read through all the paperwork with the hopes of finding a significant error. The only thing that was weird was that in the loan paperwork, under our expenses, the amount I pay for my apartment rental was written as $1 (I had inquired about that before signing, she said that it doesn’t really matter). The actual rent payment was put under my fiancé’s name, who was put down as the co-buyer in this thing.

The sales manager came in and listened to what I had to say. He asked me what I want, and I said that we’d like to cancel the contract if at all possible. He said that he’s willing to go ask his boss. A few minutes later, he came back telling us that he didn’t notice that the loan had « already been processed by the bank » and that there’s nothing they can do on their end. We told him we’ll give the bank a call then. By this point, we expected some serious bluffing. While on hold with the bank, we told him that we don’t feel good about the slight increase of interest rate exposed to us right before signing. He replied by offering a $1400 USD rebate (not part of loan but I’d have to make sure of that). He also added on free oil changes for life. We thanked him but expressed we’d still like to cancel.

We were on hold for almost two hours but finally got to a CSR. We explained our situation, gave our names and phone numbers  and he attempted to pull up the loan information. He found absolutely nothing and told us that a loan like this wouldn’t be processed in less than a day. We went back into the dealership to tell them that. The sales manager showed us an ‘official document’ from the bank itself showing details of the loan. That’s when the GM came into the picture. He said that CSR’s normally wouldn’t have access to that kind of info so soon so that’s why the guy missed it. He was pretty stern, telling us that they’re within their rights to refuse any sort of unwinding of contract (which we acknowledged as well) but that he’s willing to sympathize with us. He explained why it’s not as simple as just ripping up the contract and going about our separate ways. Here’s his points:

1. « The way that registering a sold car works, we can’t register one and cancel that registration without the car’s status permanently changed to Used. The low interest rate that we offered you, we got from paying the bank that difference in interest (from a typical rate like 5-6%) out of our own pockets. If the car comes back to us as Used, we can’t offer that same low interest deal to others so we lose potential sales »

2. « You were already in a not so great situation with your Sorento. At an 8% interest rate, you’re spending over $10k in interest over 7 years. Why not put that same amount of money into paying down principal faster? 

So as you can see, more sales tactics at play. My questions at that point: first the only issue is the bank already procesded the loan, now it’s also that they can’t unregister the car without penalties. Obviously they’re trying to keep us locked in. I explained some more how I’m feeling about this sale. Their general manager offered that we pay them $5k to offset their losses from: undoing the registration, from prepping the car for possession, etc. We’d get the contract voided and get our old car back, which they now own. That was his final word.

Alternative? Keep the contract, but with added incentives: $1.4k check (difference between 1.85% and 0.99% interest rate), free oil changes for life and a $1000 CAD credit for servicing from them. 

I know that these incentives don’t measure up to our losses from going through with this loan so we don’t wanna go that route. 

We left the dealership telling them we need an extra day to think this through. We’re still using the car we test drove as a loaner car for the time being. Still haven’t driven the new car so hopefully it’s not over yet.

FINAL UPDATE: The contract is now VOID! We did end up paying for some servicing fees on the original car (cleaning, tire changes they had already done) but considering they cancelled the contract for us, that was more than fair!  We have 100% learned our lesson. Thank you all!",finance
personalfinance,Getting out of a difficult housing situation,"I’ve been wanting to post this for a long time and I’m finally doing it! Please forgive the length of the post.

I’m currently on the path to FIRE but there is a significant obstacle in the way. Some backstory: While I was living at home with my parents, they made me give them $500 a week that they were “putting away” for me for when I got married/bought a house. The balance reached $30,000 before I got married. We got married and the money wasn’t available (because the money was tied up in one of their houses that my sister and brother in law were living in but couldn’t get a mortgage on because he works under the table). When we went to buy a house 3 years later, they still didn’t have the money because my sister still hadn’t taken over the mortgage. That is problem #1. When we went to buy a house, we were in a rush, unfortunately. We were kicked out of our apartment because the town had purchased the property and the building was going to be demolished. We didn’t want another year lease and decided to start looking for a house. Our former landlord let us live in his basement apartment for a couple of months while we looked. We looked at many houses with our real estate agent and I think she became fed up with showing us so many houses. We looked at houses of all sizes but decided on a very small house, well below my means, to keep expenses down and hasten our journey to FIRE. We found one in the town I grew up in Connecticut and it was listed for $220k, a short sale.  It was on a nice, quiet street within walking distance of the elementary, middle and high schools. There were already 8 bids on the house and our RE agent made us put in a $255k bid, saying we wouldn’t get it if we didn’t (which I think was exorbitant, and I feel that the other bids were LOWER than $220k). The bid, of course, was accepted. I don’t know how, but the house comped on the bank assessment and we were given the mortgage at 3.375%. 

 Here start the problems: The house is a ranch and only 1050 square feet and only has one bathroom with a plastic corner shower (no bath). It has two bedrooms with very small closets and another room without a closet-so only two bedrooms. There is no upstairs living room or dining room, just a space when you walk in that is serving as our dining room in front of the fireplace and picture window. The basement, fortunately, is finished, and the family room is down there, but we need to use electric heaters down there. The furnace is low-efficiency, the cheapest the previous owner could put in. We found out the house was owned by a previously very rich family that lost everything. They didn’t care about the house, as they didn’t plan on staying there. The house was built in the late 1940s, block construction, with no insulation in the walls. It can get cold in the winter and hot in the summer due to lack of insulation and we can’t add insulation without reframing all the interior walls.  The previous owner was a hack and did a lot of work unprofessionally, causing me more work. The lawn and landscaping were horrible, many trees needed to be taken down, I needed to put in new gutters and fascia and spent countless hours removing ivy from the house.  The rear patio had to be replaced since the former owner built it up to the level of the rear door and water would come in the house. The front porch was rotting and I had to have masonry stairs put in. In short, I’ve probably spent over $20k in upgrades and repairs in the past 3 years we’ve owned the house.  What is worse, our neighbor’s house, which is much nicer just sold for $279k. An old lady lived there and kept it immaculate and well-maintained. It  is 1800 sq feet, has 5 bedrooms, 2.5 bathrooms, sunroom and a 2 car garage (we have one car garage). From what my RE agent tells me, we are in a seller’s market now. When I saw what it sold for, I was fumigating.

I just don’t know what to do. I feel we severely overpaid for the house, we have PMI because I was screwed by my parents on the $30k.  All of the reasons we bought a small house for (savings on utilities, taxes, maintenance, etc) seem to be completely irrelevant and we really aren’t saving much than we would’ve paid on a larger home.  I’m looking for advice. Should we get out of this home? Despite it’s shortcomings, the house is very cute and has curb appeal. It has stucco, which is atypical for our area. The neighborhood is very nice. The school system is top notch. We live very close to my parents and sister/brother in law so they can help with our baby at times. I don’t want to dump money and put an addition on it to bring it up to the houses around it. A local contractor wanted $85k just to increase the size of the master bedroom, add a bathroom and increase the size of the bonus room to add a closet to make it a bedroom. I know I’ll need to at least add a bath and redo the ONE bathroom it has.

My financial situation: I’m 31. I make $130k a year, my wife stays home with our infant daughter. I have $28k left in student loan debt currently at a 1.9% interest rate that will be paid off in less than two years. We have one paid off car (a cheap beater to get to work, which is less than 5 miles from my home), and a reliable car with one more year of payments on it. I’m maxing out my employer 401k  ($19k)and  Roth IRA and  have $20k in an emergency fund. Current investments in retirement funds were at $40k before the crash. I also have about $25k in my checking account ready to use for investing or real estate.

Sorry for the long-winded story. Any advice or suggestions would be appreciated. Again, my goal is to FIRE as soon as possible. I’m not sure if we should sell the home or stay in it. I’m not sure if I should start investing in real estate or dump more in the stock market. Thank you!",finance

**Recent Updates**

*(Note: These are the updates from the last 48-72 hours.)*

&amp;nbsp;

MARCH 30 - 

*General:*

* Coronavirus death rate is lower than previously reported, study says, but it's still deadlier than seasonal flu. The research, published in the medical journal The Lancet Infectious Diseases, estimated that about 0.66% of those infected with the virus will die. That coronavirus death rate, which is lower than earlier estimates, takes into account potentially milder cases that often go undiagnosed -- but it's still far higher than the 0.1% of people who are killed by the flu. When undetected infections aren't taken into account, the Lancet study found that the coronavirus death rate was 1.38%, which is more consistent with earlier reports.

*Updates from around the world:*

* Portugal has temporarily given all migrants and asylum seekers full citizenship rights, granting them full access to the country's healthcare as the outbreak of the novel coronavirus escalates in the country. The move will ""unequivocally guarantee the rights of all the foreign citizens"" with applications pending with Portuguese immigration, meaning they are ""in a situation of regular permanence in National Territory,"" until June 30.

personalfinance,Bank Offering 90 days no pay - to take it or not?,"Hello r/personalfinance,

My husband and I are in need of some assistance, I hope you all can help.

Both my husband and I are deemed 'essential personal' (he's a mechanic, I'm a teacher teaching remotely) so we are both getting paid, also my husband is disabled from the military so we get some money from there.  Today we got an email from our bank letting us know they are offering a 90 day break on our loan payments (we have a 15 year mortgage, 2 car loans, a personal loan and a credit card we can defer).  Interest will accrue but no late fees no hit to the credit report.  Our plan would be to defer the house (1200), and the cars (900) for the three months to get 6300 and pay off the personal  loan and the credit card.

Edited to add interest rates these are approximate:

House  - 4.2%

Cars &lt;approx&gt; 10% (I know this sucks, I have a recent divorce, and our debt to income wasn't great)

Personal loan (around 10 - this is totally my husbands deal done before we got married) 

Credit card  - 12%

&lt;please don't kill me on the interest rates, I know they suck&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure of the cost/benefit analysis here.  I am extremely debt adverse other than a house but my husband is not (as you can see) we are slowly chipping away at his past debt as I have none, and he wants to get to the none point as well.   My initial thought was that we would just keep paying our stuff and keep moving forward and he is the one that came up with the above plan.  I need some other opinions, both our families suck with money so I came to the next place I thought of.

investing,Options Basics: Log Returns and Volatility as a Function of Time,"**Before you read:** This is part of an ongoing series on the basics of options trading and valuation, focusing on stock options. This is the fourth post in the series. You do not necessarily need to read the preceding posts for this one to make sense, but please conder reading them first if you are not familiar with the following:

* The concept of equity. This is covered in part one: [https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/fdx8tw/options\_basics\_what\_is\_equity\_and\_why\_should\_i/](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/fdx8tw/options_basics_what_is_equity_and_why_should_i/)
* The concept of puts and calls as options on underlying assets, and how an increase in the volatility of the underlying asset can increase the value of options. You should also know, on some level, what the following stand for as they relate to options valuation: S, K, and σ. All of these topics are covered in part two, which also introduces a highly simplified version of the binomial model: [https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/fggids/options\_basics\_intro\_to\_puts\_calls\_and\_the/](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/fggids/options_basics_intro_to_puts_calls_and_the/)
* The time value of money and incorporating this concept into the binomial model, along with the concept of discount rates, including the riskless rate “rf:” :[https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/fjmkj8/options\_basics\_introduction\_to\_time\_and\_discount/](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/fjmkj8/options_basics_introduction_to_time_and_discount/)

This post will introduce the idea of log returns and show how to convert them to and from arithmetic returns (the sort of returns you are probably used to calculating). It will also show how to convert σ for one time period into σ for another time period.

Mastering these concepts makes option valuation far easier. This is more of a math post than a conceptual post. The conceptual posts are probably more fun, but math is what allows us to apply the concepts to actual options when we trade, so readers can expect a post like this once in a while.

**Math Knowledge I Assume You Have:**

* Basic arithmetic and fractions
* Exponents and what happens if an exponent is a fraction or is negative
* The concept of a logarithm (you don’t need to be good at them, just a vague idea that they are the inverse function of an exponent and that they have bases)

If you don’t know all of that, a couple hours on your favorite tutorial site will do the trick, or at least get you to the point where you can follow along.

**Important Terms for This Post** (for quick reference if you get a bit lost):

Continuous compounding: compounding (as in compounding interest) continuously. This is a theoretical concept.

e: e = about 2.71828. e is a very special number used in continuous compounding. Those of you who know a bit of calculus may be familiar with e. 

ln or “natural log:” A logarithm to the base of e.

**Continuous Compounding and e**

Consider a loan with an interest rate of 100% per year (I’m talking about APR for those of you who know about APR versus EAR). If the interest compounded once per year, then at the end of the year, the balance would be 100% higher than it was at the start of the year. If it compounded every six months, it would be a little higher than that, and here’s why: At the end of 6 months, 50% of the 100% would have accrued, so the balance at the end of six months would be 1.50 times the original balance. Then 6 more months would go by, and the 1.50 would become 2.25 (1.5 \* 1.5 or 1.5\^2). By the same logic, if the interest compounded every quarter, it would be a little higher than that (1.25\^4 = 2.44), and so on. 

Mathematically, if you were to call the number of times you compounded “n,” then you could say that the balance at the end of the year with a 100% interest rate is going to be (1+1/n)\^n. 

The upshot here is that even without changing the interest rate itself, compounding interest more frequently results in a higher debt balance at the end of the year. However, there is a limit to this effect. If you were to try the above equation with several different values of n, you would eventually notice that as n increases, the difference between the end of year balance using n and n-1 becomes smaller. In other words, the marginal impact of increasing n by one decreases as n increases. Put yet another way, the difference between n=2 and n=3 is far greater than the difference between n=200 and n=201. 

Eventually, if n is high enough, the marginal impact of increasing n by 1 is negligible because you are essentially compounding constantly. If you run some calculus, to find that value of n and find the balance at the end of the year, the balance you will get is about 2.71828. That number is very special in mathematics. We call it “e.”

A logarithm in base e is called a “natural log” or “ln”. The natural log of e is exactly 1 (ln(e) = 1). 

**Returns**

If you have an investment that grows from $A to $B over a period of time, **B/A-1 is the arithmetic return** over that period of time. You may be used to calculating arithmetic returns. If you aren’t feel free to DM me.

**ln(B/A) is called the log return.** For example, if your $1 appreciates into $2 over a year, your yearly return would be 100%, and your log return would be about 69%. The log return is smaller because **the log return represents the continuously compounded rate necessary to achieve a given amount of appreciation.**

I suggest using Excel for working with these kinds of calculations for learning purposes. The formula for natural log in excel is just =ln(). So for the above scenario, you’d write =ln(100%) to get 69%.

To convert a log return back to an arithmetic return, just raise e to the power of the log return and then subtract 1. Using the example above; (e\^69%)-1= about 100%. In Excel, the function to raise e to a power is =exp(), so you would write =exp(69%)-1 to get about 100%. 

All of this may seem a bit technical, but **dealing with continuously compounding interest rates is far easier** **than dealing with normal interest rates**. Let’s prove it by trying a problem two ways; first without converting to continuous rates and then by converting them.

You may recall from the last post that we had a practice problem that asked us to value an option that expired in 90 days. To do so, we needed to manipulate the rf in a complicated way because the rf we were given compounded annually. If you don’t remember what rf is, please take a quick look at the last post. 

Let’s say rf = 2% compounded annually. To get to a quarterly rate without using log returns, we would have to do something like this:

(1 + quarterly rf)\^4 = 1+rf

(1 + quarterly rf)\^4 = 1.02

1+ quarterly rf = 1.02\^(¼)

1 + quarterly rf = 1.00496 (use excel or a calculator to get the exact number)

Quarterly rf = 0.496%

To check our math, (1.00496\^4)-1 = 2%

Of course, we would need to do it all over if we wanted a different compounding period.

You’ll notice that quarterly rf was roughly annual rf / 4, but not quite. In options valuation, and really investment in general, you’ll need to convert rates to various time periods all the time.  While using an approximation just once may not make a huge difference, the little inaccuracies add up, so if you want to figure out rates without converting to log return, you really will have to go through that whole complicated process. 

Now let’s try it the easy way using log returns. You’ll see you can just divide the log return by 4, raise e to that power, and subtract 1.

On paper e\^(ln(1.02/4)-1 = 0.0496%

It’s that easy. In Excel, it’s just as easy:

exp(ln(1.02)/4)-1 = .0.496%)

Those of you who have tried a few trades may notice that options can expire in any period of time. Imagine how hard it would be to calculate a discount rate for something expiring 5 days out assuming 252 trading days in a year without using log returns! It would be easy to do with log returns: exp(ln((1+r)/(252/5))-1. 

Let’s say you owned a stock and you wanted to examine the historical annual rate of return using the last year of daily returns. Without using log returns, you would need to perform a complicated function where you manually multiply some imaginary balance by each day’s return +1, and then back into a result at the end of the year. If you had the log returns, you could just add them all together. That’s right, **the log return over any given period of time = the sum of all log returns during that period of time.** They don’t even need to be the same time period. For example, 12 hourly log returns + 1 daily log return is your log return for a day and a half. 

This property of log returns makes it ideal for valuing options over an awkward period of time, and you can calculate σ for any time period using log returns as well. For example, if you wanted daily σ, you can just use the standard deviation of daily log returns. If you use log returns for your discount rate and rf, you'll be fine to use log returns for σ as well.

Let’s say you wanted to convert σ from one time period to another without using returns data. In options valuation, you’ll need to do this often because it’s the only way to convert the time period for IV. Because σ is the square root of a variance, it’s a bit more complicated than just adding and subtracting, but not by much. Let’s say you had σ for a long period of time called σ(long) and you wanted to find σ for a short period of time called σ(short): σ(short) = σ(long) / the square root of long/short. For example, to get the daily σ using the yearly σ, assuming 252 trading days in a year; daily σ = yearly σ/sqrt(252). 

As a side note: be careful when you look up IV on a platform and make sure it is compatible with your units for modeling purposes, especially if you aren’t using Bloomberg, and particularly if you are using data from certain discount brokerages. For best results, if you are looking for mispricings, back into an IV using your model given the price, then see what the price is for whatever IV you think is most appropriate. If the prices don’t match up, consider the bid ask spread, and decide if you think there’s a trade. If you set everything up in excel or some other program beforehand, you should be able to make this process quick and easy. Using an API should make it even easier. **Don’t just trust somebody else’s data if you’re going to put money on it; use it as a sanity check and independently confirm.** 

Now let’s put it all together and easily value a call option we previously could not have valued without a ton of work. 

S=300, K=301, σ = 40% per year. rf=0.7%. Today and tomorrow are both trading days, and the option expires tomorrow. Assume continuous compounding and 252 trading days in a year. Assume, as we have before, that the price changes just once.

Let’s start with rf for 1 day:

0.7% / 252 = .0028%. That’s deminimus in my opinion. We’ll plug it in anyways, but this is one of those times you could probably use 0% and skip the discounting process. 

Now we’ll work with σ:

40%/sqrt(252) = 2.52%

300\*1.0252 = 307.56

307.56 - 301 = 6.56, so the option is worth 6.56 in the up state.

The option is already OTM, so it is worthless in the down state. 

50%\*6.56 + 50% \* 0 = $3.28 so FV is $3.28

3.28/(1+.0028%)= PV = 3.28 (the change was less than a penny)

So our call option is worth **$3.28**. Because we used log returns, valuing an option expiring tomorrow wasn’t really much harder than valuing an option expiring in a year or in any other amount of time. Remember that difficult put option problem from the last post? Log returns make life easier. 

**What’s Next?**

For the next post, we’ll start valuing options using more nodes in the binomial model, which will complete our basic overview of the binomial model. Then we’ll have a little fun with our complete model and look at certain kinds of hedging, put call parity (username relevant), and perhaps some other useful concepts. Then, at last, we will tackle the Black Scholes model. After that, I plan on talking about a few trading concepts that use all of these models to the trader’s advantage and tackling any nagging questions people have. 

If you enjoy these posts, the best thing you can do for me is to spread the word and tell people to follow me on Reddit. If you want more content, please message me or look me up on Patreon. 

**Challenge Problem: I’ll give gold to the first correct response as usual.** 

Part a) Let’s say we have a put option expiring 4 (trading) days from now. There are 252 trading days in a year. rf is negligible over this 4 day period. S = $100. K = $100. The call option is priced at $4. What is IV for a full year? Round to the nearest %.

Part b) Let’s say you buy the option. Given no other changes, annual IV immediately increases by 10% (so that if original IV was 34%, new IV would be 44%). After this occurs, you immediately sell the option. How much of a profit did you make? Round to the nearest penny.",finance

personalfinance,Should I refinance or hold off?,"Before all this mess happened, I had a plan to sell my condo and buy a duplex, but now I have no idea what to do and could really use some advice. I got very lucky with when I purchased it, as it's gone from a value of $158 to $200K in a little under 2 years. I don't think the market is THAT hot and wouldn't expect it to keep appreciating anywhere near that rate if I kept it, I just got a good deal.

&amp;#x200B;

My job is about as secure as anyone's right now, and I have an emergency fund I'm relatively happy with and for what I'd need to close on the condo, I should have enough leftover from a sale to have a healthy reserve fund for the duplex as well. my main two issues are that I have a pretty lousy interest rate on my mortgage, and I also have some concerns about the health of the building and the HOA's reserve fund, although it's also in a very desirable community in a hot market (austin). my current APR is 4.75, and if I apply by today for a refinance with my current lender, they'll wave their fees and give me 3.5%. I'm currently torn between 3 options:

1. Don't refinance, hopefully sell sometime in the summer and maybe I don't make quite as much off of the sale, but if that happens then I'm probably getting a pretty good deal on the duplex, and I should just be happy I dodged any major repairs or special assessments at the condo.

&amp;#x200B;

2. Refinance now and wait a year or so. The refinance is cheap enough that my break even point would get here pretty quickly, and even if I end up selling before that, having an extra $1200 liquid in exchange for losing $1500 in equity isn't TOTALLY unapallatable.

&amp;#x200B;

3. Refinance now and keep the condo for the long haul. I don't have to decide between this and #2 right now, but maybe it just makes sense to accept that I'm probably going to be hit with some major bills at some point, but in the long run keeping and renting out the condo and putting off a duplex for a much longer time makes the most financial sense. My main fear is that with the way the housing market is moving, I don't know when I'll ever be able to save enough to buy the second property.",finance

financialindependence,"FIRE Deflation Hedge, and more? The EE Savings Bond...","Hey All,

I'm a lurker/finance nerd, and usually don't post. But I am hoping the hive-mind may have thoughts about an addition to our portfolio I'm considering. It seems (relatively) unmentioned in these parts, yet I feel could fulfill a useful hedging role in some FIRE portfolios - [the EE Savings Bond.](https://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/products/prod_eebonds_glance.htm)

TLDR: Is there a place in FIRE for EE bonds, a comparative-illiquid investment vehicle that offers a guaranteed 3.5% yield after 20 years?

For those who are unfamiliar, EEs are government issued, with a 10k/SSN cap. They double in 20 years (e.g. 10k becomes 20k), but if redeemed even a day earlier are still only worth \~purchase price, so with each passing year, it becomes a bit less liquid/the opportunity cost for redemption increases.

Still, that represents an effective 3.5% APY if it can be held for 20 years. And EEs have several unique benefits, some of particular note for we HCOL area folks:

* Earnings aren't taxed until redemption, so that effective 3.5% is compounding without tax along the way.
* Earnings are exempt from state/local taxes.
* You effectively get a floating decade to actually cash them out once they mature (the lone taxable event), so you have lot of flexibility to avoid high-tax year or not spoil your Medicare income numbers.
* Further, if you are under \~150k (filing jointly) during that redemption year, payments towards a child's college expenses, or rolled into a qualifying 529, are spared from federal income tax as well.

My thought is, for folks like me and the SO that are more than 20 years out from their 60's and already maxing out all of our tax-advantaged options (401ks, IRAs, HSA and 529 to state tax cap) this is actually a pretty good deal. I'm musing on as much as \~20% of our taxable investments going forward, alongside a standard FIRE portfolio of index funds.

I feel the odds are very good that equities are the more lucrative choice. But, in the (let's call it &lt;10%?) chance that the ""Eek, Japan, deflation, sky is falling!"" chicken littles could even be partially right, setting this up as long-game, semi-tax advantaged CD ladder would make FI/RE a more likely outcome in our 50's.

personalfinance,Would freezing my student loan payments affect my credit?,"Hi everyone,

Did not specify but this is for the Fedloan, not my private loans.

Given that the payment freeze is going on for the next six months and given that I believe that things will get better over the next year or two, I would rather invest the money that I would put into the student loan into the market in stocks that are already quite low, or put it into my Roth IRA as a supplement. In other words, an extra \~$300/mo I could contribute to my retirement while stocks are cheapish.

Best case, several companies come out on top with solid dividends to prepare me better for a large purchase or retirement, worst case some companies fail and get bought while some companies end up coming out on top. Worst case, at some point I get return considering I'd be buying things that are at a five year plus low. Worst case, I do have what I feel is sufficient cash stockpiled in the event things go further south.

TLDR: I don't have a need to freeze my debt but at this point. Given that there's 0% interest and no payments, I have zero to lose in doing so with my Fedloan and understand that I will need to pay my private loan. Hate to exploit the crisis but I see this as opportunity, not a threat, to put more into my 401k since I have 40 years at least to worst case get a return at some point, best case have things go really well in the next few months. Does this freeze go on my credit score, and if so, does it have any chance in reducing my credit or does it have any chance of not allowing me to apply for other things like credit cards, loans, etc. while I'm frozen with the provider?

personalfinance,30 y/o undergraduate with almost all of my assets in HYSA/CDs confused about inflation and what to do next...,"Hi /r/personalfinance

I posted on here a few years back and got some good advice. I usually feel like I have my financial situation under control, but I have taken some big risks in my life over the last few years and the uncertainty with the Fed's interest rate, and other factors at play right now is leading me to seek advice. 

**A little background:** I am a full-time undergraduate student pursing a 2nd bachelor's degree in Botany in California with virtually $0 income. I have been accepted into a few PhD programs for plant science that are supposed to start this Fall (August). Pay for the PhD positions is about $30k.

I used to work in advertising in Los Angeles making quite a bit of money, and I got lucky with a few real estate transactions. As such, I have **$350k in cash sitting in a HYSA/CDs** with Marcus and PurePoint Financial. My plan was to invest in real estate (or another vector) after/during a crash and live off the money until then. However, I am now worried about inflation and I hope this money won't be worth nothing in a year's time. I don't know much about macroeconomics, nor how world events affect finances.

I wanted to ask here for advice on the best moves to make right now. I have worked hard to make and save this money, and this nest egg is the only reason I was willing to abandon a lucrative career in advertising to pursue a career in plant science where pay will be low (probably for my whole career with what I want to do).

Would it make sense to hold on to the cash and wait for a downturn in the real estate market, as was my plan? Should I try to buy property? The stock/bond market is so uncertain, but is this an avenue to consider? I really wanted to use this money to buy an investment home.

*Other financial details:*

*-As of today, \~$50k 401k and \~$50k IRA that is dwindling due to the stock market decrease*

*-\~$100k invested in private equity real estate deals (syndicated deals, similar to crowdfunding) that are/were income generating. My remaining deals here are slowing down and not offering income, and some are at risk of losing principle.*

*-As I mentioned, no income right now and not a huge potential to make much money in the future with my current trajectory.*

fintech,Opinion on Trends that Will Disrupt the Fintech Market in 2020,"Once referred to as an emerging industry, fintech has become an undeniable breakthrough category in business and financial services. Despite being a relatively young industry in terms of time, modern fintech is an independent field with its own trends and regulations. The industry has collected enough capital to peak vertically and start expanding horizontally. The velocity of the sphere’s development is only multiplying: **fintech funding in the third quarter of 2019** [**topped**](https://www.cbinsights.com/reports/CB-Insights_Fintech-Report-Q3-2019.pdf) **the total of 2017 funding, and six more unicorns emerged in 2019**. The fintech startups launched as local businesses, and now they dominate the market, as they managed to become industry pioneers. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9m8y5rl8c9p41.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=72d89be4a4dd39579242226e29dc622472009ec0

 The businesses that launched as fintech startups are stepping out their comfort zones due to their solid market positions. As a result, **they’re seizing opportunities to reach out to new demographics, introduce and test new products, and inhabit new locations. They’re now an integral part of the financial services value chain**. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/87llwh5cc9p41.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cddcf2171a259145ee3f1d2775c0066f2fac49d7

 The industry is following the worldwide trend toward the digitization of services which is influencing virtually every aspect of human life, including everyday financial operations. For example, the introduction of financial technology created alternative credit and rent-to-own formats for deals. Therefore, the inescapable observation of the industry today is that it is growing from its origins as a novelty sector into a mature financial field with stellar capacity. Furthermore, trends in this industry are global, and key players will need to be vigilant in order to keep up with the industry and remain potent in it. In this article, we analyze the fintech market and discuss the most important trends that will affect it in the coming year. We’ll also explain how to leverage these trends to keep profiting from this industry.  

## Fintech Market Trends in 2020

Today, fintech covers a lot of territory, including personal finance, insurance, billing, capital markets, wealth management, real estate, regtech, and cryptocurrency. All of these have their own individual specifications and emerging trends. However, if you connect them to fintech as a whole, the trends ultimately involve the industry’s most dynamic branches and depend on the economic and political processes arising from fintech’s globalization. Thus, in terms of geography, the industry is tending to target unoccupied locations in Asia and Africa. Meanwhile, British companies formerly within the European Union are maintaining their leading positions in the world. However, because of Brexit, they now face turbulence and uncertainty, which, in turn, is affecting related companies worldwide. The resources for new markets and customers in fintech in the UK are now declining and the future of these businesses is in jeopardy.

Based on fintech development in the above sectors and the global market situation, we’ve identified **five major fintech trends for 2020**:

1. Alternative lending
2. Real estate ownership in digital mortgages
3. Alternative payment flows
4. Stablecoins
5. Capital markets digitalization

### Alternative lending

Alternative lending works via online platforms through which traditional institutional borrowers seek investors looking for attractive investments. It started as peer-to-peer borrowing, and currently, most of the investors are institutional. However, the number of such deals worldwide reduced last year, largely because of regulatory intensification in Asia. Compared to the third quarter of 2018, the third quarter of 2019 saw a reduction in the number of deals and the amount of money extended via loans, according to [Global Fintech Report](https://www.cbinsights.com/reports/CB-Insights_Fintech-Report-Q3-2019.pdf) by CB Insights.

 At the same time, there is South-East Asia, which has an emerging collaborative ecosystem between countries which will profit from alternative lending. The position of the region in the global fintech industry will solidify when countries create flow through such frameworks as the pan-Asian Fintech Cooperation Committee and the Asia-Pacific Fintech Network. Lending will retain its peer-to-peer nature, but will be regulated and used by larger players. Therefore, the popularity of alternative lending will only increase in 2020. 

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, in the US, the alternative lending system has developed to the point where it can target not only SME stakeholders, but also students. This can help many people solve their student loan problems, which are severe for people who have no choice but to fund their education, and, as a result, overpay for it. Due to their unaffordability and the lack of other options, student loans become burdens for those taking them out and a problem for the government, as student-loan debt is increasing. In this context, an alternative lending model and income-sharing agreements (ISA) offer a long-awaited solution.

**Product example:** [**Edly**](https://edly.info/)

Edly is an ISA marketplace for schools, investors, and students. It helps schools enable their students to get an education and helps investors find schools interested in funding. The fintech aligns the interests of all the participants: schools, students, and investors. Instead of returning the debt, the student connects their future post-educational financial profits to the pools of ISAs. Thus, there is no such drastic imbalance between the loan and the debt, as is the case with student loans.

### New paths to real estate ownership through digital mortgages

There are two major tendencies in real estate fintech for 2020: the rent-to-own model, and cash guarantees. Both models facilitate real estate property purchases and create more comfortable purchasing conditions for buyers.

**1) Rent-to-own**

This model allows people looking for real estate deals to eventually buy a house without paying a mortgage. The rent-to-own agreement has two parts: the lease agreement and the option to purchase the property. The person that signs the agreement can buy the house within the period of the agreement. Here, buying the property remains an option, rather than an obligation of the party. Some agreements allow the lease payments to count towards the final purchase price.

**Product example:** [**Divvy**](https://www.divvyhomes.com/)

Divvy is an example of a successful implementation of the rent-to-own model. It works the following way: the client looks up available houses for sale and selects one they would like to rent and/or purchase. Then, Divvy buys the selected house and the client signs a rent-to-own agreement. White renting the house, the client builds equity with each payment.

**2) Cash-guarantee**

Essentially, in this model the company acts as a sponsor to the client who wants credit to buy a house or other real estate property. It’s a solution for people who are confident in their capacity to repay the debt but have certain issues with their credit record.

#### Product example: [Flyhomes](https://www.flyhomes.com/)

Flyhomes is a company that provides the cash to guarantee the deal for the client. The cash in this situation acts as a guarantor, which the person must have if they want to take out a loan for the house. If they don’t have anybody, they can use this service and close their deal.

### Alternative payment flows

This trend is dictated by the announcement of the US Federal Reserve about their plan to establish a real-time payment service that will simplify the process and work 24/7. The necessity for such a reform was also determined by technological advances and the speed at which people can recieve diverse services. At the same time, banking and payment systems remain quite conservative and slow compared to what technology allows today. Therefore, the US Federal Reserve [plans](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-fed-payments/fed-to-develop-real-time-payments-system-for-launch-in-2023-or-2024-idUSKCN1UV1XP) to introduce its real-time payment system by 2024.

The attempt to launch such a system was introduced in 2017, but was not supported by all the banks in the US. The announcement created a conflict of interest between smaller and larger banks. The former saw it as an opportunity to access real-time payments without having to pay significant fees to their larger competitors. The latter, in turn, saw it as a threat to their existing private infrastructure, which they would potentially have to share with the Fed. The future payment system aims to unify all the banks and hold them to the same standard of rapid, round-the-clock payments.

For fintech companies, this is a good reason to focus on alternative payment infrastructure and the bright opportunities in alternative payment flows.

**Product example:** [**Rapyd**](https://www.rapyd.net/)

Rapyd is a UK-based business that offers a range of financial services, including rapid payments. It also deals with fund collection, checkouts, foreign exchange, and much more. Targeted at e-commerce merchants, marketplaces and banks, the product is based on a single API and offers most of the services its users might need.

### Stablecoins: the new breed of cryptocurrency

In recent years, cryptocurrency has made a real splash due to the opportunities it opened up – not to mention the privacy, transparency, and security it offered. However, the major cons of cryptocurrency are instability in terms of rates, and unclear regulatory treatment. The cons proved to outweigh the pros for the traditional banking system, which is why financial institutions do not accept cryptocurrencies. For that reason, there is an emerging cryptocurrency that promises to combine the pros of blockchain and the traditional banking system: it’s designed to be as stable as the dollar or gold, and as transparent and secure as cryptocurrency. It is, logically, named Stablecoin.

**Product example:** [**Wells Fargo**](https://www.wellsfargo.com/)

Wells Fargo is a traditional banking and insurance company. In 2019, it created a pilot for its own stablecoin, Wells Fargo Digital Cash, which is backed by the US dollar. The company plans to run it on their own blockchain platform and only within the bank itself. If the pilot proves successful, the bank will use it for external operations.

However, certain factors are slowing the development of this potentially ideal currency format. The main factor is its reliance on the stability of traditional currency, which is tied to traditional financial institutions. For the stablecoin to be backed by traditional currency, it must establish traditional banking relationships with conventional banking systems. Here, the complication is that few banks are willing to take on this role due to compliance and credit risks. If stablecoin is backed by traditional currency, and then hacked, the bank backing it will incur an immense risk, which is why few banks are willing to jump on board with this idea or support its development.

Besides, there is the G-7 report that introduced new regulations to the cryptocurrency market and the operations within it. The problem is, before the report, blockchain had a lot more freedom, as it was not regulated, like a traditional financial institution. The cryptocurrency market had its own sandbox, which was disconnected from the global financial markets. The growing concern of the latter highlights the lack of regulation in the virtual currency world, which has weakened its position among traditional institutions.

### Capital market digitalization

Capital digitalization itself is not the newest trend. It started a while ago and proved to have a niche in the market. Today, there are many online platforms for private and business investments, such as Clear Minds. However, the emerging trend is expansion – specifically, exchange houses going digital. Evidently, this process will take a lot of time, but there are reasons to believe that this trend is on the horizon.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2yrj5kgpc9p41.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5280168eab305a8d2d22e02c4a4fe312d19884af

 

Particularly, the shareholders of the London Stock Exchange supported the exchange’s $27 billion takeover by the data and analytics company Refinitiv. The deal was overwhelmingly supported by LSE shareholders and received upvotes from 99.27% of participants due to the [“compelling opportunity”](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lse-m-a-refinitiv/london-stock-exchange-shareholders-bless-27-billion-refinitiv-deal-idUSKBN1Y01DD) they saw in it. The chairman of London Stock Exchange views it as being in the long-term strategic interest of the company. Digitalization of the exchange will allow to raise revenue as well as distance it from politically sensitive areas, and embrace data and analytics as an inseparable component of the exchange market.

Thus, the deal has become a certain signpost of the tendencies concerning both the fintech and capital markets. For exchange houses and shareholders, it means that the principal factor in exchange will become the search for profits, as opposed to the political background of the investment and the players.

## Things Fintech Companies Should Consider in 2020 to Survive

The trends we’ve reviewed each have a different development velocity and influence. However, they are shaking up the whole industry and its players, to some extent. To survive and profit in FinTech, a business has to navigate these changes and prioritize its goals. You don’t want to be overwhelmed with updates, but it’s crucial to know what companies need to pay closer attention to and follow the trends in this fast-growing industry. It’s best for a business to stay one step ahead of its competitors.

In that spirit, here are a few tips on what to keep in mind to thrive in FinTech in 2020.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/gyswi83xc9p41.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9a08ce9ca300c96c79e8cd1e895267de97ead007

 

### 1. Open architecture

You’ll want to prepare your product for integration with any API, which is why it makes sense to focus on creating interoperability. Regarding the trends we mentioned, products will gain new users, which is why companies should make sure products work equally well on different platforms. So, the goal is to balance cyber security, control, and accessibility, as well as to manage your product in the cloud. If your product is integratable with any API, it will be easier to adjust it to the needs of the market and emerging trends, as it will be possible to add new functions to the code you already have. Re-developing the product from scratch, in comparison, will require a lot more effort, resources, and valuable time, so you risk missing out, which is off-limits in the world of digitalization.

To make your product flexible and ready for integration, it’s best to use Python. In it, you’ll be able to modify your product’s parameters or features without making major or irreversible changes to it. Making sure you have great professionals on your team is another smart move you should make in fintech 2020.

&amp;#x200B;

### 2. Access to skilled employees

It may be an obvious idea that a company needs outstanding and motivated employees to grow. However, today’s industry is quite mature, which means there’s more competition among employers. It means that a decent expert can choose from a variety of options in the labor market, and their workplace criteria now go far beyond compensation and subject matter. For that reason, companies have to invent [new recruitment methods](https://djangostars.com/blog/hire-python-developers/) that are not limited to the financial industry.

Also, companies need to create educational and growth opportunities for their talent based on the future competency requirements and the expertise of the employee. With practical training incorporated in the company’s culture, it will be easier to navigate trends and adjust to new developments.

Another challenge that today’s employers face is the inability to find talent locally. Naturally, in this case, the search must expand worldwide, and recruiters must be aware of the migration policies for the talent they’re looking for. As an example, the UK is a current leader in fintech, but the Brexit situation might result in a shortage of human resources, despite sufficient funding in the industry. According to [International Financial Law Review](https://www.iflr.com/Article/3875510/Fintech-Europe-2019-key-takeaways.html), “Brexit has resulted in a lack of resources for new markets and customers for fintechs”, which, for companies, translates into an emerging need to find new ways to recruit the best employees.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/c0o4av24d9p41.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7af197467959c74e2c6b726497410dee0a43396f

 

### 3. Reduce costs by improving legacy systems and adopting AI

A number of human activities can be assigned to AI instead of people. The introduction of of robotics and automation will reduce the cost of human resources and optimize processes. Today, advanced robotics can perform not only jobs that require low skills and training. In fact, artificial intelligence can enhance the performance of, if not substitute for, higher-ranking positions.

The question of whether robotics will enter and change the approach to the intellectual workforce is not on the table anymore. Now, it’s only a matter of time. Thus, it’s in every company’s best interest to seek out opportunities to automate – today. Explore them, and figure out what potential benefits they will bring, deploy iterations, and adjust them to your particular business needs.

However, the launch of robotics will not mean a lack of workplaces. Conversely, you will soon need specialists that work with artificial intelligence, and they may be hard to find. This will both challenge companies to train AI specialists and allow them to save on wages in the future. In any case, artificial intelligence promises to become a vast part of fintech, which is why the best option is adopting it as soon as possible.

## Conclusion

Today, the main focus in FinTech is exploring and claiming niches that are underdigitalized or not yet occupied. Companies can invent new ways to reach users whose needs or problems cannot be fixed, and are sometimes even caused by conventional banking. For example, look to the solutions that allow people to get student loans or buy a house without overpaying. These are revolutionary. Another aspect of banking digitalization is its potential increase in scale due to the participation of exchange houses and the introduction of a unified instant payment system. It signifies that conventional financial institutions are now collaborating with digital ones to make services faster and more user-oriented. **The growing number of examples of successful collaboration between fintech and conservative financial systems only proves that the position of fintech will only strengthen**.

Finally, to survive the dynamics of the industry, fintech players should focus on the flexibility of their product architecture and be ready to adjust it to accommodate market and technological changes. To do so, these companies must have the brightest talent and provide these people with educational opportunities, including those in robotic technologies and automation. This year will also show which trends will solidify in fintech and which ones may lose their relevance, so it’s important to keep on keeping up with these trends.

personalfinance,Aging parents drowning in student loan debt. No end in sight,"Throw-away out of shame. Asking, no pleading, for financial advice for my parents and their ridiculous federal student loans. They're 130k deep.

My mom has recently dropped a massive bombshell on me, a real financial clusterfuck. This is the information that has been provided to me:

My parents live in WA and are getting old. My dad is close to 70 and does not work, has never really worked. My mum, who is 55, is a teacher making around 65k per year. They recently bought a house in late 2019 for 200k, using savings and aiming to pay it off in 5-7 years.

Turns out my dad has taken a student loan in the past to pay for his higher education and just let it grow. It is now at \~130k and increasing at 6%.

Anyway, since they're married and in WA, mom has been making payments towards my dad's ever increasing loan but it only covers the interest, never the principal which keeps on growing. It will only get worse from this point on. Mom has accepted the fact that she will have to work herself to death to just stay afloat, but there is no end in sight even after that.

What can my mom do at this stage? I do not want her to keep paying the loan interest until she dies, only to have the house repossessed to cover my dad's loans.

Are there ways to get the loan forgiven, or reduced, given my parents' age? Any programs for people in similar situations with loans they can simple never pay? Is there a scenario where they get the loan removed or lowered and keep the house?

Any advice welcome because I am desperate to help them crawl out of it.

investing,"Federal Reserve Considering Additional Support for State, Local Government Finance","https://www.wsj.com/articles/federal-reserve-considering-additional-support-for-state-and-local-government-finance-11585335550

Federal Reserve officials are reviewing new ways to support financing for state and local governments, many of which are on the front lines of the coronavirus pandemic and will face huge borrowing needs as revenues plunge, according to people familiar with the matter.

The economic-rescue legislation Congress approved this week asks the Fed to charge headlong into areas it has long considered taboo—supporting lending to businesses, cities and states. The Fed traditionally avoided intervening directly in credit and fiscal policy, preferring to leave such matters to Congress and the White House.

That is changing now because of the fast-moving economic crisis—and because Congress has essentially directed the Fed to get more involved by providing $454 billion to the Treasury to cover any losses in new Fed lending programs.

The Fed has dramatically expanded its balance sheet over the past two weeks, by nearly $942 billion to $5.25 trillion as of Wednesday. The central bank has lent freely to help firms avoid a wave of defaults that could turn a recession into something much worse.

What the Federal Reserve Can Do to Fight Recession
The coronavirus pandemic is disrupting the global economy. WSJ’s Greg Ip explains what the Federal Reserve can do to stem the damage. Illustration: Carlos Waters/WSJ

Over two weeks, the Fed has unveiled six lending facilities, five of them enjoying a total of $50 billion in support from the Treasury. Those programs have freed up cash for major Wall Street institutions and will backstop money-market funds and markets for commercial debt.

Democratic lawmakers have made support for city and state borrowing a priority in recent legislative talks, and the latest bill directs the Treasury secretary to seek a Fed lending program for municipal finance.

State and local governments are confronting skyrocketing borrowing costs even as they are straining to pay expenses associated with the spread of the virus. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told Fed Chairman Jerome Powell last week “to think big and help our states,” she said in an interview on PBS this week. “They are taking a big bite of this wormy apple and they need much more in terms of resources.”

Under its governing law, the Fed can’t directly buy corporate debt, and it is limited to purchasing municipal debt of six months or less. But it can work around these restrictions by creating lending facilities that lend or purchase debt, subject to approval of the Treasury secretary.

The Fed has already dipped a toe into muni-debt markets by expanding a money-market lending backstop to include certain types of municipal debt—and by purchasing some highly-rated municipal debt in a facility backing the market for very short-term commercial debt.

As of Wednesday, short-term interest costs on variable-rate municipal bonds have more than tripled compared with two weeks ago and are now higher than the rates governments typically pay on 30-year bonds, according to an index maintained by the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association.

Monday’s announcement by the Fed to include more municipal debt in existing lending facilities appears to have made only a small dent, bringing the index, which tracks bonds that adjust their rates weekly according to what investors are willing to pay, to 4.7% down from 5.2% last Wednesday.

Interest rates on other short-term muni debt that spiked last week have fallen after the Fed said Monday it would purchase some municipal variable rate debt. Rates on water, power and sewer bonds issued by New York City and Los Angeles fell back to their typical rates of between 1% and 2% Thursday after hitting nearly 8% on Friday.

Kent Hiteshew, who established an office of state and local finance at the Treasury Department in the Obama administration, has been hired by the Fed to advise on muni markets, according to people familiar with the matter.

Among the questions Fed officials are considering: Whether to expand existing facilities to accommodate other municipal debt or to launch a new facility devoted to state and local finance. Fed officials will have to decide which municipal debt might be eligible for support and on what terms.

There are limits to how far the Fed can lend using its emergency authorities. Its loans must be well secured, which the Fed typically satisfies by restricting borrowing to highly-rated issuers.

“The states and localities that need the most help are the most risky by definition,” said Ernie Tedeschi, an economist at Evercore ISI, an investment research firm, who previously worked in the Treasury Department during the Obama administration.

The Fed and Treasury brainstormed ways to support hard-hit state and local treasuries after the 2008 financial crisis, but opted against doing so.

Governments have been cancelling almost all planned long-term muni deals, borrowing they typically rely on for infrastructure needs and budget management, after investors fled muni mutual funds last week and prices plummeted. There was $761.7 million in total muni issuance last week, according to Refinitiv, compared to around $8 billion during a typical week earlier in the year.

Government borrowers include states facing high Medicaid costs, delayed income tax collections and huge drop-offs in sales taxes as commerce has slowed to a standstill—and municipalities that run hospital systems, nursing homes, jails and public-health departments.

""As our borrowing costs go up, that’s fewer dollars they have to allocate to the crisis,” said Matthew Chase, executive director of the National Association of Counties.

Fed officials have long had broader philosophical objections to intervening in financial affairs of subnational entities. The central bank is the fiscal agent of the federal government, and they have viewed state and local finance as the domain of Congress and the Treasury Department.

“The Fed’s response has typically been, ‘Look, if the federal government wants to support state and local finance, they can do that directly,” said Lewis Alexander, who served as an economic adviser at the Treasury Department from 2009-11 and is now chief U.S. economist at Nomura Securities.

“There is a real reluctance to blur the line between the federal government and the state and locals. You start going down that road, it’s hard to know where to stop.”",finance

Bitcoin,Interesting fact about BTC in person trades.,"\*\*I'd rather not to mention the country I'm from for privacy reasons, but I can tell you that my county is industrialized and one of the worlds tech centers.  


So we have a group where people could buy and sell bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies, people simply post B/S with the amounts they desire, and other people respond if they're interested, in 90% of the cases they meet in person.  


I'm actually one of those who have built and raised that group, so I've been there from the start.  
Usually you'll see people selling 1-5% down off the price, and to see people selling with premiums is very unlikely, last time I've seen people selling with premiums was back in 2017 when bitcoin rallied all the way from 6k to 19k.  
And this came back after the last drop, for the first time after 2017, this has inverted, people are selling with premiums on the price and buyer agrees to pay higher price for BTC.  


I find this very interesting and can't wait for halving to take place to see what will happen then, when the supply will be even lower.

A month ago before all this covid thing became really serious me and my spouse signed a reservation and paid 3k€, it is not refundable and we will have to request a mortgage next Monday or pay 10% of house price if decide not to proceed. 
It is our first time buying a house and we’re almost ready to stop where we are, loose 3k and wait for housing prices to drop to find something ready to live in. 

We love this apartment, neighborhood and price seems to be pretty reasonable but it also seems to be risky to buy in current situation.

investing,The market in a slightly larger view,"I don't know what the market is going to do. Neither do you. But there are things that we can be more or less confident about. The combination of those things, plus your investment time horizon and appetite for risk, should allow you to make smart long-term decisions.  Here's my take on what we do and do not know. 

**High confidence:** 

* **We will develop a vaccine within 1-2 years**. This is an enormously disruptive but ultimately short-term hit to the economy, assuming we manage the business/economic dislocations smartly. 
* **The federal government will continue to prop up businesses and individuals**. The utterly deadlocked Senate and Executive Branch, riven by truly ugly partisan politics over the past three years (a President literally impeached and acquitted), came together in record time to deliver major pieces of legislation to address some of the economic dislocations. And the political leaders on both sides have said that what's happened so far only takes us to the middle innings at most. We are highly likely to continue to get major federal action. 
* **The course of infections and burden on our health care systems can be managed**. We literally know our future. We can look at other developed countries that responded to this outbreak and observe our current news tracking their past trends. In Italy and elsewhere, social distancing is working, even if it was implemented too late. Infectious disease experts know and have predicted the course of this virus, and are saying we haven't hit the peak yet; but can flatten the curve with the right measures. Many people will suffer, but the vast majority will be okay (physically). 

**Low confidence:**

* **How many businesses and individuals will be economically devastated**. While the government will act to preserve the system, it cannot dictate outcomes. Many companies will go bankrupt, many people have already lost their jobs, many others will follow. How many is difficult to tell right now, as it depends on a variety of interacting factors, including the effectiveness of our health care response and the types and levels of continuing government support. 
* **How low the stock market will go**. The stock market had the most severe and sudden crash in a century. However, it hasn't declined as much as even an average bear market - and this seems to be more than your average economic calamity. It's reasonable to expect it to go lower; but it could just be in for a period of volatility without any clear direction. A full recovery in the next month or two seems very unlikely absent a proven vaccine, which is also very unlikely simply because of the amount of time it takes to test even developed medications. 

From the above, *at this point* I think it's fair to say the severity of the economic catastrophe is not fully known, primarily because we don't have a solid end-date of when relatively normal economic functioning can resume. However, we can have fairly high confidence that we will eventually recover and be on decent economic ground when we do. That suggests that if you are comfortable with riding/handling volatility in the short term, you can and should have started to invest some in the decline so far, and can continue to do so. Those that are more risk-averse should be more cautious, investing less of any cash on hand until a clearer picture emerges. You may lose some gains, but may also prevent yourself from making dumb decisions.

personalfinance,Dad wants me to move out ASAP,"23 year old male. I have $3200 in cash. No debt. No credit. 

Unemployed now because of the COVID-19.  I was making $11 an hour,  30 hours a week as a janitor before they shut the place down. Started taking general credits at a community college in January. 

My dad hates that I live here. He cannot stand being around me and has be constantly telling me to move out. I told him to please let me stay here so I can save money. I got out of prison at the beginning of last fall with $400 to my name from working while I was at the halfway-house. I have been working since I got out until the coronavirus left me unemployed.

I have filed for unemployment benefits a few days ago but do not know if I'll be eligible or what.

I do not own a car, but I do I own a bicycle. If things get too bad here I'm thinking I could buy a tent and live in that until I have enough income to risk signing a lease. I live in a small town in a rural area. 

I have no credit to speak of. I have never taken out a loan or owned a credit card in my life.

I am wondering what I should do? Should I buy a used car and sleep in it? Or save my money and sleep in a tent? Or should I just sign a lease for an apartment without knowing if I'll have the money to afford it if I can't find a better paying job in the future?

I have a federal felony for Conspiracy to distribute controlled substances on my record. Job experience includes dishwashing and custodial type work. I do not use drugs and can pass a drug test.

I can really only work part time because college takes up a lot of my time. Should I drop out?

My dad will not support me much longer. I need to get out of here for my mental health anyways, as he is emotionally abusive to me.

Currently 26 Years old with the following:

Roth 457(b) contributing 10% with no employer matching, balance is approximately 15k

Roth TSP: Contributing 15% with 6% government matching. (These contributions are small, as they are reserve paychecks for one weekend a month).  (6k balance) 

I do not currently have an IRA. I have a state government pension after 25 years of employment that will pay approximately 100k annually. The pension will be federally taxed in retirement, not state or locally taxed. 

The question: would it behoove me to keep all retirement accounts as Roth options, including possibly opening a Roth IRA, since I will have taxable income in the form of a pension? It seems as if using anything other than Roth would only raise taxable income even higher in retirement.

During the winter quarter I had quite a hit to my mental health. I needed to stop and reassess myself and get some serious counseling and a bit of medication. I dropped my classes and planned to resume schooling in the Spring for my last quarter. All of my schooling was being paid for through financial aid such as grants and federal loans. 

When I dropped my classes I ended up going below a class credit limit that I did not know about. Because of this, all my my financial aid fell through and my spring classes have been dropped due to non-payment.

I have been attempting to contact anyone at the school for advice and help but there’s not much in the field of counseling being offered right now due to COVID-19. A “financial expert” from the school just gave me some links to financial aid and places to get another loan.

I now have a bill in hand from UCDavis for around 7000.00 dollars that I must pay by April 15. If I were to pay for this I would need to muster another 5000.00 for the spring quarter tuition fees. One of the main reasons why I attended UCDavis is because they were giving me such great financial aid that most of my schooling was paid for. And now I’m being left high and dry.

To make matters worse, my wife and I have no work because our jobs are school related and hourly. I just don’t know what to do. Should I take out a ~20000.00 loan in order to stay afloat and get my last quarter done now, or apply for more financial aid and take the last quarter in the fall? Any advice would be great!",finance

Don't trust hot wallets, I dont think I can trust the same phone I use to look at porn on my lonely work trips with access to my BTC lol.

I thought about memorizing my seed, wiping HW wallet, FedEx, restore on location.  This seems ok, the risk being a fuckup with shipping or my employer switching locations on me next day and I fly elsewhere.  Not sure if that can be dealt with at FedEx or whatever.  I don't like the idea of potentially not having access to my BTC for days or longer, new ledger nano is like a week from France.

I do travel with a laptop.  If I had a seperate boot partition on there I'd keep clean and offline for everything but BTC transactions I should be relatively safe to restore a wallet on there or no?

personalfinance,Initial Disclosure/Mortage Loan,"Hi all,  


First time posting on this sub and hopefully can get some advise from you fellas. So I'm first time home buyer and currently working on the loan process with 2 of the lenders. This is a new build so the builder would like me to use their prefer lender (Lets call this lender B). Unfortunately, I only qualify with FHA loan from lender B but I was qualify with conventional loan with another lender (Lets say lender A). I can put down 13-15% for the house so here're my questions/concerns.  


1. How can I find the current rates for my state (I'm from TX). Lender B offer interest 3.99 with 4.735 APR. And lender A offer 3.75 interest with no mention APR in paper. I know due to pandemic, FED is cutting the rate, so shouldn't the interest rate must be lower? I know that rates are based on a number of factors such as credit scores, loan to value, loan type, type of home, debt to income ratios and of course how the bond markets are performing at the time. But I was expecting to be much lower than what they offer.
2. Since I put down more than 10%, how can I remove the MIP if I choose lender B. And are the lenders would use the interest rate base on the initial closure or the new rate by the time that I'm ready to lock in. I just want to keep the rates low as possible.
3. I'm in a dilemma between 2 lenders. Lender B is good because they offer 6K on the closing cost but I just don't want the FHA. Lender A is with conventional (which I prefer) but they didn't offer anything much and their rate is the same when they provide me a initial fee worksheet 2 months ago (I have a pre-approval letter from them when I was first looking at older house, but now I change my mind and find new build home is better).  


 I know this is kind of long and a bit of confusing, but please advise. I really need some honest opinions from experience peeps so I can made a better decision or at least I can negotiate with them. Thanks in advance.",finance

investing,What the Actual Fuck is a Stock?,"I currently work in equity research for an asset management firm so I have had a good amount of experience researching companies, reading through sell-side reports, GAAP/Non-GAAP financials, press releases etc. But I keep banging my head wondering, what the actual fuck am I betting on with stocks?

For example, is its earnings growth? Is it revenue growth? An earnings beat? Best case scenario, it is free-cash-flow to equity which would technically be the cashflow that equity investors would be entitled to. But that's not the case at all. In fact, if a company goes bankrupt, most of the time, the only people who get paid out are the bondholders - sometimes portions on the dollar (#PG&amp;E). So what are we even betting on? 

All these philosophies like value investing, growth stocks, GARP, etc, etc. which try to take a certain angle on stocks. All that seems to be really happening is that you're noticing an inflection point in what you believe matters to other people (could be earnings, could be cashflow, could be revenue growth, could be managerial). And how you make money is that you see this inflection point, or growth story before the majority of others do (volume). Thereby securing yourself a low entry price point and over time, people will come to realize that the company meets those metrics and they'll put money on it. But who cares if revenue grows if it literally never pays you back? Sure there are dividends. But companies don't pay high enough in dividends to warrant the kind of speculation and premiums we pay on stocks. When's the last time someone saw a DDM or cashflow DCF in a sell-side report or market consensus estimate?

Another thing is that you could be right, but no-one cares. For example, you believe FCFE will become healthier for the company in the next 5 years as they pay down debt and optimize their supply chain. 3 years in, and cashflow is healthier than ever (everything else equal/improving), allowing the firm to spend more money on capital expenditures, invest in projects and generate greater returns/gain an edge over competitors... But the stock price lags the market. Because no-one else is looking at those metrics, nobody cares. I've seen this countless times where a company could be doing well on all standards on which it was judged previously but then all of a sudden, the stock no longer reacts to that kind of information. People shift from caring about earnings to revenue to the balance sheet (during a recession) etc.

In contrast, when looking at bonds, that type of investment vehicle makes perfect sense. Company A needs $1000. Person B has $1000 so they loan their money to Company A. However because there's a certain risk involved, the risk being they might not get their money back, they charge an interest rate, along with expecting initial principal payment at maturity. That makes perfect sense. And I can see what one would be looking for when buying bonds. Buying stocks is way less clear to me. 

The bottom line is, stocks to me feel more like a game of predicting where will people buy next, and then can you put your money there before they do. They feel more speculative than ever. The OG stock the Dutch East India company made sense and indirectly created the world's first stock but since then things just have felt pure speculative.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

NOTE: Please absolutely feel free to critique me, call me out, say I'm retarded. I am really confused and I am hoping someone has an answer to this, much like the bond example. It just feels like sometimes I have no idea what the fuck I'm betting on. Yea I can forecast to a pretty good degree (in bull markets) whether or not the company growing their revenues at x rate is plausible, or whether or not competitor X will gain share and how that will affect them. But as long as someone isn't willing to buy a stock, it will never go up, no matter how ""good"" it might be.",finance

*****
&gt; Everything from auto sales to manufacturing surveys and employment data in the coming week will likely paint a bleak picture of how much the first weeks of the coronavirus shutdown have already hit the economy.
*****
&gt; Market turbulence is expected to remain high, though volatile moves in the past week were largely to the upside. The S&amp;P 500, by Thursday, had soared 20% intraday off its Monday low, before giving up some gains Friday. For the week, the S&amp;P 500 was up 10.3% at 2,541.
*****
&gt; The market’s rip higher ignited a debate about whether stocks have now bottomed, and that discussion will carry on into the week ahead. Some major investors like billionaire investor Leon Cooperman and BlackRock’s Rick Rieder believe stocks may have hit their lows. Other strategists say the market needs to see a retest before a bottom can be called.

&gt; “It’s amazing to me that people are so bullish when virus cases are accelerating and economic growth is deteriorating,” said Richard Bernstein, CEO Richard Bernstein Advisors. “I could see it if cases peaked out, and the economy is troughing.”
*****
&gt; # It’s the economy
&gt; In the coming week, the big number to watch could again be Thursday’s weekly jobless claims, up a record 3.2 million for the week ended March 21, as the shutdown of stores, restaurants, and other businesses across the country resulted in immediate layoffs. 
*****
&gt; Economists expect several million more claims to be filed for the past week, and they are looking at that new claims report as potentially more important than Friday’s March employment report. The survey week for the March jobs report was ahead of some of the major shutdowns by the states most impacted by the virus. Economists expect nonfarm payrolls to drop by 56,000 in March, according to Dow Jones.
*****
&gt; Other data could show some of the early signs of an economy brought to a standstill. There are auto sales and ISM manufacturing releases on Wednesday, both March reports. Service sector data will be released Friday.
*****
&gt; Market focus will be more intensely focused on the economic data, shifting from the $2 trillion aid bill, signed by President Donald Trump on Friday. Economists expect the economy already may be in a slowdown and that it should trough with a double-digit decline in the nation’s gross domestic product in the second quarter.
*****
&gt; Vehicle sales will be reported Wednesday, and sales are expected to have come to a near standstill even though shuttered dealerships continue trying to deliver autos to buyers.
*****
&gt; For “car sales, I would think the drop would be more precipitous,” said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton. “They shut down in every major market. Even though they’re offering deliveries and all that stuff, it’s going to be a shocker ... large double digit decline.”
*****
&gt; Auto sales were at an annualized pace of 16.8 million in February, and some economists say the number in March could be closer to 12 million.
*****
&gt; Congress passed a $2 trillion aid package to help put cash in the hands of workers and companies, so they can weather the effects of a shutdown.
*****
&gt; Separately, the Fed has delivered a massive amount of monetary stimulus that has helped ease up some of the problems in illiquid credit and even the Treasury market.  It has been buying Treasury and mortgage-backed securities at a record pace of $70 billion a day, and markets are focused on when the Fed will alter the size of its purchases, which are open-ended.
*****
&gt; “This week, plus last week was more than $600 billion. It’s monumental.” said Michael Schumacher, director, rates at Wells Fargo. The Fed said it was reducing the purchases to $60 billion a day, which is the amount it had been buying in a one-month period.
*****
&gt; # Stimulus one-two punch
&gt; The double-barreled boost to markets from the Fed’s policy and the prospect of the fiscal spending package helped fire up the mid-week rally in stocks. 
*****
&gt; “Even though the market, from the intraday low on March 23 through the intraday high on March 26, soared more than 20%, which to many is the definition of a new bull market, this low must be sustained before a new bull market can be crowned,” said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. “We’ve got to maintain this recent low, in my opinion, for another six months before we can call this another bull market.”
*****
&gt; Stovall said the S&amp;P 500 is often higher in April, though this year it may not be. The S&amp;P is down about 14% for the month of March so far. Since World War II,  April has been the second best month for the S&amp;P, which has been up an average 1.5% and higher 71% of the time.
*****
&gt; The big rally in stocks this week is not an unusual occurrence in a bear market, Stovall said. “There have been multiple times in history - 1973/1974, 2001/2002, and combined with 2008, 2009, that we saw 20 plus percent rallies before ultimately setting an even lower low.”
*****
&gt; Stovall said it’s likely there will be a lower low. “The only think that causes me to say we may not retest the bottom is everybody is saying we need to retest the bottom,” he said. The S&amp;P hit a low of 2,191 before bouncing higher.
*****
&gt; # Credit un-crunching
&gt; In addition to its Treasury and mortgage purchases, the Fed has cut rates to zero, added liquidity in the repo market and committed to creating vehicles to help corporate paper, municipal bonds and corporate debt.
*****
&gt; “Stress levels in financial markets have receded in a meaningful way this week, thanks in no small part to the Fed’s aggressive moves.  Leveraged loans rebounded somewhat in price yesterday, and the MBS market is seeing broadening improvement (though it is far from normal),” noted Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont.
*****
&gt; Stanley said the Fed may not need to buy corporate bonds for now, based on new issuance activity in that market this week.

# Will the Fed’s Bold Moves Keep Yields from Rising?

&gt; With the major stock market indexes all entering a bear market this month, it’s no surprise that stocks have stolen most of the spotlight. However, actions taken by the Federal Reserve (Fed) to support what may be considered the safest part of the bond market, US Treasuries, may actually have more lasting implications for investors’ portfolios.

&gt; From February 19 through midday March 9, the yield on the 10-year Treasury fell an incredible 125 basis points (1.25%), briefly reaching an all-time low of just 0.31%. In fact, the 14-day relative strength index RSI on the 10-year yield, a technical measure of momentum, was more oversold than at any point since 1971. Since then yields came roaring back, trading as high as 1.27%, before fading back to near 0.8% currently.

&gt; It is logical to think that the incredibly bold moves from the Fed, including unlimited Treasuries purchases, will help keep yields down. But could yields actually rise from here after the Fed writes the bond market a blank check? History says yes, which seems counter-intuitive. For investors, it’s important to keep in mind that the combination of low starting yields and rising interest rates may lead to meager future fixed income returns.

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, following prior announcements of quantitative easing (Fed securities purchases), yields have actually risen. Part of that story is the market pricing in higher inflation expectations as a result of the “money printing.” Another piece is the market becoming more confident in economic recovery. “The massive injection of liquidity into the bond market by the Federal Reserve—in concert with fiscal stimulus—surely helps shore up the economy and credit marekts for an eventual recovery,” noted LPL Financial Sr. Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.

&gt; LPL Research forecasts the 10-year Treasury yield will end 2020 in the range of 1.25-1.75%. Outcomes outside of that range are certainly possible depending on how long it takes to get the pandemic under control.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Yields-after-QE.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; If the roughly $2 trillion in fiscal stimulus is added to the Fed’s securities purchases, and additional lending capacity that the Fed’s new programs create, the economy will get a $5-6 trillion jolt in the next several months to help us get through this crisis to the other side. In a $22 trillion US economy, that is significant and far exceeds the stimulus that dug the economy out of a ditch after the 2008-2009 financial crisis. This human crisis is not over unfortunately, but the bold moves from policymakers should help lessen the blow. The size of hit became evident in Thursday’s massive spike in jobless claims. The economic data will get worse before it gets better, but visibility into the peak of this crisis is starting to come into view and markets—both stocks and bonds—may be beginning to sniff that out.

*****

# Making Sense of Skyrocketing Jobless Claims

&gt; Weekly new jobless claims were reported this morning, and to no one’s surprise they rose to levels thought unimaginable just a few weeks ago. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, 3.3 million people filed new claims for unemployment benefits in the week ending March 21, almost 5 times the previous high of 695,000 set in 1982.

&gt; “The personal and economic disruptions represented by the latest new claims number are staggering,” said LPL Chief Investment Officer Burt White. “This is a genuine human crisis, and a robust response from the Federal Reserve and Congress seems appropriate. Unfortunately, we do expect more numbers like this in the coming months. At the same time, markets are forward looking and will be more focused on how quickly we might be able to get to the other side.” Per LPL’s Chart of the Day:

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Blog-Chart-20-03-26-New-Claims.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; While the number of new claims is extraordinary, it’s not entirely unexpected. The United States and countries across the globe have shut down entire segments of their economies in an effort to delay or disrupt the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Many of the jobs most impacted by social-distancing measures, such as cashiers, restaurant workers, and hotel staff, are in the services sector, which now makes up about 80% of the jobs in the United States.

&gt; There is no silver lining in a number like this, but there is reason for hope. The US economy was not in a recession prior to the global spread of COVID-19. Workers are not being let go because of some structural fault in the economy or a financial crisis. As a result, when the slowdown ends, we may not see the extended hiring delay that has typically followed recessions. In fact, a surge in demand may require extra hiring, although it may not take place until people are fully confident that social distancing is no longer necessary.

&gt; Markets may not be responding to the dramatic numbers seen this morning, but they have been absorbing the rapidly changing economic expectations it represents over the last few weeks. We’ll see a lot of this over the next couple of months: historic numbers with markets seemingly unmoved. But it’s not because they’re indifferent. Economic data is slow moving and backward looking, while our economic reality has been changing at an unprecedented pace. Even new unemployment claims, which are released weekly, seem somewhat stale. Markets will still be reacting to shifting expectations of the depth and duration of the slowdown, as well as the effectiveness of policies to help businesses and workers get to the other side.

# Market Volatility Stresses Liquidity

&gt; The COVID-19 pandemic has caused unprecedented volatility in recent weeks that has investors and traders scrambling to assess the economic and market impact of the aggressive containment measures.

&gt; This past week the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), which measures the implied 30-day volatility of the S&amp;P 500 Index based on options contracts, measured its highest reading since its inception at over 82—besting the prior high set during the financial crisis in 2008-2009, shown in the chart below. That is saying something.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Blog-volatility.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; As market participants have sought shelter from the storm in traditional safe havens such as US Treasuries, gold, or cash, we have seen signs that liquidity has dried up. All that means is buyers have become more tentative, demanding lower prices to get trades done due to the historic volatility and heightened uncertainty. That in turn can lead to wider bid-ask spreads for market participants—both retail investors and institutions—and we sometimes see a dollar of value selling for 95 cents, if not less.

&gt; We have seen some of this in the corporate bond markets in recent days. Even short-maturity, high-quality investment grade corporate bond strategies have seen market prices disconnect with their fair value, as measured by net asset value (NAV). That metric essentially adds up the value of individual bonds in a portfolio such as an exchange-traded fund, which should in theory match the market price of the security that we all see on our screens.

&gt; “In volatile markets, quality items go on sale to clear the racks because there aren’t a lot of shoppers walking through the malls,” noted Ryan Detrick, LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist. “Improving liquidity in all markets can help restore investor confidence after being shaken the past few weeks.”

&gt; At their worst, these conditions can translate into serious dislocations, such as those experienced during the financial crisis when banks didn’t trust each other enough to make overnight loans and credit froze up. Short-term lending is a necessary lubricant for economic activity.

&gt; Investors can get hurt selling into these dislocated markets. This is where the Federal Reserve (Fed) comes in. The programs the Fed launched on Monday, March 23—including buying large amounts of corporate bonds—are aimed at restoring health to credit markets. The central bank’s aggressive bond purchases (as much as needed) should help restore orderly trading in corporate bonds and narrow spreads, a measure of risk, which have widened significantly in recent weeks. As shown in the chart below, spreads are still well short of 2008-2009 highs.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Credit-spreads-blog-chart-for-3-24-20.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; There is some other good news here. These dislocations can present opportunities for buyers to get discounts they may not otherwise see in normally functioning market environments. We aren’t suggesting running out and buying securities trading at the biggest discounts to their intrinsic value. Instead, we are highlighting that attractive opportunities are emerging in the corporate bond market, particularly in strategies focused on strong companies that may emerge on the other side of this crisis as leaders of the economic rebound.

# Time In The Market Versus Timing The Market

&gt; The incredible volatility continues, with the S&amp;P 500 Index now in one of its worst bear markets ever, along the way making the quickest move from an all-time high to down 30% at only 22 days. What is a long-term investor to do?

&gt; “Although market timing is very alluring to investors, especially after the past few weeks, the reality is timing things incorrectly can set you back significantly,” explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “In fact, if you started in 1990 and missed the best day of the year each year for the S&amp;P 500, your annual return was nearly cut in half.”

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the annualized return for the S&amp;P 500 from 1990 to 2019 was 7.7%. Yet, if all you missed was the best day of the year, that return dropped to only 3.9%. Miss the best two days of each year, and you were up less than 1% a year. Taking it to the extreme, if you missed the best 20 days of each year, you’d be down 27% per year.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/chart-3.24.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; No one can consistently pick the best or worst days of the year, so this is why it can be so dangerous for investors to miss time in the market by trying to time the market. If you miss one or two big days, compounded over time, this can greatly impact your portfolio.

# Boeing (BA) Sends the Dow Flying

&gt; Turnaround Tuesday has carried into hump day with the Dow up well over 5% again today as of this writing. As we mentioned in an earlier post, that means the Dow is on track for its first back-to-back up days for the first time since early February. Remarkably, even with only two consecutive up days, the index is closing in on exiting a bear market. For that to happen, the Dow would need to close above the 22,310.32 level which is 20% off of the bear market closing low (Monday's close at 18,591.93). At today's high, the Dow was less than 300 points or 1.32% from that level.

&gt; As for the individual stocks contributing to the rally, Boeing (BA) deserves a lot of thanks. The stock has been hit very hard during the sell-off. Whereas the stock has traded in the mid-$300 for much of the past two years and up to mid-February, as of late last week BA had fallen below $100. That massive drop in price means that day to day movements in the stock would have a lesser impact on the level of the price-weighted Dow. In spite of this, BA has contributed over 400 points to the Dow's rally in the past two days alone! That is much more than any other stock in the index with the next biggest contributor being UnitedHealth (UNH) who's 335.44 point contribution comes as its share price is currently around $100 more than BA. BA's contribution is also almost 200 points more than those of McDonald's (MCD), Visa (V), and Apple (AAPL). Of all 30 Dow stocks, there is only one that is down over the past couple of days, subtracting from the index's rally: Walmart (WMT). Given WMT has held up fairly well recently, its performance is yet another example of investors' focus on the more beaten down names that we have noted earlier today and in last night's Closer.

Even people who are current can take advantage of this. Just wondering if anyone has heard or knows anything about how this would impact people on IBR. My loans are so embarrassingly high that IBR is the only way I can live so I don’t want Navient pulling some shady crap when I apply for renewal of my IBR plan at the end of this year that would jeopardize my ability to continue using the program.

personalfinance,"Should I Use the ""Emergency Forbearance"" for my IBR Fed Student Loans?","I am about 5 years out of law school and must pay over $900 a month for  my federal student loans on an income-driven repayment plan.  If I keep  this up, in 15 years my loans will be forgiven; but at my present pace,  my loans grow every month, because the IBR payment does not even cover  the interest. I feel like I got scammed, but that is not the point of  this post.  At first, I read that you could claim the ""emergency  forbearance"" and the time would still count towards pay off.  If true,  taking the forbearance seems like a no-brainer, since zero percent  interest and still getting credit towards the 15 remaining years of  indentured-servitude.  When I went on myfedloans, though, there was a  vague disclaimer that seemed to suggest that the forbearance period  would *not* count towards the time  limit. Does anyone know the truth?  What would you do?  On the one  hand, I can technically make the  $900 a month payments, but doing so  requires me to be almost totally broke ( I have a lot of overheard,  being a provider, etc.), whereas if I was able to take a six-month break  on making these stupid payments, that could give me a cushion, which  may be very important depending on how things develop.

personalfinance,What to do about dad’s student loans? Please help,"My dad is 70, and has been able to not default on his student loans, which are now close to half a million dollars, due to his always having very low income and him being locked into a high interest rate for decades.

Now, though, Navient rejected the paperwork he submitted to continue his income-based payments, and his monthly payments are about to skyrocket to 5k/month. He has no job, and his plan was to live off his wife’s retirement, but she passed away last fall, leaving him two nice-but-not-that-nice houses, one of which still has a mortgage and is being sold. He has no retirement accounts, except for some cash savings that are definitely not enough to pay back the loans; even if he does pay the 5k/month, those savings won’t last long. 

He’s worried that he’ll be homeless if he can’t continue the payments. He’s thought about transferring his limited assets to my name, but I’m not sure if that’s legal (we’re in Colorado, if that makes a difference). He also owes my mom money, which I desperately want him to pay back first. Ideally, I’d also like to have some assets available for my brother when my dad passes. 

Should he transfer assets and go into default? Or pay the 5k/month and then go into default when cash runs out? 

Also, if you think there are terms or loopholes that you think he should explore, please comment them. I’m going to try to get him to meet with an attorney soon about this, and it’d be nice to have some direction. Thanks everyone ❤️",finance

Our savings has enough to cover our expenses for around a year. I know we don't need to have that big of an emergency fund so recently I've been looking at what we can do with it. Before the Corona craze, a friend of mine I trust advised getting a house, as me and my wife have been in an apartment for 3 years. We got a pre-approval and made an offer on one house but sellers chose another offer. We haven't found anything since. My grandpa knows a lot about stock markets and he advised me earlier this week to start investing the money we would use for a house and put it in stocks.

I've done some basic research online and on this subreddit. I'm looking into what my company matches on 401k and will start contributing to that asap. The next thing that seems to be on the list is to pay off high-interest debts. Right now, we don't have a lot of debt. I have a little student debt but the interest rate is low so not really motivated to pay it off. We have a car loan and have been making bigger payments than the minimum to pay it off quicker. My wife has a little bit in student loans but she's still in school so we're not making any payments on that so far. Then just credit cards that all have nothing or a hundred or two on them.

After jailing Dr. Li Wenliang ([who eventually died](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-51364382)) for spreading ""dangerous misinformation,"" the Chinese government enacted an unprecedented lockdown that quarantined 11 million in Wuhan and 57 million in 15 other cities in the Hubei province starting on January 23, 2020. Chinese state-owned news media lauded President Xi for acting so swiftly and decisively to ensure the safety of the public health. ""It only took seven weeks,"" remarked one Chinese health official. ""That is definitely a record.""

Meanwhile, in January 2020, Americans preoccupied themselves blithely following the Trump impeachment hearings that were destined to go absolutely nowhere. When asked in January how she intended to convince the Republican-controlled Senate to impeach President Trump, Majority Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, simply shrugged.

""Ultimately,"" Pelosi remarked, ""the American people generations from now will care about this Kabuki theater. For posterity's sake, we needed to have it recorded in the history books that at least we tried.""

Beginning on Tuesday, March 24, markets surged on a three-day rally recovering 23% of lost ground all the way to 3:30p on Friday; the Dow managed to reach 22,327 before people came to their senses and realized that one wanted to hold a ticking time bomb over a potentially volatile weekend.

personalfinance,Where does additional W4 Withholding Reflect On My PayStub,"I got whacked on 2019 taxes so I used the easy to follow IRS withholding calculator that told me what to additionally withhold on my W4. I updated the W4 to withhold an additional $110 Federal. I file as married jointly. Also updated with my employer so that I have 0 state deductions. 

I just got my new pay statement and to my surprise, it didn’t go down much. I am withholding an additional $110 in federal, it looks like with  that additional $110 amount, my net pay dropped $50. My total taxes went from $1339.73 now to $1379.56 so an increase of $39.83. My federal tax went from $589.48 to $620.64. For reference I am paid 2x per month so 24x per year.

Maybe a dumb question, but I would’ve thought adjusting this would’ve just caused my federal tax amount to increase $110. For example if I was getting taxed $100 federal on my wages I thought it would’ve gone to $210.

personalfinance,PSLF and the federal loan suspension,"So not long ago, I went through the process of having my Navient loans transferred to MyFedLoan in anticipation of PSLF down the road. I'm currently about 3-4 years from reaching the 120 payment threshold. 

A few questions about the latest news about the loan suspension:

(1) Everything I'm reading seems to imply that all federal loan lenders are supposed to cease billing people within 15 days I believe. Does that mean we as borrowers need to request a forbearance before then, or does it happen automatically? 

(2) MyFedLoan currently says I have a payment due on April 14th which would normally be paid via autopay. Will that be pulled from me like normal, or should the loan suspension prevent the payment from happening? 

(3) Did I read it right that those months where loans are suspended will count towards the 120 payments for PSLF?

Thank you in advance for answering. Bonus points for those that link me to legislive text or credible websites that support your answer.",finance

personalfinance,Student Loan - Best Repayment Option,"Hello! Looking for some advice on my current repayment plans for my student loan balances. 

Total owed: 65k
Total with interest rate at 5% or higher: 40k

I'm currently on a PAYE plan. Based on last year's adjusted gross income, my required payment is $0 (and each month of the $0 payment counts towards the 240 payments needed to forgive the remainder of the balance.) 

My partner and I recently combined our budgets with the goal of paying these down. All of our daily expenses are covered by his income, while my income funds our savings, my business expenses, a small vacation fund and my student loans. This lets me pay $800-$1500 per paycheck to my student loans (targeting the highest interest rate first). 

I've been trying to figure out the best way to calculate if paying off the loans is really in our best interest. While the interest rate is high, they will be forgiven after a designated number of minimum payments. Partners concern is that we're essentially betting on my income NOT increasing, which is unlikely. 

Is there a calculator that would allow us to figure out at what point we are paying more than we should be towards this balance? I want to somehow take into account an increase in income, the tax that I'd pay on the forgiven amount, etc.

We both do a Backdoor Roth contribution in case my bonus pushes us above the maximum contribution threshold. However, FreeTaxUSA isn't letting my wife do this. It is forcing her to take the $6,000 Traditional IRA deduction.

personalfinance,"Prioritizing liquidity vs. paying off $18,000 in credit card debt?","Hi everyone, using a throwaway account here for privacy reasons. Hoping to get some advice and guidance on our financial situation, thank you in advance! **Given the ongoing and upcoming economic fallout from COVID-19, we're not sure if we should continue to aggressively pay off our credit card debt or fully prioritize staying liquid (or where we might fall on the spectrum somewhere in between those two options).** Below is an overview of our situation.

**Income:**My partner is a software engineer making $88K/year. I work at a non-profit making $60K/year. We file taxes married but separate filings due to my federal student loans. Both of our employers have expressed that employees should not be concerned about job security in the short- to medium-term. My employer has even indicated that raises may be coming in the next few months. Obviously we are still being cautious, but both of our organizations/companies do not seem to be too impacted (yet) by what is going on. We are updating our resumes and still looking for other positions just in case.

* ***Total: $7715/month*** *(after taxes)*

**Expenses:**We live in NYC so rent is our largest expense at $2390/month. Utilities are included, and my organization reimburses internet expenses as I work from home. Below are a few other combined monthly expenses, excluding fitness and transportation as those are currently suspended due to COVID-19:

* Rent: $2390/month
* Therapy: $800/month
* Phone bill: $175/month (includes Netflix and other family members' bills that we cover)
* Groceries: $400-600/month
* Private educational loan: $488/month ($4800 remaining total)
* Federal educational loan: $165/month (\~$35000 remaining total; enrolled in PSLF program and paying minimum payments)
* Hulu: $7.99/month
* Spotify: $10/month
* Adobe subscriptions: $15/month
* Dental insurance: $39/month
* ***Total: $4150/month***

**Credit card debt:**Due to a big move a few years ago, a gap in employment, and some recent medical expenses, our total credit debt currently sits at \~$18K. Here is a breakdown:

* Credit card 1 (15.99% APR): $1897
* Credit card 2 (21.49% APR): $5400
* Credit card 3 (17.99% APR): $425
* Credit card 4 (0% APR until November 2020): $5056
* Credit card 5 (0% APR until January 2021): $5286
* ***Total: $18064***

**Savings:**None, unfortunately. We've been prioritizing paying off credit card debt before a recession hits. We weren't quick enough. We've been hit with unexpected expenses; for example, just a few months ago we lost $2200 due to a family emergency.

**Miscellaneous:**We wanted to include that we anticipate receiving \~$3000 for our tax returns here soon. We also anticipate we'll be receiving some of the stimulus checks if that is passed (\~$1700). We include this as we're not sure if that's money we should set aside in savings rather than put on our credit card debt as we had originally intended.

Again, our question is: **how do we balance or prioritize paying off our credit debts and building some emergency savings in the coming months?** Our instinct is to get rid of this credit card debt once and for all–we're *sick* of carrying it around–but I've heard that sound advice is to stay as liquid as possible during a potential recession (or worse). However, we do have medium confidence that we will keep our jobs in the short- to medium-term.

Thanks again in advance for your help, and hope everyone is staying as safe as possible.  


EDIT: We also forgot to include that together, we have \~$15K in our 401Ks (it's taken a beating over the last few weeks). We've considered taking the penalty to apply this to our credit card debt so that we could focus on building savings/emergency fund more immediately–but we're not sure if that's the right move.",finance

personalfinance,Advice on moving and budgeting for my dream job?,"I got offered my dream job at the Monroe Carell Jr. Children’s hospital in Nashville, TN in their Pediatric ICU. However, my base pay is only going to be $25/hr, night shift from 7-10pm is $3 differential and 10p-7a is $3.50 differential (this is a night shift job but I will be on dayshift the majority of my 8-10 week orientation). Weekend differential is $6/hr. Work 4 weekend shifts (so 2 Friday’s, 2 Saturday’s or 4 Friday’s or however you want it) in a 6 week period and self scheduling. And they have really good tuition reimbursements through Vanderbilt for me to go back to school.

I really want to take this job. I currently work in a Neonatal ICU and the environment is so toxic. The managers suck and a lot of the nurses are just flat out mean and make your night a living Hell if you aren’t part of their “clique”. It’s a very clique-y, high school environment. However, I currently make $24.48/hr plus $2 differential for nights and $3 differential for weekends and then we also make a $2/hr “acuity” differential that basically says we’re so short staffed, please stay and we’ll give you an extra $2/hr. I’m also required to work 2 Friday’s, 2 Saturday’s, and 2 Sunday’s in a 4 week period, and we’re required to do 2 overtime shifts a month. So I make decent money, but the stress of this work environment and all the requirements and such are killing me. I’ve been here a year and a half and the requirements have gotten worse and the toxic environment has gotten worse. 

So I want a fresh start and I want to leave but Nashville is going to essentially end up paying me the same and it’s a double cost of living there. Plus I have a lot of credit card debt, student loans, and car debt that I want to pay off. Right now I pay about $900/month for rent &amp; utilities. And I’ve been able to pay $1250/month towards my credit card debt and student loans and $430/month towards my car. I know if I move to Nashville rent and utilities will end up costing me probably around $1300/month and with my car and phone payments that puts me around $1900/month before food and pet necessities and therapy and such. My take home pay for those 8-10 weeks of orientation is probably only going to be $2500/month. 

I know we’re about to get a $1200 stimulus check and Vandy is offering me a $3000 relocation bonus (it’s taxed and comes on my first paycheck) so now is kind of a good time to move as long as I can get decent overtime at Vandy.

I feel like I’d be crazy to pass up such a great opportunity but I just don’t know if I can afford it.",finance

This scheme essentially merges the Fed and Treasury into one organization. So, meet your new Fed chairman, Donald J. Trump.

In 2008 when something similar was done, it was on a smaller scale.

personalfinance,Someone else is using my SSN and nobody has been able to help,"I have spent countless hours attempting to resolve this issue over the past 5 years. I have been to my local SSA Office and called the head DC Branch with no luck, in fact I was told I'm pretty much screwed, while laughing at me, by the individual I was speaking with at the DC Office. I am an identical twin and have a consecutively issued SSN to my twin. when I run a credit check on myself using my information I always get my report back, with my info. When someone else runs it, 50/50 it will come back with my number and a different persons name. 

Legally, I am not allowed to have a copy of that report, which I have been informed is what I need to take to the SSA Office to dispute or resolve my problem. On one occasion I was kindly provided the name of the individual and was able to google them, I have since lost this info when my old computers HDD died. It would appear that this person has a home, boat, two cars, etc., all using my SSN. I am currently in the process of attempting to apply for unemployment and both the state and federal SSA databases are reporting that my surname differ on the database. 

I have attempted to open bank accounts at several banks and told that someone already has an account using my social and denied any additional information and most recently the hospital where I was also informed that someone was also using my SSN. In the past, I have frozen all three lines of credit and signed up with a major credit reporting company to monitor my identity but that seems to have done absolutely nothing, my guess is because this person is using their personal info and my SSN. 

I am at a loss for what to do at this point. :( would applying for a new SSN work and what info would I require to validate my reason for applying for a new SSN, I believe I was told that I would need a copy of this other persons info - which is something I simply haven't been able to obtain :/ Any help or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.",finance
investing,IMF head confirms global economy is now in recession,"The head of the International Monetary Fund said Friday it is clear that the global economy has now entered a recession that could be as bad or worse than the 2009 downturn.

IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said the 189-nation lending agency was forecasting a recovery in 2021, saying it could be a “sizable rebound.” But she said this would only occur if nations succeed in containing the coronavirus and limiting the economic damage.

“A key concern about a long-lasting impact of the sudden stop of the world economy is the risk of a wave of bankruptcies and layoffs that not only can undermine the recovery but erode the fabric of our societies,” she told reporters at a news conference following a telephone conference with finance officials from the 24 nations that make up the IMF’s policy-setting panel.

She said the IMF was updating its economic outlook now and it would be released in a few weeks, allowing the agency more time to assess the economic impacts of the virus.

Asked if the United States was now in recession, she noted that Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell had said Thursday that America “ may well be in a recession.” She said she believed not only the United States but many other advanced economies and a number of developing countries had already entered downturns.

Georgieva said lower income countries were being hit hard by the spreading coronavirus, with 81 nations now seeking support from an IMF emergency financing program being used to provide aid.

personalfinance,"Sorry, but this is another ""should I refinance"" post.","I'm sure people are sick of seeing these questions, but I would like to get some neutral advice before I talk to any banks about this. I will admit that I'm kind of ignorant about a lot of this stuff, and it seems like it is deliberately complicated in a lot of ways, so I wanted to see if anyone can tell me if it would be worth the effort for me to refinance my mortgage.

I got my mortgage in 2013, 7 years ago as of February.  I did some reading, but I know that I probably didn't do enough and could have made some mistakes.  I didn't really have a lot for a down payment, but I found out about this program in my state through FHA, called the Georgia Dream Program, that provides down payment assistance. It's a $7,500, interest free, 2nd mortgage, that I somehow got the impression that I wouldn't have to ever pay back as long as I stayed in the house for at least 5 years. I later found out that I was confusing that with another similar program I read about called ""good neighbor next door"", where you have to buy a shitty house in a shitty neighborhood.  So, I found out that if I ever sell or refinance my house, i will have to repay the $7,500.

I was also under the impression that after i had 20% equity in my home, I would no longer have to pay for mortgage insurance. I later found out that doesn't matter with FHA loans, and I will have to pay MIP for the life of the loan. I also read something on a website about this where they were talking about how you have to pay 2 mortgage insurance premiums for FHA loans. One that is rolled into the loan, and one that is monthly. 

""Borrowers who use an FHA-insured home loan to buy a house are required to pay:

  -  an upfront mortgage insurance premium (MIP) that’s 1.75% of the base loan amount, and
  -  an annual MIP that’s usually* 0.7% for a 15-year loan, or 0.85% for a 30-year loan.""

So, if i did refinance, would i get that 1.75% taken off the payoff amount ?

The payment includes amounts that go into an escrow account for property taxes, home owners insurance, and MIP. I know the property taxes have gone up some over the last 7 years, and the MIP has gone down a little bit, but my loan info is showing it at about $75/mo for the last few months.

My home owners insurance was $666 for 2019. I saw that it was $712 for 2020, so it's going up every year.

My monthly payment started out around $550/mo and has gone up every year and just went up again from $626 to $657/mo.  I realize that part of the reason for the increase is because of home owners insurance increases and property taxes. 

It is a 30 year FHA loan.

My initial loan amount was $88,500

My effective interest rate is 2.875%

My current principal is $73.995

I'm wondering if it would be worth the effort to try to refinance to keep from paying the mortgage insurance since I'm almost at 20% equity. 

I realize that I could possibly shop around for different home owners insurance to see if I could save some money there too, but I'm really wondering about the mortgage insurance stuff and if I can get out of paying that.

I also know that I would have to repay the $7,500 if I refinance.

Would it save me money in the long run to refinance if I could get a decent rate? (I have an excellent credit score)

What rate would I need to get to make it worth it?

Thanks in advance.",finance
personalfinance,Seeking opinions on refinancing our current home with the goal of purchasing an (additional) income property.,"Our single family home was purchased in 2008, mortgage was $150k total. When my husband and I got married we started paying an additional $150-300 per month towards the principal and currently have $121k left at 5.5%. Similar homes in our neighborhood are selling for $175-200k.


Considering the historically low rates, we are able to refinance through our local credit union at 3.5% for 30 years, 3.375% for 20 years, or 2.75% for 15 years.


We have two car loans totaling $39k at interest rates between 2-4%. $5k in credit card debt, which will be paid off over the next couple months.


Current gross income for both of us is $110k per year.


Our next financial goal is to purchase a multi-family home with the idea of renting out the units to cover the mortgage of that property and our own. We aren't looking to get rich off income property, just put ourselves in a better position in the long run. Ideally it would be a three family.


Anyway, my opinion is we should refinance the full value of the house, take the lump sum from equity and put it in a high yield savings account to have on hand for a down payment when we find the right property. Our taxes and insurance are roughly $300/mo. For an (estimated) 180k mortgage, it breaks down as:

* 30 year, monthly payment $808, total w/ interest $290,981 (only minimum paid, no additional principal)
* 20 year, monthly payment $1,032, total $247,777
* 15 year, monthly payment $1,222, total $219,873


I hate to potentially pay more in interest, but I lean towards the 20 year. My reasoning behind this is during ""good"" months when we have the units leased, we can cover the minimum payments of both mortgages, in addition to applying more towards the principal of each every month. During ""bad"" months, when units are vacant or costly repairs arise, we would have a bit less overhead.


Would this make sense? Or is there a better way to go about things? Thank you in advance.",finance

personalfinance,When am I supposed to pay the 10% early withdraw penalty on 401k?,"Hi there,

In Dec of 2019, I cashed out my entire 401k amount ($13,040) from a previous job due to personal circumstances. I paid all the necessary taxes at the time (both federal and state) and I knew that I would also have to pay the 10% early withdraw penalty when taxes were due this year. However, I just completed my taxes via FreeTaxUSA, and it didn't withdraw the $1304 penalty... When am I going to pay this? Is the IRS going to send me a notice via mail that I owe it? I'm just a little confused on when to expect this. Thanks!

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: Here's the summary of what they took out already. They took 20% for federal taxes and then the state took theirs.

investing,"Well, perhaps market manipulation sprinkled with a tech revolution?","A fair amount of what was prospected in my post last week pretty much hit directly on the head (Not trying to say I'm a trading savant or anything like that at all hahaha)... But to run it back, Gold hit practically exactly as I had called last week (putting it back within its base LT up-trending channel, Bulish vibes); Monday brought low futures &amp; weak hands across the board early on which prompted people to turn to commodities... Both the S&amp;P 500 &amp; DJI dropped to test lows that haven't been seen since prior to trumps stepping into office; that was until major investors stepped in, stimulus hype kicked in &amp; ya know, the printer got fired up XD....  I've been securing small of profits along the way with swinging scalps but ultimately am looking to have had great long positioning with most of my portfolio, at least until the dust seems to settle more (perhaps the second week of April or slightly later after the stimulus check had been received/ the economy is able to proceed amidst the chaos of the virus); having done fair bits of extensive digging following where Friday's close left us at, it's insanely peculiar across the board to say the least....

Before getting to analysis &amp; projections, I first need to lay out new findings. There's been posts / articles floating around detailing specific bills put in place following 'The great recession' in 2008; articles which claim, following this great financial crisis in 2008 our gov't had taken steps which effectively merged both the federal reserve and treasury into one entity, which \*allegedly\* is under the supervision of the executive branch (more specifically, the president / whatever his or her team sees best fit for the current situation.) Moreover, the federal reserve is able to exchange securities within the stock market in order to recoup these 'debts' in a similar way that it would with bonds or other collateralize securities traditionally. {See details regarding the federal reserve &amp; trading equities to recoup debts as detailed in 2005 [here](https://www.frbsf.org/education/publications/doctor-econ/2005/november/monetary-policy-stocks-sale-purchase/).}

One last thing I must lay forth before going into analysis; the previous link is the best I can find which might 'validate' the updated bills, and an update was added to the base of that web-page following the 2008 crisis which states, "" On November 25, 2008, in the height of the financial crisis the Federal Reserve announced that it would begin purchasing up to $100 billion in agency debt and up to $500 billion in agency mortgage-backed securities. Since that time it has announced several other large-scale asset purchase programs."" Following that line of text with a link which claimed to be 'access to their balance sheets' or 'the evolution of the FED's security holdings... and that link has since been deactivated. (WE ARE TALKING ABOUT A LINK THAT WAS POSTED ON A LEGITIMATE ORGANIZATIONAL WEBSITE) So yes, I am accepting the information presented on these bills/laws as true; and before continuing to read this post you will need to 'accept the above terms and conditions' lmao (Seriously tho, feel free to further contest them or try and validate the claims as you please, I have done a fair bit of research but haven't found anything concrete that contests the claims laid before us in the circulating articles.)

So what do these provisions mean? By accepting the above claims, it would basically mean that our gov't has the power to be actively playing 'the big short' in the stock exchange, targeting various failing sectors (taking the positions from large scale investing firms or openly in the market). More specifically sectors which have been lagging behind economically / they do not see fit to push our economic growth in the LT future... (The ability to pump up a market &amp; make it look appealing enough for common investors to act amidst a slew of market uncertainty/upcoming catalysts) Mind you this is ALSO while having open access to infinite market manipulation at virtually no cost , and realistically are yielding FAR more profit on these these initial debts they're inuring currently. The bills/provisions would have theoretically made it quite literally impossible for any average trader to ever capture the 'full move' (as our fellow in 'the big short' was able to) on failing/financially jeopardized sectors ever again; effectively allowing them to throttle economic transformation, all while the FED is now milking maximum profits out of investors of dying industries before these investors even have a chance to understand that they are invested into a failing industry / company.

Now to begin analysis, in this mass hysteria I have seen a few varying correlations following the real world catalysts which have been in part driving the markets sentiments; correlations which have been getting glossed over here and there, but most posts highlighting them have had their factors barely or overly attributed to the crash in this event. Correlations have been between: speculative currencies (think crypto/ gold - see gold's live chart [here](https://gyazo.com/ad3d69694dd54ec9d0e76f258895c200)) and their ability to gain more strength than the US dollar in the future (relating to an underlying market-sentiment &amp; desire to return to its bullish ways as the value of the US dollar appears to be in jeopardy), the current state of oils price relative to the warmest winter recorded in 20 years and how it impacts our energy sectors in the market, overall playing into the markets sentiment), and the state of the NASDAQ following Friday's close (An underlying desire for bullishness in the markets, specifically in companies which are already extremely prosperous and arguably not only be practically unimpaired by CV but will only continue to grow more profitable in the near &amp; LT future of the economy; with a need to begin weeding out the weaker companies in our economy which can be found in the Dow Jones or even still in the S&amp;P 500.) So if you can imagine, each of these three correlations have had major catalysts within the last month which impacted where they stand from a long term perspective and have upcoming catalysts which influence the speed of which they recover and how they do. Essentially I see this playing out as a market recovery that's never been seen before and realistically never could've been seen coming in such a way; ultimately leaving the majority of investors burned &amp; nearly all scratching their head for a period of time to come.

Oil is currently at a key tipping point, it's bouncing off of its $20 support and OPEC has a deadline of drawing a resolution by April 1st (It has been reported that US officials have recently been in contact with Russian officials with the desire to reach a conclusion with OPEC &amp; non-OPEC members, reassuring Russia that american companies will also comply with the reduction in oil supply &amp; proposing that other non-OPEC members should do the same.) The drawing of a conclusion is just the catalyst oil is in need off to send it running back up closer to where it was once valued/ a fair price point.. This fuels my belief that oil is truthfully dying out in our countries energy sector (If you look at energy companies listed on the NASDAQ, they're renewable companies, not oil drillers/refineries) and ultimately those which are investing into oil for a long term position will inevitably just be giving their money to the gov't unless they plan to simply swing the catalysts at play currently. {See oils long term chart - [here](https://gyazo.com/81647bd368e7ea096c1521a10f9e1058)}. Notice that oil had almost totally crashed out before the 'Tech bubble' occurrence. I speculate that oil had become most profitable/ most sought after in the late 1900's before new age tech became more and more relevant, there were literally people &amp; companies researching Fuel Cell technology for cars &amp; renewable sources like mainstreaming solar panels; that is, until company heads started dying &amp; I'm sure the gov't/world leaders came together looking for a conclusion, ultimately finding an equilibrium in supply &amp; demand whilst no other competitors were able to threaten them &amp; it seemed everything was playing in their favor, and as a result we can see oil price totally moon leading up to the 2008 recession... This peak is the true foundation for our long term downtrend, renewable energy sources began to rise in relevance and the general population has been so supportive of it that there has been simply been no other choice but to milk the oil industry as much as humanly possible similarly to how someone would play a biotech approval (OPEC meetings, trump pushing to send american oil production to the moon in order to 'make our economy more profitable.' However, it appears to me as a massive pump &amp; dump to trap LT-dividend investors within, slowly draining their net-worth &amp; the income they're receiving in the form of dividends from these companies (Now, a company like Exxon has a WAYS to go before any of the small drilling companies, but on the fundamental principle of oil price slowly draining out over the years, so would these oil/gasoline suppliers/companies - see Exxon LT chart - [here](https://gyazo.com/b375043db48e0144f3cf0b49d9dd4912).) Exxonn set a new high in 2014 and has never been able to recontest this, it's been trapped within a downtrend ever since then, not only that but about the time that oil had completely gone to the moon in the midst of the recession it appears that someone might've opened a short position on Exxon at $117, which is has NEVER touched since then; the closest was in 2014 when it touched $105 / share (the true start of its long term downtrend). Also notable on the chart, despite 'growing revenues' since 2016 exxon/other oil based energy providers haven't been able to create any kind of a LT uptrend which holds solidly in YEARS. This is factor number one in the week ahead imo, when we get news about this/ if a conclusion is able to be drawn by OPEC will be critical within the markets recoveries... CV is literally only playing within the bears favor on really weak handed investors / scalpers at this point; the markets are throwing hella bullish signals &amp; i promise you that the Algos will not be ignoring them in this week to come, which will only act as another elevating factor for the markets in this war to ultimately kill off what seems to be mainstream Bearish vibes from trading communities/ day traders.

To discuss the NASDAQ - of all the major indexes, the NASDAQ is the only one which doesn't appear to lay in totally bearish territory {[Chart here](https://gyazo.com/5a9eea562ae1992801e50d2c541e7ceb)}. This is what interests me the most, the NASDAQ has bounced off of its up-trending channel that was set in 2016 (the SAME channel which was FINALLY able to break the long term resistance from the Tech Bubble fallout &amp; create a bullish new high along with the rest of the markets at the time - reference the purple line in the image.) Now, the grey line &amp; green trend lines are representative of the 'limitations' and the 'support' of our economies growth following the great recession in 2008... this massive fallout happened just as the NASDAQ had touched this line of resistance, and I believe this recovery will act as a spring board momentum which could send the NASDAQ onto another level. Why do I think this? Because the NASDAQ is comprised of the companies which LITERALLY define the future as we all know it... Heavily loaded Social media companies &amp; innovative tech companies; then only gives way to the top travel agencies (the modern economy has been driven by 'experience' buying more than ever before,) renewable energy companies/prospects, household 'brands' (think pepsi,) banks, the nations top health care companies (yes, some of which will be leading the charge against CV - GILD, Abbott.)

What am I trying to say? I believe we are watching the foundation or further development of the transfer of wealth from many LT investors/401K owners into our government's pocket, all while the economy is undergoing a 'silent revolution.' Now this could take years to fully play out, and I believe this is why many economists will continue to look at this event and just scratch their head on what the significance was or why exactly our stock market had a never before seen recovery (Possibly it will be attributed to the common scapegoat at the moment - ""the FED is just printing money until the problems seem to resolve themselves."") Perhaps more catch on or the event plays out in an extreme fashion as more and more investors seem to read between the lines here &amp; flock to the 'companies of the future' as they continue to increase revenues &amp; outshine their outdated counter parts.)

""But EXLR8, what about the overhead concerns pertaining to the current condition of the USD value, its strength in an economy, and how it relates to the overall buying power of the consumer?"" Well, to that I would say this concern is barking up the wrong tree, especially with the conditions which are put before us in the articles detailing the fed's 'improvements' in investing strategies.. These strategies totally dismiss any desire for our gov't to back our dollar (per say, adopting the gold standard, or switching to a crypto-currency - view crypto's current 'trend' [here](https://gyazo.com/dfc18132e0c4a67eef22c4eeaac68db0)) because then it would limit their ability to 'adapt' to the severity of the 'situation' presented. Especially while considering how they are handling this process, they aren't printing money which will forever stay in circulation, this money will be put back 'into the reserve with interest' once big investors decide they want to return to their positions; also, if im not mistaken this would even allow for them milk MUCH more money than they've injected into the dying markets by recouping it on short positions. (To clarify, am I bullish on Gold or Crypto? Yes, but they aren't entirely related to the primary factors currently at play, at best these factors just opened the opportunity for a great buy in time on crypto/gold.)

How does this effect our investing strategy moving forward? Well personally, I'm going to be focusing companies which I see playing a MASSIVE roll in our society's future / will be able to 'keep up with the times.' At least until this situation plays out more, and I'll certainly be on the lookout for anything the market seems to throw at us which appears to disprove this theory. However, currently I haven't found anything which compels me in another direction or to just leave it and say ""ahhh corona-virus is the fall of the US/world economy, I can't invest right now.""

Pieces of further analysis: Current state of the SPY (S&amp;P 500) - [here](https://gyazo.com/bdd2e4e6ee506c2e05ba10b6cffa0488). Key takeaways - Fridays close left us above the long term uptrend established in 2016, which was the trend that pushed our markets into higher highs. The selloff seen this month was quite literally the most dramatic EVER seen, worse than the height of the 2008 sell off, and FAR worse than at any point during 'the tech bubble.' I view key support as \~247, and while the bears have been screaming about the looming 'death cross' I don't think algo's or investors will give a damn about that one indicator, especially given the hype that will be generated following the clearing of OPEC's deal this week... (I believe the closing of the OPEC deal will give the oil sector enough of a relief to ignite buying within various other sectors/companies that appear equiped to overcome the quarantine period / appear as tho they can come out on top of their industry/niche.) Example 2 of a dying sector - [VIAC](https://gyazo.com/a31664d0ad2e2d8aebe12767c8d1f66f). VIAC had been a major company which many investors thought 'could never fail.' However, look at the LT downtrend it has been stuck in since 2014; which directly correlates to the rise of streaming platforms (NFLX) which was a power house even before the 2008 crash, and surfaced as the 'heavy weight champion' of mediums which people watch television (not to mention much more profitable than traditional TV/Movie networks - NFLX charges a premium to use their service AND profits from promotion / adds put on their platform, andddd not to mention they're literally sourcing their own material at this point, cutting back on production costs that typical TV stations would incur.) Example of dying sector 3 - [PEI](https://gyazo.com/40f9293dd4006979f8648e83de9306d3). PEI is a real-estate investment trust which specializes in the leasing/development/etc of shopping malls... Again, has been stuck in a long time downtrend (Like most Real-estate investing trusts that aren't specializing in residential renting.) since shopping malls have been becoming practically obsolete in the recent years, especially with the rise of Amazon &amp; other similar companies.

This week: Suspecting a slow bleed monday/tuesday, or at least until the OPEC deal is struck.. Gold &amp; crypto will see early movement as the DXY continues to drop; and upon release of the opec news it will ignite a frenzy of buying across the oil sectors. Effectively pulling the indexes up enough off of their supports enough to promote buying amidst various other sectors (which have beautiful intra-day technicals right now), essentially creating a chain reaction throughout the markets as plenty of whales have been sitting on the sidelines, starring at discounted tickers, wondering if this is the dip.

LT: My projections would lead me to believe this will be a market recovery never seen before; not one of a traditional recession, not one of a depression, and not entirely a 'V' shape.. following this next round 'relief' the bears will be eager to secure some kinda of gains, and those sectors which are truthfully dying will be seeing some of the most dramatic jumps in pricing which will end up pulling index pricing into strange directions... not anything crazy dramatic, but talking the NASDAQ-100 up 1% while the SPY &amp; DJI continue to lag behind  by -.5% loses; essentially laying the groundwork for the potential of a 'reverse tech bubble.' Perhaps in the weeks to come we see another slew of frenzy sell offs in various sectors based around insane indexes, creating one last major dip before another bullish recovery as the prospering sectors help ignite buying from 'LT investors / Firms' in the dying sectors, overall pulling the indexes up in another dramatic fashion.  Perhaps it is time to say, welcome to the future.",finance

personalfinance,Would greatly appreciate advice on where to begin after failing to file taxes long term,"Throwaway because I really need advice for an epic fuck up that I want address it asap. And I'm super anxious about it. 

I'm a US citizen. I have not filed Federal or State taxes for many years, probably since 2004, for reasons I won't get detailed about (a couple of hospitalizations for mental reasons, for which I didn't have insurance, and a bankruptcy, and then having to climb out of a deep emotional/financial hole and find employment after a big outage/resume gap). I have been mostly consistently employed since about 2007 though, and have had taxes and social security withheld every year. So I haven’t filed but I’ve paid federal taxes and SS through payroll deductions.

I need to start cleaning up this mess and would sure appreciate input on how to proceed. 

I have W2s for every year. However I had two periods of unemployment (about 1 year in 2004 and about 3 months in 2018) for which I have no documentation. I also cashed out an 401K in 2018 for which I might owe taxes. I’m 64 so there was no age penalty. I expect to work until around 70 if that’s relevant. I’m employed now. And since I work in IT I’ve made a decent income during this time span. (Retirement is another subject; let’s not go there now.)

That’s just for federal taxes. I’ve lived in many states so I likely owe some state taxes too. 

And while I have all W2s (aside from unemployment periods) I don’t have documentation for banks, 1099s and such. I’ve really only had checking accounts and some 401K though, not high interest accounts.

Anyway, I’m obviously terrible with financial shit and pretty overwrought about this, so I don’t expect to get this  resolved alone. I will need to hire some kind of tax professional; I don’t know if they should be a CPA, EA, tax attorney, other? Would the IRS itself be helpful?

Italy and basically the entire eurozone the United States doesn’t even crack the top 30. The eurozone will have absolutely no choice but to recap their banks right now. The Hong Kong dollar peg will be broken given the turmoil they’ve gone through and the fact that they’re at 900% gpd in relation to their banks. (Iceland 900% of gdp when it went to shit) The fed will be powerless to stop this. Swap lines are only trades at some point those dollars will need to be paid back. It’s a LOAN. The US dollar right now sits at resistance which it’s about to blow through 103.82 is the fib extension but the euro is going sub .80 to the dollar.

Next week it’ll be very interesting so see what the uptake is because if this persists problems will start in a matter of hours. The fed has a 100 trillion dollar problem and they’ve only used 4 trillion. If the move in the euro persists I’d get ready to short even moar.
Easiest way to think about this is the argument everyone makes about the comex which is if everyone asks for gold there isn’t enough gold to go around so you have $15,000 gold price which I agree with.
Right now I’m existence is about 4 trillion in US dollars 1.5 in actual paper money and 2.5 in reserves parked at the fed. 100 trillion in debt (biz says 50 trillion) call it 75 trillion.

I filed federally on Turbotax (with all the 1099s), but wasn't sure how I should go about doing the state returns, so I saved that for later.  I saw that South Dakota doesn't have an income tax so filing is not required(?), and a couple states had reciprocity with my state, but I wasn't sure if I still needed to file individually with each state.  I went through all of the steps on Turbotax and it said no taxes were owed for any of the states, but still wanted me to pay $50 to file with them.  All but Iowa participates in the combined federal state filing program.

So I guess my question is, do I still have to file with all of these states individually?  Do any of the reciprocity rules/fact that I added the 1099s to my federal return/don't owe any taxes with them prevent me from needing to file?  Do I need to do something specific on turbotax to specify for the combined federal state filing program?

in depth discussion: [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/audio/2019-10-18/how-private-sector-balance-sheets-changed-recessions-podcast](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/audio/2019-10-18/how-private-sector-balance-sheets-changed-recessions-podcast)

The U.S. business cycles that ended in the last three recessions involved progressively greater and more troubling risk-taking behavior. Each ended with worse financial fallout and a longer period of recession and weak recovery. Much has been written about the bubbles leading up to the commercial real estate deflation in the late 1980s and early 1990s, the crash of the tech stocks and the ensuing bear market of 2000-2002, and the deflation of home real estate and the debacle in mortgage-backed derivatives in 2006 through 2011. Yet analyses of the bubbles’ causes invariably omit a critical point.

*The evolution of the economy’s aggregate financial structure has, over decades, altered the playing field for financial decision makers throughout the economy, increasingly skewing their available options toward higher risks, lower returns, or both.*

This paper presents two facts that help explain economic and financial performance in recent decades and offers insights into the current business cycle, the 2020s, and beyond.

1. Private sector balance sheets grew faster than income over many decades; thus, aggregate debt grew faster than aggregate income, and aggregate assets grew faster than aggregate income.
2. This disproportionate balance sheet expansion changed financial parameters in the economy, mathematically making financial activity increasingly hazardous and compelling riskier behavior.

The first of these statements is an empirical observation, easily documented. The second is the result of direct logical deduction. Together, they have several consequences:

* From the mid-1980s on—*the era of the Big Balance Sheet Economy*—financial decision makers have had to choose between progressively lower returns and higher risk.
* Too much private sector debt relative to income has adverse consequences, of course, but so does an excessive total value of private sector assets relative to income. An extreme value of aggregate assets relative to income means meager yields and operating returns on assets, distorted financial decisions, and an economy vulnerable to asset price deflation.
* Each successive business cycle in the Big Balance Sheet Economy era has started with proportionately larger balance sheets and has involved more reckless balance sheet expansion leading to even bigger balance sheets and a worse financial crisis.
* Each successive crisis, with more bloated balance sheets to stabilize, was more difficult to resolve and therefore required the government to engineer dramatic new lows in interest rates, heavy fiscal stimulus, and other measures to stabilize economic conditions. The measures eventually overcame recession and chronic weakness, but in doing so they necessarily caused further expansion of balance sheets relative to income.
* During the 2000s, either the housing bubble or some other set of highly speculative, excessively risky, and destabilizing activities was virtually inevitable.
* Increasingly unsound risk taking has been occurring again in the 2010s.
* The present cycle is almost certain to end badly. Although there are signs that balance sheet ratios are undergoing an extended, secular topping process, they remain extreme and will produce serious financial instability during the next recession.
* There is no nice, neat solution to the Big Balance Sheet Economy dilemma, no blueprint for a politically acceptable resolution. The task of preserving prosperity while shrinking assets-to-income and debt-to-income ratios is, if not outright paradoxical, at least plagued by conflicting forces.
* Government policy cannot prevent serious consequences when the Big Balance Sheet Economy corrects, but it can moderate them and help households, businesses, and the financial system cope with them. However, these tasks would be difficult, politically tricky, and prone to cause some backtracking on balance sheet correction even if policymakers fully understood the economic problem.
* Although the outlook is fraught with uncertainties, individuals and organizations can benefit by taking steps to prepare for, endure, and in some cases capitalize on some of the developments ahead.

The U.S. economy continues to face a bubble-or-nothing outlook. Participants in the economy and markets will keep increasing their financial risk until the expansion breaks down, and the bigger the balance sheets are relative to income, the more severe the breakdown is likely to be.",finance

\- Money comes with strings attached - like you cannot layoff employees, etc.

\- Loan repayment terms could change at the discretion of the program admin.

\- Most firms receiving money already have other loans to pay.  New loans were not part of the ""business plans"".

\- The future consumption of goods and services would go down resulting in less than normal income for businesses.

All they are asking is that you put in some time cleaning or running the take out window for about 8 hours a week. They also originally told me that if I went for unemployment that I would not be eligible for rehire, which should be more money then what they are offering. They did not say this to everyone and I attempted to get them to put this in writing but they would only talk to me over phone and did not mention it to me again when I spoke to them later. Now with the new Federal Cares Act offering an extra $600 a week to all people on unemployment, they have not said anything. I now have it in writing that if any employee goes for unemployment, rehire would be by a person by person basis. This is not the first time my employer has done shady/unethical things. I had a new job lined up but has since been taken back due to this outbreak and I need to make sure I will have employment once this is all over.

I feel my employer should be doing the partial unemployment claim for all employees so we can pay our bills and also begin receiving the federal bump. Thank you in advance for all advice.

personalfinance,where to invest life insurance proceeds for elderly mother,"Hi - My father passed away in February. He left my mother a small estate of mainly variable annuities and several life insurance policies. Most everything is under a local investment company.  He was invested in Franklin Templeton, John Hancock, and Pacific Life. No, I don't know why this company or why they invested with these companies. My father was 91 and that generation didn't talk about money with their family, especially children. Some of dads annuities will have to be cashed in and others will be transferred to mom.

My mother is 89, while she's mentally alert she doesn't know, have the comprehension, or desire to deal with finances at this point. We have power of attorneys and she will agree to do whatever we suggest. We're in the process of hiring an elder law lawyer for estate planning and medicaid application so that she doesn't have to spend all of her approximately $300K money to the nursing home. She's currently private pay (\~$130/day) for her bed. She has enough in her savings account for about 6 months for the room, after that we'll have to start an income stream from one of her annuities.

So the question is several life insurance policies will be cashed in worth about $120K total. I screwed in reverse and started the redemption process outside of the investment company. :) Of course, the investment firm wants us to reinvest the money with them in a bond  fund of some sort. I'm inclined to open an account in her name with Vanguard (lower fees ...). I'm tempted just to put the money in a money market type of fund since she shouldn't be exposed to any market fluctuation at this point in her life. But would a fed. gov't. bond fund also be appropriate? What kind of fund would be appropriate for a 89 yr. old with a life expectancy in the 5-10 year range more than likely?

personalfinance,Switching to Bi-Weekly with a Twist,"I switched my mortgage to automatic payments every 2 weeks (bi-weekly), so I will be making 1 extra payment a year. However, my lending company does not apply the payment until the full monthly payment has been met. So, does this negate the financial benefit of paying every 2 weeks because the interest is still accruing until the full balance is paid? My research tells me yes and the only benefit to bi-weekly is budgeting a partial payment every two weeks and it helps make 13 yearly mortgage payments instead of the usual 12.

I already pay extra principal each month, so would it be better for me to go back to paying the full monthly balance at the beginning of the month and adding my extra principal later in the month. I'll be sure to budget to add the full extra monthly payment and add that in by the end of the year as another extra payment on the principal.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's the alternative twist: We have the ability to pay double the mortgage every month - which we plan to do whether or not we are on bi-weekly or monthly. What if we set up our bi-weekly to be the minimum payment and so then every two weeks we are technically paying the minimum mortgage. Will this save us on interest rates since we are ""restarting"" the interest accruing every two weeks? Thanks for any advice!

&amp;#x200B;

Note: We are paying double on mortgage because our goal is to get rid of the mortgage within 5 years (technically 13 years left of the 15 year mortgage) so that we can both work part time when we have kids for the obvious reasons.",finance

investing,How long will the Covid-19 affect the markets? How should everyday investors react?,"Let’s see how the current environment looks like.

&amp;#x200B;

Here are **some uncertainties** that govern investors’ reactions over the past 50 days:

* Nobody knows how long will the pandemic last. Obviously, the longer the worse and there is no indication of slowing down.
* Nobody knows if people who get sick will have immunity over the next potential virus wave.
* Nobody knows how the transition period back to normal economic activity will be achieved and how long it will take.
* Nobody can estimate the real economic damage to the backbone of the economy → SMEs
* Nobody can estimate the second derivative of the sell-off effects, i.e. what will happen with the fallen angels and lack of liquidity.

&amp;#x200B;

**A few facts about the virus:**

* Death rate varies between 0.5% – 7%, depending on population age, ICU coverage and extent of population testing.
* Most of the patients do not present symptoms for many days, which makes the virus extremely effective in spreading.
* No vaccine is expected before the next 12–16 months.

&amp;#x200B;

**Now, a few economic facts and hard data:**

* Almost 50% of US corporate debt is BBB rated now and with most of the world’s population being under lock-down, it is no rocket science that big part of them will fall below investment grade.
* Almost 3.3M Americans filed for jobless claims last week. This is 5x the previous record of 1982.
* The Fed’s balance sheet just exceeded $5 trillion for the first time.
* Markets are deep into bear market territories.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Covid-19 effect:**

Now, it is important to clarify that Coronavirus will not disappear overnight. It will be a long and gradual process lasting 3–6 months. I am afraid the worse is yet to come for markets across the world. The detrimental effects in the real economy are becoming more obvious day by day and translated into spikes in unemployment, mortgage payment delays, lack of liquidity and financing for SMEs, cuts in Capex and supplies, and lastly corporate and personal defaults. This is a self-feeding loop probably leading to what economists describe as secular stagnation.

The Central Banks were not ready to face such a crisis. Rates were extremely low already and their balance sheets were already loaded with a lot of public and corporate debt. Another stimulus plan may be the only solution now, but it is not sustainable in the long run.

My opinion is that markets will remain into bearish territory for many months after the “end of Covid-19”.

&amp;#x200B;

**What can ordinary investors do to prepare?**

1. **You cannot time the market**. You never could and definitely cannot start now. So, instead of guessing whether stock markets are going to rise or fall further after Covid-19, adopt a longer horizon. Get some exposure in the stock market but do it for the long run. There is no point to pick the best mutual fund, as most of them underperform the markets. Go for a cheap ETF. Robinhood or Vanguard will probably do for most jurisdictions.
2. **Normal diversifiers** like corporate bonds are always necessary for an all-weather portfolio. However, keep in mind that in every liquidity crunch most of the risky assets move together and move downwards.
3. **Safe havens**, like government bonds (US, Germany, UK) still have their place in your portfolio.
4. **Look for market-neutral alternatives**. This can be alternative types of exposure, investment styles, methods, etc. Look for market-neutral assets and funds. At the toughest periods, the market-neutral investments will keep your portfolio beating. It is true that market-neutral exposure is not the easiest thing to achieve as an ordinary investor, but there are a few apps that try to achieve that. I find Daedalus Investment Platform interesting, but I am sure there will be others as well for jurisdictions not covered.
5. **Keep some cash**. Not only as a safe haven but to also exploit opportunities when you identify them.

&amp;#x200B;

**Summary**: These are hard times for the markets and events that are unprecedented for our generation. It is and will be tough, but the best we can do is be prepared both for the virus (social distancing &amp; healthy routine) and for our long-run financial plan.",finance

personalfinance,Better to pay off consolidated student loan or max out Roth IRA?,"I have a consolidated student loan debt of roughly $34,000 at a 6.25% interest rate. The payments come out to about $350 monthly, principle and interest almost equal. I have no other debt and a six month emergency cash nest egg. I’m wondering if it’ll be smarter for me to contribute to a Roth IRA or just try to pay as much of the loan’s principal balance every month.

personalfinance,Am I an idiot for wanting to cash out my FERS contributions?,"I'm 30, recently separated from the federal government, and have several options to consider regarding what to do with my FERS contributions. At 4.4% of my salary during these past 5.5 years, my FERS contributions are in the $15k-$20k range. Here are the rough numbers.

&gt;Annuity:  1 percent of your high-3 average salary for each year of service (FYI, I do not plan to return to federal service).  At \~100k and 5.5 years, the annuity would be $5.5k/year.  
&gt;  
&gt;TSP/Roth: Transferring/investing $20k to my TSP/Roth would have a 30-year return of \~$300k, optimistically assuming average gains of 10%/year; or \~$150k at 7%/year.  
&gt;  
&gt;Cash Out: $20k in hand

I know the answer seems obvious: screw the annuity and invest it in TSP/Roth; however, I am headed to a top MBA program and will likely make significantly more money from graduation to retirement. The dilemma is that I am weighing the intangibles of how much my quality of life will improve by having an extra $20k available during school versus having an extra $150k-$300k at retirement. I will not be working during these 2 years at school and currently have about $30k spread across various checking/savings accounts. I should also mention that I will not have to worry about paying tuition/fees so it will just be cost of living (I expect rent will be about $1500/month) and fun stuff (eating out, bars, travel). I am leaning towards cashing out, but I wanted to see if someone would be able to convince me that I'm being an idiot or has any advice on what to do.",finance

If I were to take out a federal loan my employer wouldn’t cover it since I can’t show that I’m paying the college in cash or directly through my checking account. With a LOC I can withdraw and deposit into my checking account to have the college withdraw it directly from there thus providing me with the proper receipts I need to file with my employer. The LOCs I’ve been looking at are through some local credit unions and their rates vary between 10-15% which I believe is worth making 1-2 monthly payments on before paying it off completely as opposed to taking out larger loans through FAFSA at a 4% rate and having to pay it off over a few years.

Comparing world events from 1930-1945 and how we are in a similar situation now. 2020 and beyond.,"As you know for the last couple of years I have been observing a number of big important developments that concerned me that hadn’t happened before in my lifetime but did occur in the 1930-45 period and a number of times before then. They are the confluence of 1) big wealth, values, and political gaps, 2) zero or near-zero interest rates in the three major reserve currencies making monetary policy ineffective, 3) large debts, and 4) emerging conflicts between a rising world power (China) that is challenging an existing power (the US). Because of these concerns, over the last 18 months I have been studying the impact of these forces and the rises and declines of past leading empires and their reserve currencies. These studies led me to believe that when the next downturn came along there was a significant risk that we would see similar events to those that happened in 1930-45 (and many times before that for similar reasons), which would lead to a big shift in the world order. Then the coronavirus and its impacts on the economy and markets came along, so we are now in a downturn and facing these circumstances.

The St. Louis Fed has an amazing database, called FRED, that allows you to easily pull all kinds of economic data and graph it. Here is a little diddy that shows the impact of a low/zero interest rate policy over the last 2 decades. It shows GDP, Fed Debt, and Fed Funds. I had to change the scale of Fed debt to make it match that of GDP, so the text of the scale looks odd.

Notice how starting around 2001 the cheap money policies started as an effort to offset the dotcom bubble bust. Then they unfortunately have continued ever since, albeit more extreme. Notice how Fed debt started increasing materially following the dotcom bust and skyrocketed following the housing bust and hasn't looked back.

At the beginning of 2001, GDP was around $11 trillion and Fed debt around $6 trillion (rounding up). Today GDP is around $22 trillion and Fed debt is around $23 trillion. So for $17 trillion in debt growth, just at the federal level, we've gotten $11 trillion in GDP growth over the last 20 some odd years. Make of it what you will.",finance

Currently I am the only income for 2019/2020. I am also concerned on how MFS will affect the recent stimulus check.

&amp;#x200B;

Without trying to write a book on why my spouse owes $250k+ to Uncle Sam (her psychologist ex-husband sold his practice in Texas while she was a housewife, didn't pay his taxes right, and then his CPA/lawyer screwed up her innocent spouse and it got denied--assuredly did not have her best interests at heart). The married and lived Texas which is a community law state so debt and benefits are split. This guy died a couple years ago leaving her widowed, during which we have established residency in Alabama. So we did not have to bother with a divorce before marriage in Alabama. 

She was separated for about 3 years when I met her. She said the only reason she has not got a divorce at the time is she was worried she would lose benefits of the land against what she owes. He has land in Texas that the IRS and other creditors have a lean against, but we are working on saving to legal counsel for a tax and elder law. We have not been contacted about a will or given any information of the current state of the land. His family cared so little there was no funeral or even obituary. Body was claimed and cremated by the state. The IRS at minimum keeps contact via mail so the debt does not fall off after 7 years of no contact. Ideally if they took the land and left her alone she would be fine with that. Just leave everything of that past life behind that was with an alcoholic domestic abuser.

So she has since always has had her withholding taken each year that she worked for the past 10 years or so. I married for love, even though it seems like I keep finding out about new debts or I am just blocking it out of my mind. I have complete financial control right now until she gets back working. I am able to keep zero balance on my cards month to month along with paying mortgage/rent/utilities. She does not want me to file MFJ because she is worried the IRS will take away my refund for her debt. She would rather divorce me than ""infect"" me with her IRS debt.

Playing around with TurboTax this year if I filed jointly I would get $2,500 more, roughly, back on my return. I thought it would be awesome to apply that to a lawyer or worst case it is money the government can claim to go towards her tab they feel she ""justly"" owes.

My concern is even if I file form 8379 for injured spouse the only way I can make the claim is if (at least on TurboTax):

A) I filed (or will file) a joint return with my spouse (or former spouse)

B) All or part of our federal refund was (or will be) applied to my spouse's past-due federal tax bill.

C) I am not required to pay the past due amount.

The A&amp;C clauses I am fine with. B though scares me because it feels like I am giving them the authority to take everything if they so choose and not just the extra from filing jointly with her.

Our first year of marriage I filed MFS and got my return back super fast via eFile just as when I filed single. I spoke with two separate people from TurboTax through their web chat system. The first who appeared to be a lawyer suggested MFS after I described the situation to him, and the second who was a CPA suggested MFJ. The CPA made this suggestion because since I am in Alabama, which is not listed as a community property state, the IRS would not seize my refund as long as each year I fill out form 8379 when filing MFJ. Briefly Googling around I noticed another TurboTax rep said [similar](https://ttlc.intuit.com/community/taxes/discussion/it-was-important-to-answer-yes-to-question-6-and-you-answ/01/718069#M288674).

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Any thoughts? I am leaning towards MFS until we can consult an attorney to help us. I want to help her, even if the $2500 is a nickel to what she owes, but I just feel like a mouse smelling cheese and not noticing the trap if I check box that had clause ""B"" as mentioned earlier. We have always kept our finances fairly separate.

She said she does not plan to file since she does not have any income, but maybe she can still so that any benefit would go back to what the IRS says she owes? The stimulus info I have entices me to also file MFJ. On my W2 my wages/tips/compensation was listed as $72,912 in box 16 and I always claim our kids. So I may be able to get max stimulus if I still file as MFS.

I don't know. We want to make the best decision for the little family we are making together. On top of all this we are expecting our 3rd and last baby during the peak of COVID-19 this April.

Any helpful advice would be appreciated.

Thanks,

investing,Futures reverse to turn positive as investors brace for another volatile week,"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/29/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html 

U. S. stock futures turned around early Monday morning and edged higher in volatile trading after last week’s sharp gains, even as the number of coronavirus cases in the U.S. continues to rise at an alarming rate.

Earlier, futures had pointed to an implied opening drop of more than 300 points for the Dow.


At around 1:00 a.m. ET, Dow Jones Industrial Average futures were up 132 points, pointing to an implied rise of about 59 points at the Monday open. S&amp;P 500 futures and Nasdaq 100 futures also pointed to a slightly higher opening for Monday. The moves came as crude prices fell sharply. 

The Dow last week posted its biggest weekly gain since 1938, surging more than 12%. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq are coming off their best week since 2009, after rising 10.3% and 9.1%, respectively. To be sure, it was a volatile ride for investors. The S&amp;P 500 posted daily swings of at least 2.9% in four of the five sessions. That includes a 3.4% drop on Friday for the S&amp;P 500.

CH 20200326 Stock market wild swings 10am.png
The sharp gains last week were sparked in part by the prospect of massive fiscal and monetary stimulus. President Donald Trump signed into law Friday a $2 trillion stimulus package that includes direct payments to curb the economic blow from the outbreak. The Federal Reserve also launched a series of measures to sustain the economy, including an open-ended asset-purchase program.

“Bulls staged an epic comeback,” said Ken Berman, strategist at Gorilla Trades. “Despite the rally … the uncertainty regarding the length of the necessary, but economically damaging global lockdowns continues to weigh on risk assets.”

“The technical picture continues to be bearish across the board, despite the mid-week surge in stocks, with all of the key trend indicators still pointing lower,” said Berman, noting the major averages are still below their respective moving-day averages even after last week’s strong gains. 

Coronavirus cases around the world are still climbing, adding to the uncertainty over when lockdown and quarantine measures will be removed and the economy can return to normal.

Data compiled by Johns Hopkins University shows more than 713,000 coronavirus cases have been confirmed globally. The U.S. overtook Italy and China last week as the country with the most cases with over 136,000. Nearly half of all U.S. cases come from New York, where more than 59,000 people have been infected.

“Equity markets are overextended, but face a bumpy period of even grimmer virus news and poor economic statistics in the next 1-2 months,” strategists at MRB Partners wrote in a note. “The world is now entering a third phase, the first being the shock of an out-of-control virus spreading around the globe, then the massive policy response, and now the economic fallout phase has arrived and will test investors’ very fragile confidence.”

Investors got a glimpse of the virus’ economic impact last week. On Thursday, the Labor Department reported a record 3.28 million workers filed for unemployment benefits the week of March 20. That number easily topped the previous record of 695,000 set in 1982. U.S. consumer sentiment also fell to its lowest level in more than three years.

To be sure, the market has also flashed some signals of a potential bottom. The confidence spread between the so-called smart money — large institutions — and dumb money, retail investors, sits squarely in positive territory after dropping to extremely low levels. Meanwhile, insider buying reached an 11-year high.

President Donald Trump also extended at a news conference Sunday the national social distancing guidelines to April 30 and said the death rate would peak in two weeks.

I have a coworker, who also received a 1099, that made a little more than me, and she owes about $700. She did have a few itemized deductions such as student loans, but I'm pretty sure she opted for standard deduction, unless deductions such as student loans and tuition fees can be deducted with standard.

#[Today's Top Headlines for Monday, March 30th, 2020](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/30/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-march-30-2020.html)

*****

&gt; * U.S. stock futures were pointing to a modest decline for the Dow Jones Industrial Average at Monday’s open after President Donald Trump extended national social distancing guidelines to April 30. The Dow, which closed 4% lower Friday, did soar 12.8% for the week, logging its best weekly gain since 1938 and raising questions about whether blue chips have bottomed. However, heading into Monday’s session, the Dow was still nearly 27% off last month’s record highs. The yield on the 10-year Treasury remained below 1% early Monday. U.S. oil prices sank below $20 per barrel, near 18-year lows hit earlier this month.

*****

&gt; * On Sunday, mortgage bankers warned that Federal Reserve mortgage purchases are unbalancing the home lending market. In addition to the Fed’s extraordinary no limit fixed-income purchases, Wall Street analysts and economists said it would not be out of the question to see the central bank take for the first time ever a passive interest in the performance of the stock market.

*****

&gt; * Preparing the nation for a death toll that could exceed 100,000 from the coronavirus, Trump on Sunday walked back his previous remarks about wanting to reopen the country for business by Easter. In continuing social distancing until the end of next month, the president said, “Nothing would be worse than declaring victory before the victory has been won.” Earlier on Sunday, White House health advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci said the country could see up to 200,000 deaths and millions of infections. However, he also cautioned that those numbers are based on outbreak modeling and nothing is certain.

*****

&gt; * The U.S., which has the most known coronavirus infections in the world, saw confirmed cases jump to over 143,000 with 2,513 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University data. New York has about 40% of those cases and fatalities. A field hospital has been set up inside New York’s Central Park to treat coronavirus patients. Abbott Laboratories, which received FDA emergency use authorization on Friday for a test that can detect coronavirus in 5 minutes, was praised by Trump. “Abbott has stated that they will begin delivering 50,000 tests each day, starting this week,” he said. Abbott shares were soaring about 8% in the premarket.

*****

&gt; * Global coronavirus cases increased to over 730,000 with 34,685 deaths and more than 149,000 recoveries. Italy, No. 2 to the U.S. in cases with about 97,700, has the worst death toll. Italy’s 10,779 fatalities are more than three times as many as China’s 3,308 deaths. Rounding out the top three, Spain just surpassed China in infections, with over 85,000 cases and more than double China’s death toll at 6,803. China, where the pandemic started in December, has the world’s fourth most known infections, nearing 82,200 cases. Germany is No. 5 in worldwide cases at about 62,400. It has 541 deaths.

*****

&gt; * Amazon warehouse workers in Staten Island, one of the five boroughs of New York City, plan to strike on Monday to call attention to what they claim is the lack of protections for employees. Chris Smalls, a management assistant and a lead organizer of the strike, told CNBC that workers at the fulfillment center known as JFK8, have grown increasingly concerned about coming into work after an employee tested positive for the coronavirus there last week. Amazon told CNBC that the company was supporting the individual in quarantine and asked anyone who was in contact with the worker to stay home with pay for two weeks. JFK8 remains open.

worldpolitics,The Latest: Putin: Prepare for virus to quickly spread,"The Latest on the [coronavirus](https://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak) pandemic. The new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms for most people. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness or death.

TOP OF THE HOUR:

— Spain [surpasses China](https://apnews.com/6b21476a513dde204be405d2c1a0ce1f) in coronavirus infections tally.

— Prince Charles ends isolation period after positive test.

MOSCOW — Russian President Vladimir Putin says the country has managed to slow down the spread of coronavirus but should be prepared for contagions to quickly grow.

Russia has been relatively lightly hit by the outbreak, with 1,836 cases and nine deaths. But the number of new cases has mushroomed, forcing the authorities to brace up for the worst.

Putin hailed a lockdown declared Monday in Moscow and warned that other regions should prepare to take similar steps.

Speaking to his envoys in Russian provinces in a video call, a stern-looking Putin says they will bear personal responsibility for the availability of hospital beds, lung ventilators and other essential equipment. He says the authorities need to call professors of medical universities and students to help deal with the outbreak.

The Russian leader also talked about the need to counter “provocations, stupid gossip and malicious lies” about the outbreak.

\_\_\_

WASHINGTON — The federal government is asking hospitals to report daily data on bed capacity, supplies and test results for COVID-19.

The hope is to better track the spread of the coronavirus outbreak across the country.

The White House coronavirus task force is already getting data from public health and private labs, but now hospitals are starting to do their own testing in-house. Officials want those results to build a real-time picture of what’s happening around the country. The government is building a technology-driven system to guide decisions about when to re-open parts of the country.

The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services is asking the nation’s 4,700 hospitals to report the data to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

\_\_\_

LONDON — Prince Charles has ended his period of isolation after testing positive for the coronavirus.

The prince’s Clarence House office says Charles is in good health after completing the seven-day quarantine recommended by U.K. health authorities for people with COVID-19 symptoms.

Royal officials said last week the 71-year-old heir to the British throne was showing mild symptoms of COVID-19 and self-isolating at the royal family’s Balmoral estate in Scotland. His wife, Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall, tested negative but will be in self-isolation until the end of the week.

Charles’ mother Queen Elizabeth II, 93, is at her Windsor Castle home west of London with her 98-year-old husband, Prince Philip.

\_\_\_

BERLIN — Chancellor Angela Merkel’s spokesman says it would be “irresponsible” to offer false hope of a quick end to restrictions on public life in Germany, amid increasing calls for an exit strategy.

Germany is a week into a ban on gatherings of more than two people in public. It also has closed schools and most nonessential shops. Merkel’s chief of staff has made clear the measures won’t be loosened before April 20.

There has been little direct questioning of that, but increasing calls to map a way out of the restrictions. Merkel’s government wants to keep the focus on ensuring that Germany’s health system isn’t overstretched.

Merkel spokesman Steffen Seibert says the chancellor “would be the first who would announce the loosening of the measures on the basis of facts, and with pleasure.”

Germany has the world’s fifth-largest number of coronavirus cases but a relatively low death rate so far. Seibert says the increase in infections remains too fast to loosen restrictions.

\_\_\_

TOKYO — Japan’s health ministry says a former passenger of a cruise ship, a woman in her 60s from Hong Kong, died of the COVID-19 pneumonia after being treated at a hospital.

She is the 11th victim from the Diamond Princess, on which 712 of the 3,711 people were infected during a two-week quarantine in the port of Yokohama, near Tokyo.

In all, Japan has about 2,600 confirmed cases and 65 deaths.

\_\_\_

WASHINGTON — Dr. Anthony Fauci says smaller U.S. cities that don’t yet have large numbers of COVID-19 cases are ripe for the acceleration that occurred in New York City.

The U.S. government’s top infectious disease expert told ABC’s “Good Morning America” the “dynamics of the outbreak” of the coronavirus in New Orleans and Detroit show signs that “they’re going to take off.”

He’s also concerned about smaller cities across the country.

“There are a number of smaller cities that are sort of percolating along, couple hundred cases, the slope doesn’t look like it’s going up,” Fauci said. “What we’ve learned from painful experience with this outbreak is that it goes along almost on a straight line, then a little acceleration, acceleration, then it goes way up.”

Fauci says that “very consistent pattern” is the same as what’s occurred in New York, Italy, France, Germany and Spain.

“We’re going to have all of these little mini outbreaks throughout various cities in our country,” he said.

Asked about how long the Trump administration’s recommended social distancing guidelines might be in effect, Fauci says, “I think April might do it...but we kept an open mind when we presented it to the president.”

ATHENS, Greece — Greek government spokesman Stelios Petsas says Greeks they will have to forgo their Easter traditions this year.

Orthodox Easter, which this year falls on April 19, is by far the largest religious holiday in Greece. Families and friends gather, often in summer homes or their native villages in the countryside and on islands, for church services and an Easter Sunday lunch of roasted lamb.

But the government has imposed strict restrictions on movement, banning anyone from traveling to islands unless they are permanent residents and imposing a lockdown on the country in an effort to prevent the spread of Covid-19.

TOKYO — The Tokyo Olympics will open next year in July, the same slot scheduled for this year’s games.

Tokyo organizers say the opening ceremony will take place July 23, 2021. That is almost exactly one year after the games were due to start this year. The IOC and Japanese organizers last week postponed the Olympics because of the coronavirus pandemic.

The rescheduled Olympics will start July 23, with the closing ceremony on Aug. 8. The Paralympics were rescheduled to Aug. 24-Sept. 5.

MADRID — Authorities in Spain say 12,298 health workers in the country have so far tested positive for the coronavirus.

The figure is 14.4% of the total reported infections, which rose on Monday above 85,000. It placed Spain ahead of China and only behind the United States and Italy in the list of nations with greater contagion.

Medical staff has been a cluster for contagion in Spain, where at least nine of Spain’s 17 regions are close or beyond their limit of occupation of intensive care units.

In the hard-hit Madrid region, the military was building additional field hospitals on Monday.

\_\_\_

LISBON, Portugal — Foreigners in Portugal awaiting an official decision on whether they can reside in the country are getting access to public services, such as health care and social security benefits.

The Portuguese government is shutting down the offices of its immigration service on Monday because of the coronavirus. That leaves foreigners waiting for a decision on their legal status in an administrative limbo.

The government says anyone who applied in writing for a residence permit before a state of emergency was declared on March 18 is allowed to work.

The immigration service offices hope to re-open on July 1.

Portugal, which has a population of just over 10 million, has recorded 6,408 cases of the COVID-19 disease and 140 deaths.

\_\_\_

TOKYO — An executive member of Japan’s main medical association urged government officials to consider issuing a state of emergency, saying it will be too late once the coronavirus infection reaches an explosive state.

Satoshi Kamayachi, an executive director of Japan Medical Association and a member of the government-commissioned panel of experts, says the situation warrants a declaration of a state of emergency.

He says most experts at a meeting earlier in the day suggested a state of emergency be issued.

Japan until now was seen as keeping the outbreak under control, but the number of new cases in Tokyo and other cities have spiked since last week. Nationwide, Japan has about 2,600 cases, including 712 from a cruise ship, with 64 deaths. About 1,000 have recovered.

Tokyo Gov. Yuriko Koike last Wednesday warned its residents that the city is on the verge infection explosion. She asked its 14 million residents to stay at home over the weekend and suggested a possibility of a hard lockdown in the capital city.

Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told reporters Monday that Japan is on the edge, but has not reached a stage that requires a state of emergency.

\_\_\_

ATHENS, Greece — Greece’s prime minister is calling on all his cabinet ministers and the lawmakers of his center-right New Democracy party to donate 50% of their salaries over the next two months.

In a Facebook post Monday, Kyriakos Mitsotakis says the country’s politicians “must stand in the front line of solidarity.” He said the money generated from the “symbolic gesture” would be deposited in a special account set up to tackle COVID-19.

“We are all equal in the face of the health threat. But in the fight against it, each one of us must contribute according to their means,” Mitsotakis wrote in his post. “I am sure that the other (political) parties will also follow this choice.”

\_\_\_

BRUSSELS — The European Council says EU member states have suspended airport slot requirements until Oct. 24.

The move aims to ease the impact of the coronavirus crisis on aviation and help airlines adjust to the falling demand caused by the epidemics.

Under EU regulations, airlines are required to operate 80 percent of their allocated slots for take off or landing at a congested airport at a certain time of the day. If they don’t abide by this rule, they face losing their right to the slot.

“It seems clear now that this crisis will not be over very soon. Waiving the ‘use it or lose it’ rule until October will help mitigate the heavy economic impact on airlines and give them certainty over the whole summer season,” said Oleg Butković, the Croatian minister for the Sea, Transport and Infrastructure.

European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said this month abandoning the rule temporarily will not only help the aviation industry, but also have a positive impact on the environment by not flying mostly empty planes to keep their slots.

\_\_\_

MADRID — Spain’s main spokesman in the coronavirus crisis has tested positive for the COVID-19 disease but the results need to be confirmed, authorities announced as the country of 47 million became the third to surpass China in number of infections.

Dr. Fernando Simón, who had become the Spanish government’s face and voice during the crisis, was replaced at Monday’s daily press conference by his deputy, Dr. María José Sierra.

Simón was initially praised for relaying calm and clarity in the early days of the crisis. But as infections and deaths for the virus mounted, he was heavily criticized for having played down the severity of the outbreak.

Sierra says the increase of daily cases had dropped from an average of 20% before March 25, to 12% in the past five days. She says the drop was due to social distancing and confinement measures in place for the past two weeks.

The official says the main worry for the government now was the pressure on the country’s intensive care units because it could arrive 2 or 3 weeks after the infection.

Sierra says,“Reducing the pressure on the ICUs will be important for considering de-escalation measures.”

\_\_\_

LONDON — One of the scientists advising the British government on the coronavirus pandemic says there are signs that the effective lockdown of much of the country is working.

Professor Neil Ferguson thinks the epidemic is “just about slowing” as a result of the social distancing measures the government has imposed over the past couple of weeks.

That’s evidenced by the number of new hospital admissions, he told BBC radio.

“It’s not yet plateaued so the numbers can be increasing every day but the rate of that increase has slowed,” he said.

Ferguson, who had to self-isolate himself a couple of weeks ago after showing signs of the COVID-19 illness, says the number of deaths will continue to rise on a daily basis as it is a lagging indicator. Latest figures show that 1,228 people in the U.K. who have tested positive for the virus have died.

The epidemiologist thinks that between 3% to 5% of people in London may have been infected, with between 2% and 3% in the country as a whole.

\_\_\_

BANGKOK — The Southeast Asian nation of Laos, which detected its first COVID-19 cases last week, has instituted a nationwide lockdown.

The state news agency KPL reports that Prime Minister Thongloun Sisoulith issued an order effective Monday through April 19 prohibiting all citizens and foreigners from leaving their accommodations except for essential activity such as buying food or medical care. Those engaged in agricultural production are allowed out according to rules from their local authorities.

All international checkpoints are closed except for transport of goods and to allow foreigners to return to their countries.

Laos has nine confirmed cases of the coronavirus with no deaths reported. The country of about 7.4 million people is one of the poorest in Asia.

Myanmar, which also reported its first COVID-19 cases last week, is closing its airports to all commercial passenger flights at midnight Monday through April 13. Exceptions are allowed with official permission for relief flights, all cargo flights and medical evacuations.

Myanmar, with a population of more than 56 million, is also one of the region’s poorer countries. It has 10 confirmed COVID-19 cases with no deaths.

\_\_\_

LONDON — British Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, is the latest senior government figure to show symptoms of the coronavirus.

Johnson’s office says Cummings developed symptoms over the weekend and is self-isolating at home.

Johnson announced Friday he has tested positive for COVID-19 and has mild symptoms. Health Secretary Matt Hancock has also tested positive, while the chief medical officer of England, Chris Whitty, says he is self-isolating after showing symptoms.

Senior U.K. officials have been criticized for holding face-to-face meetings until recently, even while urging the rest of the country to stay home and avoid all but essential contact with others.

Cummings is a controversial figure — a self-styled political disruptor who helped lead Britain’s pro-Brexit referendum campaign in 2016. He has been blamed for briefing journalists that the U.K. was seeking “herd immunity” against the coronavirus by letting most of the population get it.

The government and its scientific advisers deny that ever was their strategy

1. Getting a cosigner added to my loan to help me quality for a lower rate and also doing a loan modification.
2. Catching up on back due taxes and business expenses via the new SBA loan $10,000 advance, which I am hoping to qualify for.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you all for your advice and kind words. I wish you all the best in these hard times.

&amp;#x200B;

I have lost my income as a contract recruiter. I currently have $3600.00 in monthly expenses. My mortgage is $1400.00 and is being serviced through Freedom Mortgage. I am currently on IL unemployment which nets around $800 a month after taxes. I was elated to hear Freedom mortgage offering forbearance to it's customers. Traditionally, the forbearance I am used to with private/federal student loans and a couple of my business loans has been to add the typical 3 month forbearance onto the end of the loan. I was horrified to see on Freedom Mortgage's website that :

"" **Forbearance is a temporary suspension of your mortgage payments, allowing you to remain in your home while working through your short-term financial challenges. We will suspend your payments for up to 3 months. At the conclusion of the forbearance period, all of your deferred payments will be due.** ""

If I am initially seeking forbearance because I cannot AFFORD to pay $1400.00 , what makes them think anyone seeking forbearance is going to be able to pay $4200 when the forbearance period ends?

The center confirmed these details, and they are sticking to their statement on their main page. Thank you Freedom mortgage for not giving a damn about your customers impacted during this terrible crisis.

I am desperately seeking help and guidance as to my options. My unemployment every 2 weeks provides me with food/utilities and basic essentials.

I have few other payments that are recurring,  because my family is still able to cover car and health insurance. In total looking at past credit transactions I usually end up spending around 600$ -800$ per month. Currently to my name I have:
2,500$ in a student savings that has a 3% interest rate as long as I keep it under 3,000$
1,300 in a checking account.

What should my next steps be for planning ahead for the future beyond just cutting costs of things I don't need.

investing,Why Tanker Stocks are happy about Oil Prices.,"Hello r/investing! I saw someone earlier today ask on how to capitalize on the current oil price and it finally pushed me over the edge to make a post on some findings I have had the past two weeks.

A BIT ABOUT MYSELF:
--
I’ll start by warning you I am not all that experienced in this field. I made it a New Years Resolution to learn and invest more heavily this year, and I began to aggressively dollar cost average in. I felt pretty good until a few weeks ago when suddenly it felt like everything was red and would be for a long time. I felt like I had just stepped up to the poker table, and a shootout broke out in the saloon. While the losses didn’t look good, I saw this as a tremendous opportunity to pick up some chips off the floor in the chaos. Below is my argument for a great deal of those chips on the floor, but I don’t know how longer they will say.


THE PLAY:
-----
Let’s talk about shipping. The past few years the industry has seen bearish waters and much of the sector has consolidated. Environmental regulations have further taken ships off the market. The industry saw a bump in the end of 2019, and this year has been sold off massively the past few weeks. With COVID, dry goods and general shipping is getting slammed. So funds and anything related to shipping was sold off significantly. However, the subset of oil tanker stocks are primed for an absolutely insane year. The market environment and COVID is set to give crude tanker companies the opportunity to profit at a rate unlike they have seen in decades.

THE BULL EVIDENCE:
--------------
**Contango:** The current price of oil is so low, investors know they can buy it at the price it is now, and sell it for a significant profit later. You have to buy it now though, and where are you going to keep it? Oil land storage is set to fill up within weeks, and the most cost efficient method of storing oil is offshore on a tanker (VLCC). However, since the number of VLCCs available has shrank (scrapping, bought by Saudi’s, or even held up due to quarantine delays) it has driven up the rates of these tankers. Where they once were signing contracts for 20k a day they are now regularly in the 100k+ range (even going so high as to 300k a day).

**Tanker/Oil Demand**: Since VLCCs are being taken off the market (both by Saudi’s using them to ship their cheap oil, and storage rates) this is looking to spillover into smaller tankers as well. Afromax and Supramax tankers are getting taken off the books and driving prices upward across the board. With more oil being pumped but demand continuing to go down these tankers are looking to be parked for months. With supplies slowly getting chipped at once demand starts back up again.

**Positive Earnings despite insane selloff:** Every earnings call that I was able to dig up the past two weeks has had an incredible air of positivity to it, which is refreshing given most of the market sentiment. In fact, every call I listened to said they planned on adding to their dividend and initiating stock buyback programs. TNP went so far as to say “And when I said mindboggling, it’s for the whole bunker industry. It’s not, I mean, in our case. It’s because we know -- I mean -- the Company right now -- we are valued almost as much as cash that we're in the bank, which is -- it is very, very cheap. I think it’s a very good investment for us to make.” Find me another industry right now that is talking like this or is as positive forward looking because I see a whole lot of earnings and guidance getting put on hold. The CEO for INSW said ""This is a once-in-a-generation type of event,"" Zabrocky says, noting charterers are starting to book vessels with storage options for periods of more than a year.
 
**Insider Buys**: Insider activity is a lovely indicator as to the general sentiment within an industry. Selling tells you a little, but I think buying tells you a lot. I think when you have buying across the sector, from multiple players it tells you veeery good things. Buying of this sort causes analyists to throw around words that get me hard like “parabolic”




WHY AM I TELLING YOU THIS:
--------------
Well frankly, I have maxed out my position on this play already. Anything else and I am digging into margin (personal no-no), and I have already thus far seen significant gains while still believing there are more to be made. It is my opinion there are at least a dollar worth of earnings the next year being sold for a quarter. Most of these guys cargo rates are spiking 10x compared to last year.


 I have also found nothing but bullish articles and arguments for my position and I am hoping to perhaps find a bearish one among you out there who have more experience than a guy bored at his computer all day. Since I have been in quarantine, I have felt slightly insane researching a sector I once hardly knew about that none of my friends have any interest in. I am hoping to engage in some interesting discussion with you folk here. Call me an idiot, just tell me why. Here to learn and find better way to do things.

This retard (many so called officials are this kind of retarded) due to his own deliberate ignorance still has open borders for invaders of which should have been closed years ago but this tyrant advocates illegal activity while he chooses to be a globalist thrall and a tyrant who turns his back on Canadians, turns his back on democracy while deliberately still placing Canadian's lives in danger for a bunch of greedy thugs with the intellectual equivalence of a skid mark in someone's underwear who seek to destroy our economy while they divide and conquer with a slew of sick and filthy lies and deceptions forced through legislation as the globalist crime organization and lobbyists work towards stealing our resources while taking over Canada and enslaving surviving Canadians for none other than what I find quite obvious which is cheap labor. Were in the middle of attempted annexing of Canada and instead of having trust worthy officials on our side we have slime creating legislation to assist them getting away with illegal activity while throwing billions of dollars Canada doesn't even have to their friends thus already working towards enslaving current and future generations of Canadians. If they succeed do any of you think you will ever hear of this climate change scam ever again?!! Oh no because if once they control the resources then it's way more than likely to become illegal to ever mention this climate change scam ever again.

&amp;#x200B;

 It's sad because I know how to take back Canada and several other countries all at once while breaking even, but the general public is too selfish greedy and ignorant to be ready for that information and prof of this is we have religious scum for example advocating freedom of religion thus are all for enslaving Canadian's through endorsing islamic take over with their freedom of religion garbage once muslim populations rise as part of the general population of survivors for example. You are not ready, we need to be united and giving that information now would only allow the globalist crime organization to work towards preventing it from happening. It looks like all is doomed but I gave you every chance to wake up, put your selfishness, greed, ignorance and lies fabricated as truth and belief aside but the general population is every bit as bad as the globalist for helping the globalists with their own selfishness, greed ad ignorance. The religious are the scum bags who don't care if you die because their following of factually exposed foundations of lies fabricated as truth and belief is far too important to those who choose to live with their own heads stuffed up their own back sides. Teach kids lies and they wind up growing up to fight for the right to lie and proof of this again are that the world still suffers the mental redundancy known as being religious. Look a your religious neighbor and know they value lies more than they value you being alive as well free and are eagerly assisting to get you and your children killed and enslaved over their sick and filthy following of lies.

Demetri Kofinas speaks with George Selgin, director of the Center for Monetary and Financial Alternatives at the Cato Institute about the recently announced monetary and fiscal policy measures being undertaken to stem the economic fallout from COVID-19 and the government mandated shutdown of the American economy. This is a deep-dive into the specifics of the Federal Reserve and US government’s policies, including the mechanics of the monetary and fiscal stimulus.

We are living in unprecedented times. The closest analogy to what we are experiencing is the mobilization undertaken to fight World War II with one crucial difference: this is a radical demobilization of the American economy. To fight the virus, Americans are being asked to stay in their homes and move about as little as possible. In order to survive a prolonged period of commercial inactivity governments have moved swiftly to pass monetary and fiscal stimulus measures that are themselves as unprecedented as the current lock-down of the global economy. How far will these measures go and what will Western countries like the United States look like on the other side of this crisis? Answering this question may prove more important than any other we have posed before on this program, and we try to answer it today.",finance

   I received an IP PIN CP01A notice from the IRS for last year's tax filing purposes, which I had to use while filing my Federal taxes in 2018. I moved across states last Nov and I specifically remember getting my address changed with the USPS since I got a lot of forward emails from my old address to the new one. 

The issue is: I didn't receive the CP01A notice for 2019 tax filing year through mail and I am unable to use the online tool on the IRS website to retrieve my lost IP PIN number as it is unable to verify that my mobile phone number is registered in my name (which is weird). For users who are unable to register online, IRS provides an option to register through a code that will be sent by mail to the address on file. But are the offices open to send these letters? Or would the mailing of such letters get delayed too due to the recent shutdown (covid reason)? I have been trying to call them on their helpline for IP PIN but it goes to an automated response which says ""services are temporarily suspended"" :( 

Anyone have an idea whether I will still be able to receive letters from the IRS during this period? Also, if I file through mail without my IP PIN, does it get rejected? Or will there just be delays but will eventually get processed without any issues if someone files his federal tax return without the assigned IP PIN number?",finance
investing,Aren't we in a deflationary period?,"The more the Fed keeps printing money, the less impact it actually has. After the 2 major rate cuts, markets dove. This leads me to the question, is this economic environment inflationary or deflationary? My first instinct along with many other I believe is to deem the current environment as inflationary. I was on that train before corona but once the virus hit, I'm convinced we are heading for deflation. I don't expect this to last a while but it will definitely do damage to business.

My evidence for my claim is how low demand for things are. Services are extremely cheap. A Jet Blue flight to Vegas is $18. Things like hotels and flights are so cheap I'm convinced that the companies are losing lots just by continuing operations. The effect of this is that the dollar has strengthened. Big banks and companies like Apple are sitting on huge piles of cash. These companies choosing to not spend is troubling. The U.S. consumer is also nowhere to be found; furthermore, people only want food, toilet paper and hand sanitizer. This increase in the dollar has created the inverse affect in gold. We saw gold diving but has rebounded strongly since. The correlation between the dollar and gold however has been lost a bit. In the initial dive in stocks, everything was selling off and people rushed to find liquidity in whatever markets the could find. I wouldn't be surprised if the dollar jumps even more triggering a sell of in gold. For the Fed, they will need to anticipate this jump in the dollar and suppress the currency. Then gold will get its chance to shine. 

This is all a theory and I encourage whoever is reading this to either offer more evidence supporting my claim or to disapprove it.",finance

From my point of view, it's the CDOs of 2008, except, instead of mortgages, it's corporate debt. Where does this come back to bite us? How exposed are the banks? How big is the market? Apparently, early 2019 estimations put the CLO exposure at $1.4T worldwide. However, recent independent examinations put the market at $1.8T in the U.S. alone. From what I understand, corporations that are too risky or too crappy to get a regular investment-grade loan, or even perhaps a junk loan, are still given loans (called leverage loans), with extremely high-interest rates. However, no lender, not even with high-interest payments, wants to hold on to this stuff. So they package a bunch of them together into SPVs called CLOs, and sell them off. Now, who owns them is also a bit of confusion to me but if anyone on here can answer the following questions that would be great.

Forgive me if there's already a thread on this (or similar), but I searched and couldn't find one. 

I have \~$30k in student loans and \~$5k in high interest credit card debt. Because of consolidation efforts on my part, most of my CC debt is sitting at a promo rate of 0% across two cards. Once the promo period ends, the interest is \~16-17% One of those cards has \~$2,700 and the promo rate ends at the end of April. 

My student loan interest rate is usually \~4%. I've only been paying the minimum on my loans while I pay down my credit cards, so have not really been making much progress in terms of paying them off (I'm basically paying $106 a month and accruing $105 a month in interest). I know that's bad. Credit cards have been my priority. 

I've been paying $700 a month on my credit cards while I have these promo rates and have made incredible progress on my credit card debt (it started close to $15k)

Here's my question - knowing that I have 0% interest on my loans for the next 6 months because of the recently passed COVID law, does it make sense for me to take advantage of this and pay the minimum (or just over the minimum) on my cards and pay the $700 a month on my loans?

investing,Moody's cuts outlook on $6.6 trillion US corporate debt pile to 'negative',"Moody’s Investors Service has cut its outlook on corporate debt to negative, saying that an economy about to tip into recession because of the coronavirus will result in rising default rates.

The ratings agency warned that sectors “most sensitive to consumer demand and sentiment” will be especially hard-hit due to social distancing measures that slashed economic activity. They include global passenger airlines, the lodging and cruise industries, and autos.

In addition, plummeting energy prices will leave the oil and gas sector exposed, while banks also will face a challenging environment amid falling interest rates that eat into profitability and a deteriorating economy that will undermine credit quality.

“The coronavirus will cause an unprecedented shock to the global economy,” Edmond DeForest, senior credit officer at Moody’s, said in a report. “We have revised our growth forecasts downward for 2020 as the rising economic costs of the coronavirus shock and the policy responses to combat the downturn are becoming clearer. Business activity will likely fall sharply across advanced economies in the first half of 2020.”



The warnings comes even after the Federal Reserve took the unusual step of saying it would be buying corporate debt as a way to keep liquidity flowing in a market that froze up after the government announced social distancing measures.

While Moody’s said central bank intervention will help, some of the most heavily indebted sectors still will be vulnerable. The Fed’s purchases will be limited to investment-grade companies with strong credit quality.

“Government support will cushion the blow for some companies, but it is unlikely to prevent distress at businesses with less certain long-term viability,” DeForest wrote. 

Nonfinancial corporate debt totaled $6.6 trillion at the end of 2019, a 78% increase since the Great Recession ended in mid-2009. 

Low interest rates and easy financing terms helped fuel the boom. Investor protections known as covenants have been around all-time lows, meaning that some buyers could see big losses in event of defaults.

There also are companies on the borderline of investment grade and in danger of sliding to junk status that are posing risks for the corporate bond market. Goldman Sachs estimates that $765 billion worth of investment- and high-yield bonds have experienced ratings downgrades already in 2020.

DeForest also noted significant refinance risks — some $169 billion of debt will come due in 2020 and $300 billion in 2021 and rolling over that debt will be difficult “under these trying conditions,” DeForest said.

personalfinance,Sanity check: I've been thinking of refinancing for months. Can someone tell me if I'm being stupid?,"TL;DR: I'm 2 years into a 15-year mortgage on a 4-unit property I live alone in. I've long been considering refinancing to a 30-year to reduce my monthly payments, and think now might as well be a good time to pull the trigger. I've only ever had this one mortgage, and I've never refinanced before. PersonalFinance has taught me a lot, so I was hoping someone could tell me if I'm being dumb.

I bought my house in Dec 2017, purchase price $385,000, and I put 20% down on a 15 year mortgage at an interest rate of 3.625%. My payments are $2480/month. I owe $271,000 as of today. For whatever it's worth, Zillow values the house at $405,000. I'll probably die in this house, but I probably still have 20-40 years to go.

The house is split into 4 units. If I rented them out, the units would pull in $800 each ($1200 with some remodeling). My original vision when I bought the house was to live in one of the units and rent out the rest, but after moving in I saw that the whole property could use some serious updating. I really enjoying living in it alone right now while I take my time remodeling it. I can't afford to remodel it all at once, and at my current rate I expect it to take another 12-18 months. I'm okay with this.

(I've never remodeled before, either, so I'm learning as I go. I'm old and slow, but trying to do as much on my own as I can, so gimme a break.) ;-)

Today, my net income is about $10K/month, so I can easily take on the mortgage without renters and pay for the remodel over time out of pocket. I'm going to face a loss of about 50-60% of my income in the next 3-5 years, so I'm trying to plan for that \*now\*. I'll be ""okay"" if I do nothing. But I'd like to be ""okay-er"".

So I've been thinking about refinancing the house with a 30-year mortgage. I know I'll pay more in the long run, but I like the idea of having additional breathing room for my monthly mortgage payment. The freed-up cash each month would speed up the remodel, and when I do finally rent out the extra units, the difference will make for a larger month-to-month income stream. (Right?)

I'm also considering taking out cash on the refi in order to help pay for the remodeling all at once, and possibly to invest some in another business. This option sounds the most attractive. While the interest rates will be higher with a cash out refi, they're still lower than taking out a separate loan for that cash.

Is there something I'm missing or not considering? Am I dumb for going through with this?",finance
personalfinance,What debt to tackle first?,"Hello friends, 

My first post on reddit. Curious what debt I should tackle first in my mission to bring my monthly expenses down. 

Credit cards all get paid off monthly. 

I have 2 outstanding student loans and an auto payment. 

First student loan has a balance of $14,500 and a rate of 6% (this may be variable as well)-payment is $136.88 per month but I pay $250 currently. 

Second student loan has a balance of $16,200 and 4.66% average interest rate (it’s variable)-payment is $130 per month but I pay $230 currently. 

Auto loan is $33,000 at 3.5% and it’s worth probably $55,000 - I have paid some chunks down on this but the payment is $789 per month. 

Other than that I have a mortgage that is $1800 a month. Taxes and insurance that are probably another $1200 a month. 

Income is around 200k per year.

investing,Fed Set to Dial Back Pace of QE Treasury Buying Next Thursday (It's been at,[deleted],finance
investing,The Federal Reserve will slow the pace at which it buys Treasuries under its unlimited quantitative easing program. (It has been at 75 billion dollars PER DAY.),"**My questions are at the end of this post.  Thank you.**

On Bloomberg from 3 days ago:

\----------------------------------------------------------------------

The Federal Reserve will slow the pace at which it buys Treasuries under its unlimited quantitative easing program.

The U.S. central bank, which has been aggressively purchasing Treasuries for the past two weeks in a bid to offset the economic and market fallout from the coronavirus pandemic, on Friday said that it would dial back the daily pace of buying to $60 billion next Thursday and Friday. It will continue purchasing at the existing pace of $75 billion a day for the first three days of next week.

“This is a more nimble Fed, at least opposed to the earlier QE Fed, because they’re not operating off a rule book -- they’re trying to calibrate the amount needed and retaining flexibility,” said Priya Misra, global head of rates strategy at TD Securities. “The fact that they’re easing into it is a good sign, they’re trying to get more data, the fact they’re giving us a week notice, that’s good.” If $60 billion a day proves too little, Misra said she wouldn’t be surprised to see them increase the amount again.

The central bank announced its return to quantitative easing earlier this month as virus concerns ripped through global markets and the prospects for the global economy cratered. And this past Monday it declared that it would purchase assets “in the amounts needed to support the smooth functioning of markets.” It has bought Treasuries at a steady clip of $75 billion a day since then, although there was some talk in the market that the monetary authority might look to ease back.

They couldn’t buy $75 billion a day forever, so “stepping it back slowly” to $60 billion “makes sense,” said Thomas Simons, a money market economist at Jefferies LLC. “They’ve been having a few of the purchases under-subscribed so that’s a sign they don’t have to go full bore.”

At this pace the Fed will have bought almost $1 trillion dollars of Treasuries by end of next week.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------

Original Article: [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-27/fed-set-to-dial-back-pace-of-qe-treasury-buying-next-thursday](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-27/fed-set-to-dial-back-pace-of-qe-treasury-buying-next-thursday)

&amp;#x200B;

Note that the article says the Fed has been buying Treasuries at **75 billion dollars PER DAY** and that the **Fed will have bought almost $1 trillion dollars of Treasuries by the end of the week**.

**Question: Is this a sustainable pace?**  What if it is not?  If it is not sustainable, **when will the Fed stop?**  **What will happen to the treasure yield when the Fed stops buying at this crazy pace?**

**Question: Could someone please give some overall insight on how this will work out, especially with the context of what happens if the Fed stops buying treasuries at 60 to 75 billion dollars per day.**

That makes no sense. Things happened since then. The passage of a $2 trillion relief bill. The significant advancements in testing and vaccines. The unlimited QE/liquidity promised by the Fed. No these things aren't without consequences, but you can't just say inflation is going to get out of control when you have no idea what you're talking about.

American household combined wealth was worth well over 120 trillion dollars during the peak. Now have fallen before 100 trillion mark. With such large amount of on money disappearing throughout US and the world, that be be deflation, not inflation?  So might not be so great for bitcoin?

Also, most of the investors are retail, if you watch bitcoin prices, it's usually the strongest near the beginning of the month as the working salary person gets paid. This virus situation really puts a damper in prices. How many of you guys are putting money into crypto? People will be selling off cryptos just to survive.

My girlfriend resell high end handbags, we hope the stimulus package would maybe help her clear some inventory, but I think there will be deflation, not inflation of prices on our handbags.  

I think what would happen, is that after the economy craters completely, and maybe at least 2 years of prices falling then we can see hyperinflation, and final destruction of dollar.

Hi everyone! I'm entering residency next year and am new to the personal finance game. I've perused many online sources regarding personal finance, and I'd like to say that I am familiar with the broad range of topics and vocabulary. One thing I cannot decipher is why most sources (including those tailored for medical residents) say go for the Roth.

I understand that income tax brackets play a role here. Say for example during residency I will be in the 22% federal tax bracket. Throughout my career, I'll likely be around the mid-30%s (let's just say 35%). I have read that people should opt for the Roth if they know they will be in a higher tax bracket throughout their careers.

Following advice, I should open a Roth so that I am only taxed at 22% on my contributions now. That makes sense. Then keep contributing through Backdoor throughout employment. Come withdrawal time, I can withdraw this money tax-free. **When exactly does one withdraw from their account for retirement? Does one (or would I) be withdrawing when I am in the higher income bracket (which justifies having a Roth all the years), or does everyone generally withdraw maybe a year after they've retired so that they are in a lower income bracket (does it work like that?)?**

As a thought scenario, what if I opened a traditional IRA for residency + employment and save all that tax money upfront? Use that saved money to invest somewhere else (overall, more money to allow growth). Then withdraw when I am fully retired and have regressed from an income bracket in the 30' to 20's?

Fortunately, I have a job where I can work from home and continue to have a stable income for the foreseeable future still. Also, so you better understand some of my prior decision making, my parents are stable and decently well off, so if I had a true emergency, I would be financially covered with a ‘zero-interest loan.’

I am a recent college grad with ~$13k of Federal Student Loans. I have always wanted to stop living paycheck to paycheck, and I believe this is best achieved by having an emergency fund for one off’s along with three months or so of living expenses saved. However, I have failed to build these funds because I HATE the fact I’m in debt and consistently pay down as much debt as I possibly can at the expense of financial freedom. 

I have some decent chunks of change coming in here soon consisting of (1) tax refunds and (2) a COVID-19 stimulus check.

personalfinance,ETrade Premium Savings Account - Interest Rate Change,"I opened a Premium Savings Account with ETrade last October.  I have been receiving 1.75% each month since then.  However, I noticed today the amount is now 0.2%.  No typo, 0.2%!  Now, to be honest, I have been avoiding looking at any of my retirement account balances over the past month for obvious reasons, but did I miss something?

Is there a different HYSA that would be a better option?  I am certainly not bound to ETrade but it was the easiest option since my company uses them for management of both NQ Stock Options and RSUs.

Thanks in advance!!",finance
CryptoCurrency,My two cents... or 2 dollars at this rate,"Obligatory cliche intro: Many of you probably remember what r/CryptoCurrency was like before 2017...

Of course there were still plenty of moon/lambo enthusiasts, but by and large the attitude was that cryptocurrency would fix the problems in our banking system. I always thought it would be a good idea to put some money in crypto in case another economic meltdown happened, but I didnt realize it would happen this soon.

Lets look at the facts (I'm American, so this is from an american point of view):

\- Weekly unemployment claims are up \~600% since 2008. [It's a bigger green candle on the chart than shitcoins in December 2017](https://eresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/2020-03-28-US-unemployment-claims.jpg)

\- The US government is going to give away 2 **trillion** dollars. This money will simply be added to the national debt, which if you consider that the debt isn't going to be paid back, basically means it gets printed from nothing. That's about 6000 dollars per person in the united states printed out of thin air. [You've probably already heard of this one, but here's a link](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/house-gives-final-passage-2-trillion-coronavirus-stimulus-bill-n1170281)

\- The President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, when prompted ""To the person who is about to grab their car keys and go to the ATM and take out 3000 dollars, you say what?"" responded: ""There is an infinite amount of cash in the Federal Reserve. We will do whatever we need to do to make sure there’s enough cash in the banking system."" [I kid you not.

personalfinance,"Error found on accepted Tax form from Credit Karma, what do I do now?","I found an error in the accepted tax form I submitted through credit karma, and am not sure what to do or how I should amend this finding. 

Last year I did a maxed out Roth backdoor ($6000) which I reported on my 2019 taxes. I entered all the necessary information using Credit Karma including a Form 8606 and double checked the forms prior to submitting to make sure the amount due indicated on the Credit Karma dashboard matched the actual tax draft form. Was pretty straight forward, I didn't have anything too crazy; just a few stock trades, the backdoor, and using standard deductions. The numbers added up, so I submitted. 

Once the forms were accepted, I went ahead and started to pay the dues online. Just to make sure I was paying the right amount, I opened the ""accepted"" tax form to get the exact dollar amount, and lo and behold, the amount due indicated no longer matched what the Credit Karma dashboard was showing. The accepted forms were populated with about $2000 more for federal dues and $1000 more for state dues. 

I looked through every line to redo the math and pulled up the pre-submitted and accepted forms for side-by-side comparison. Turns out the ""accepted"" 1040 had a line populated that was not populated in the pre-submitted 1040. Line 4b, taxable amount was populated with the $6000 that I converted with my IRA backdoor, hence increasing my taxable income by that amount and my taxes owed by the amount above. I checked the accepted Form 8606 and is populated correctly, line 18, taxable amount is empty as it should be. 

This is a pretty expensive mistake, and I have been trying to reach out to Credit Karma a few times to correct this, but they have not followed up with any of those times. What do I do now? How do I go about correcting this filing? I have not paid any of my owed taxes yet. 

Thanks in advance for help with this!",finance
politics,Black Death Makes Us Think About Interest Rates,[deleted],finance
personalfinance,Would a cash back Mortgage be worth it?,"Currently my fiancé and I make a combined 110k annually. We just got out of most of our debts from college except for my car loan about $800 monthly. We have a relatively strong income, great credit, and the price range that we are wanting to buy is a max of 300k currently (Likely a condo)

We live in Canada B.C. where mortgages require a minimum of 5% down. We would need just 15k for a down payment however with the rent we are paying it would take us a a year to save up enough for a down payment and closing costs

Due to Covid-19 the bank of Canada has cut its rates quite a bit.

In this situation would it make sense to front the down payment with a 0% interest credit line and get it paid back with a cash back mortgage? From my understanding they are 1-1.5% higher than a normal interest rates.

I think it’s likely interest rates will increase by the time we even scraped up enough for a down payment and closing costs so I would break even? 

Is it worth it? Is there a cleaner way?",finance
personalfinance,Trying to refinance my home but don't know a way...,"Hello Redditors,

I normally don't like to ask for help but if anyone reading this could give some advice or like to share anything that might help me see my issue in a different light it would greatly be appreciated. With the interest rates as low as they are, like many I am trying to refinance but just cant seem to do it. Here is my situation:

**Home Value:** $280,000  
**Amount Left on First Mortgage Loan:**  $215,000  
**Current Interest Rate:** 5%  
**Monthly Payment:** $1550

Now the issue, during the loan process I qualified for subordinate financing and used two CalHFA programs to purchase my home. This resulted in 2 second liens (they are silent subordinate loans that are due when I either finish paying my first mortgage or if I ever refinance). So in wanting to refinance my first mortgage, I have to find a way to pay those 2 loans since they will become due and I cant find a way to refinance and take cash out to pay those off. Doing so (refinancing the first mortgage and taking out $17,750 to payoff those two loans) makes my LTV jump to 83% (when ideally its better to be at 80% or lower) so all mortgage companies I have spoken to tell me that they cant help. 

Here is the info on the two silent loans:

**Subordinate Loan 1:** $8,750 with a 2.5% interest rate (My Home Assistance Program)  
**Subordinate Loan 2:** $9,000 with a 0% interest rate (Zero Interest Program)

Anywho, I am at a loss and don't know what to do... I have been talking to many mortgage companies for about 2 weeks now and they are all saying the same... is there something I am not seeing or that you would recommend I do? I am all ears and appreciate any advice, comments, or plans you might have.

*About Me:*   
*I am in my mid 30's, have no other debt except for my home, unfortunately have no savings (these last couple of years I made it my goal to get rid of all debt and I accomplished that this year). Also, having great credit didn't help my situation (I currently have a score of 820)*",finance

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.

The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

cybersecurity,What should you do if you have been hacked?,"Hi mate, here are my tips for staying safe. Apologies for some beginner tips. Please kindly share your tips too. Thank you. I wish you and your family safety from Coronaviruses.

**So you've been hacked?** Stay calm and get some damage limitation in place. If you've got any of the tools below, now's the time to use them. If you don't, look into them (or alternatives) ASAP.

* Tell the relevant people: your bank, the police, and any sites involved
* Change your passwords – including any you think thieves could get to, not just for compromised accounts
* Warn personal contacts that you've been hacked
* Consider wiping data remotely if your device is stolen: go to iCloud for Apple, or Google's Device Manager for Android
* Locate your devices if you can but don't go looking for them yourself! Tell the authorities.

Police - Report loss of money, data deleted and other cybercrime to the Police (keep a copy of the police report for the rest of your life) or google ""XYZ country cybersecurity department. Engage a cybersecurity company but first google online for business review. Wear a laminated sign on your backpack to draw suspicion from the country's anti-terrorist authorities to monitor your computer and internet so you become the bait for cybercriminals for the Federal Police, FBI or CIA to entrap the cybercriminals to catch bigger criminals. Keep a log of every call you make, when you made it and with whom you spoke and what occurred on the call. Report scam call phone numbers to police non emergency hotline 131 444.

personalfinance,"Well this is a weird one - having a negative balance on our student loan, now what?","We requested a payoff amount and made our final student loan payment on 3/26 (great!) but while the payment was processing over the weekend FedLoan updated our account to reflect the switch to 0% interest on 3/13. This dropped our outstanding interest to what it was on 3/13 so when I woke up this morning the payment had gone through and we now have a negative $15 account balance. Is winding up with a balance something that happens from time to time? Should I email FedLoan to give them a heads up?

Honestly I knew the 0% thing was coming down the road but I was so eager to pay this off I did the impatient thing instead of the prudent thing.

investing,Federal Reserve announces temporary FIMA Repo Facility,"[Link to press release](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20200331a.htm)

Content:

&gt;The Federal Reserve on Tuesday announced the establishment of a temporary repurchase agreement facility for foreign and international monetary authorities (FIMA Repo Facility) to help support the smooth functioning of financial markets, including the U.S. Treasury market, and thus maintain the supply of credit to U.S. households and businesses. The FIMA Repo Facility will allow FIMA account holders, which consist of central banks and other international monetary authorities with accounts at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, to enter into repurchase agreements with the Federal Reserve. In these transactions, FIMA account holders temporarily exchange their U.S. Treasury securities held with the Federal Reserve for U.S. dollars, which can then be made available to institutions in their jurisdictions. This facility should help support the smooth functioning of the U.S. Treasury market by providing an alternative temporary source of U.S. dollars other than sales of securities in the open market. It should also serve, along with the U.S. dollar liquidity swap lines the Federal Reserve has established with other central banks, to help ease strains in global U.S. dollar funding markets.  
&gt;  
&gt;The Federal Reserve provides U.S. dollar-denominated banking services to FIMA account holders in support of Federal Reserve objectives and in recognition of the U.S. dollar's predominant role as an international currency. The FIMA Repo Facility, which adds to the range of services the Federal Reserve provides, will be available beginning April 6 and will continue for at least 6 months.

personalfinance,Debt elimination advice,"I’ve been grappling with the order to pay my debt down in, and I’m stuck. We’re at a place where that’s our central focus right now, to get back on track. I’ve already raised my credit score 64 points in the past two months, so I’m really determined to get this right moving forward. Here’s my plan so far:

1. Pay off all credit debt that is in collections or high balances on existing credit cards so I’m using no more than 10% of my limit. I’ve been working toward this for awhile, but in the next couple months, I will be able to settle with the companies and pay a lump sum in full for the two accounts in collections. 

2. Pay off all past neglected bills on my and my husbands credit report and ask the companies to do a pay for delete. (There’s a few, they are mostly small amounts ranging from $60-$200). 

3. Then this is where I’m stuck. Do I funnel all my extra cash into my student loans? (One is federal, and one is private)? They both are current, and I’m making minimum payments monthly. 
OR, do I funnel all my extra cash into the rest of our medical bills which are floating somewhere (not yet on my credit report as delinquent), and I don’t know what the status of them is? 
OR, do I split my extra cash between the two so I’m hitting them both, but not one more aggressively? 

My thoughts are to funnel it all into the student loans, pay them way down, then tackle the rest of our medical debt that’s not in collections. 

Other factors: we also need to save for a second car. I was hoping to do this after step number 2, while working on either the student loans, the medical bills, or a combination of both.

* Stop making payments on all eligible loans for the next 6 months. In my case, all loans held by my servicer have automatically been placed in a 6 month forbearance period with 0% interest. 
* Place all of those payments into my HYSA. This will allow that money to gain some interest over the 6 month period while also giving me extra emergency savings should I need it.
* Just before the 6 month period ends on Sept. 30th, take the money back from my HYSA and apply that towards the capital of my highest interest rate loans. This will make the biggest long term dent on my loans.

personalfinance,[US] Financing through repair company or personal loan?,"Hello,

My friends AC unit needs replaced and unfortunately she can't go much longer without it as we live in Arizona and it's already been in the 80's. 

She's in a situation where she would need to finance the purchase ($8k), however doesn't want to utilizing savings at this time.. however projects she can have it paid off in a year. 

The repair company is offering her a financing plan with a 8.9% interest rate. She has good credit and has no debt. 

Given the current economic situation, would a personal loan offer her better interest rates than 9%? I thought I had heard interest rates went down a lot recently. 

Side question: The repair company did a hard inquiry on her credit. If she decided to shop around for a personal loan, would these personal loan inquiries lump into the same hard inquiry as the repair companies check?

Edit: so it looks like the repair company used a bank to finance the loan; EnerBank USA. So I guess my question is.. is 9% high for a personal loan right now?

I didn't receive any tax documents for this income, but I know the organization is reporting it because it came out of a specific budget.

Looks like this will surely spark outrage around the world thus escalate war and divide over the scum of the Earth and everyone's enemy known as religion but hey this is what globalists want and Trump works towards escalating the problem by showing favoritism for one group of filthy religious liars over another.

&amp;#x200B;

 Hey, all those countries facing islamic take over, Trump advocates it because he advocates that it's in any way shape or form acceptable to do the same thing for some other filthy religious group of religious liars of which that group has been slaughtered and evicted from almost everywhere they went for thousands of years including what is now called Israel on more than one occasion thanks to their following of filthy religious lies I find to be quite obvious. So sad we live on a planet chalked full of ignorant mentally redundant imbeciles and proof of this is that the world still suffers the mental redundancy of those who still stoop to refer to themselves as the religious after thousands of years of such filthy lies already leading to war and divide and to the death of millions if not billions of people to this very day.

&amp;#x200B;

Unlike the religious I happen to value human life more than I value any and every factually proven foundation of filthy religious lies (every religion) which is why it is my pleasure to fight for the destruction of religion for the well being and sanity of current and future generations of the life on this planet. No need to thank me for stepping up to the plate for the last 20 years on this one because I realize I'm likely the only one capable thus have taken this under my wing with the utmost seriousness in every way I deem acceptable.

&amp;#x200B;

Perhaps Omar is right, perhaps they are in it for the money to transform it into resources etc. I haven't seen any evidence that discredits that they are in it for monetary gain (my choice of words as opposed to money) instead I see people who cower from justifying opposing such with any validity while hiding behind so called laws to relieve them of justifying anything with any validity. Here they are placing their sick relgious lies on a pedestal while condemning others for what they claim to believe thus revealing themselves as a bunch of pathetic intellectual cowards and hypocrites with no validity, just force garbage through congress to try and make their sick rubbish unquestionable like any dictatorship would such as in every muslim country. No better than the muslims, bunch of sick and pathetic mentally redundant liars the lot of them. Make laws to try and force people to be ignorant, how weak, sick and pathetic.

&amp;#x200B;

Nothingness is the absence of energy and matter hence there is nothing. Energy and matter are both physical. If someone tells you that there is anything that exists beyond the physical realm, they are lying because the fact remains that without the physical there is nothing. Not anything can go poof into existence out of nothingness let alone develop and intellect out of nothing, let alone be able to create with nothing because the fact always remains that it takes energy, matter and time to re create energy and matter which proves beyond any shadow of doubt that not anything with intelligence could ever be the creator of everything. The very factual evidence proving that no such thing as an allah or god ever existed beyond lies fabricated by the selfish and the greedy who make up such pathetic lies to use to take advantage of those from a time of weakness for power and control over the many. If the religious are going to start imprisoning people for their beliefs then why aren't all religious people in prison where they belong under the guise of such a pathetic excuse for logic?!!

&amp;#x200B;

We would be wise to criminalize propagating factually proven foundations of lies which would shut down region for good, shut down sick and selfish interest groups like the lgbt, shut down the globalists and release the main stream media from being controlled by the intellectual equivalence of a skid mark in someone's underwear, end thousands of years of war and divide over lies and greatly reduce corruption at record speed because again lies lead to war and divide as does favoring a group of sick and pathetic liars over another.

&amp;#x200B;

Oh I am no Omar fan, I see the larger picture of which the religious are too selfish greedy and ignorant to want to acknowledge themselves as the bunch of filthy liars they prove to be. How much more greedy selfish or ignorant can anyone get than to value a factually proven foundation of filthy religious lies more than they value human life hence what it means to be religious?! Ignorance is regions only defense as here we have these sickos creating laws to try and impose citizens to exorcise ignorance towards their disgusting filth. Much like the lgbt which has followed religious example of ignore fact, make up lies, call such rubbish their belief which trying to create laws to make criminals out of citizens for exposing such sick and filthy lies. Meanwhile the religious whine and complain about lgbt's sickly lies and tactics when the religious set the example in the first place which is much like a filthy religious group creating laws to try and silence citizens and those from other religions from exposing their sick and filthy lies as well shady narratives.

personalfinance,Cash out Refi - CC Debt,"Hello All - this is a throwaway account fyi.  I'm very embarrassed of my debt situation, and looking to make a move to alleviate the stress involved with CC Debt.  The debt has been carried for many, many years and I've used 0% transfers for the most part to try and control it. 

My situation:

40 years old - Roughly $80-$85K/per year  with great benefits, 401k (7%), and pension.  Fiancee makes $65k and pays the bills and makes monthly Credit Card payments.

House has $165k, with 25 years left on a 4.25% 30 year. When the house was purchased it was appraised at $223k, in todays market it would easily be $250k (conservative estimate).  Monthly payment is $1800.

CC Debt - Roughly $25k (but this includes myself and fiancee).  

Student Loan - $35k make $600/month payments

No car debt.

I'd like to do a cash out refi possibly, and have contacted quicken loans.  

My dilemma is should I do15/20/30 year refi.  

Plan would be Cash out refi $25k, to pay off CC debt.  This would free up a combined rough $1k/month in cc payments.  I'd really like to go from a 25 year remaining mortgage to a 15 or 20 year mortgage with a lower interest rate.  The problem is the cost of the new refi is about $7k, rolled into the new mortgage.  I'm hesitant because it makes me think I have to pay $7k to access my $25k cash out.  Does this make sense?  Should I just get a Heloc?

Some other caveats, we live in NJ and are seriously looking at moving to Florida.  I have applied to a few positions, but  my current position is pretty great so I'm hesitant to take ""any"" job out there.  The fiancee works in an industry, where she could move tomorrow.  With CoronaVirus, there is a possibility my job will start being more aggressive with remote work.  Does this matter much, when looking at doing a refi?  Are there Refis that have no cost, or is there a barometer to gauge if I'm being charged accurately, such as a percentage of the loan?

Our goal is to get out of CC debt, but it never seems like we can get over the hump.  I know spending is a concern, and we are doing our best to control it.  The only CC transactions at this point are for vacations.  

Any insight or guidance would be greatly appreciated.  I feel like the debt just weighs me down, and even though I have a pretty good job, it's very hard to enjoy the fruits when I have this constant CC debt in my head.",finance

The limit is only $200 and it's a secured card so if I want to increase that limit, Id have to increase my deposit. It also has a dangerously high interest rate of 27.99% so if I ever carry a balance it would be a heavy hit.

If I fill up my gas tank and get lunch and I'm over 30% usage.

I bought a computer part from work with my card and paid it off right away but my usage was recorded during the time kn between and so my score dropped from a 640 to a 570. Now my card is payed off entirely and it's up to 693.

My score goes up overall, but these periodic dips are concerning.

I recieved a letter from PenFed Credit Union offering me a card with a 0% balance transfer for 12 months, and a variable interest rate of 8.25% to 14.75% which even at the highest rate is considerably lower than my current card.

Should I apply for this new card? And what should I do about my Discover card?

I live at home so my only bills are gas, and insurance.

My dad also seems to think that my car is likley to die on me soon and I should think about getting a new one. How much is too much for me to spend?",finance

personalfinance,Car refinancing for a newcomer,"Hi,

On December 2019 I financed a new car with a solid downpayment. Nevertheless, the interest rate that I got from Chase was about 9.8% for the 3 years loan.

Now, several months later, I got my first credit score (\~640). So I'm trying to realize whether there is a chance for refinancing and reducing the interest rate accordingly.

Based on this [post](https://www.thebalance.com/best-banks-for-refinancing-auto-loans-4178024) there is a list of banks that provide refinancing options:

* LightStream
* CarFinance
* CapitalOne
* BOA
* AutoPay
* LendingClub
* Consumers credit union

Do you think it's a good idea or I shouldn't jump the gun since my credit score is still poor? And what is your refinancing story?

personalfinance,Recent College Graduate Personal Finance Help (Long Post),"Hello everyone! I am 23, fresh out of college and I am looking for personal advice in regards to my finances. I come from a low income background and now is the first time I will start earning some real money. I would like to be responsible with my finances right from the start. I have acquired an exciting full time position and will start working later this year. 

I live in California and my income before taxes will be 93k. My employer has a 401k match plan of 2:8 (I put in two percent and they match eight). I currently have 38k in student loans with an interest rate of 5.5%. Moreover, I have no savings. I expect to spend around 1.6k a month in rent plus utilities (Bay Area rent) which becomes around 30 percent of my monthly income after tax. 

I would like some advice on how to manage my money effectively. How much of my monthly income should I invest in my 401k, I have read that 10% is a safe bet but since my employer matches 8% I do not know if that is a wise decision rather than investing in a Roth IRA. I would like to be able to start saving for a home (10 years from now) as well as an eye surgery (2 years from now). I also have very specific goals that I want to accomplish such as helping my mom retire. I am not sure how much per month I should put aside in order to help her with retirement 10 years from now. Moreover, I expected to save 5% of my after tax income for an emergency fund. I will also get 6-7k yearly in bonuses, i am not really sure how I should invest these. 

I know these are very specific and maybe I would need a financial advisor/ planner to help me. Are there any websites/advisors that have helped you manage your budget in the past? I really wanna be efficient about my money and reach these short and long term goals. Thank you so much!",finance

stocks,COVID19: Investing ideas if social isolation lasts for years.,"Hello Fellow Traders and Investors,

I would like you to consider the following the following data points:

1. A coronavirus vaccine would take 12-18 months to develop fast-tracked.  And that's the best case scenario.  Like many other viruses, it could take years and be plagued with many problems.  A vaccine might not save us from our social-isolation economy for a long time.
2. Herd immunity is likely to require [significantly more than 60%](https://www.sciencealert.com/why-herd-immunity-will-not-save-us-from-the-covid-19-pandemic) of the population to be immune to coronavirus.  If this is season and each outbreak has to be kept to 1-2% of the population so as not to overwhelm hospitals, it would take many years before herd immunity rescues us from our stay-at-home economy.

So, who are the losers in  3-5 years of a ""Coronavirus Economy""?  What businesses are unlikely to recover in spite of federal bailouts?

Well, if there is a partial lock-down for years, I think the big loser will be commercial real estate.  All the places that make money collecting rent for large groups of people.  Maybe malls, convention centers, sports arenas.  If the outbreaks are seasonal, then cold weather gatherings.  Ice hockey rinks.  Concert halls.  There must be some sort of commercial REITs that can be shorted, or at least buy some far out put options for.

But more than that, if there is a prolonged retail slump then all the businesses that support the back end of retail will suffer.  Which companies service the websites, apps, and payment collection for small businesses?  I assume credit card companies get better margins from small customers rather than large, so a bunch of people switching to Amazon and Walmart might mean reduced income for Visa and Mastercard.

Anyway, my question is this:  what are you speculative investing opinions assuming a partial shutdown that last years?

Edit:  by ""partial shutdown"" I mean that we would reopen most things with much increased social distancing, like China has done.  But we might not be able to fully open crowded venues.",finance

Forex,Trading economic news,"The majority of this sub is focused on technical analysis. I regularly ridicule such ""tea leaf readers"" and advocate for trading based on fundamentals and economic news instead, so I figured I should take the time to write up something on how exactly you can trade economic news releases.

This post is long as balls so I won't be upset if you get bored and go back to your drooping dick patterns or whatever.


# How economic news is released

First, it helps to know how economic news is compiled and released. Let's take Initial Jobless Claims, the number of initial claims for unemployment benefits around the United States from Sunday through Saturday. *Initial* in this context means the first claim for benefits made by an individual during a particular stretch of unemployment. The Initial Jobless Claims figure appears in the Department of Labor's Unemployment Insurance Weekly Claims Report, which compiles information from all of the per-state departments that report to the DOL during the week. A typical number is between 100k and 250k and it can vary quite significantly week-to-week.

The Unemployment Insurance Weekly Claims Report contains data that lags 5 days behind. For example, the Report issued on Thursday March 26th 2020 contained data about the week ending on Saturday March 21st 2020.

In the days leading up to the Report, financial companies will survey economists and run complicated mathematical models to forecast the upcoming Initial Jobless Claims figure. The results of surveyed experts is called the ""consensus""; specific companies, experts, and websites will also provide their own forecasts. Different companies will release different consensuses. Usually they are pretty close (within 2-3k), but for last week's record-high Initial Jobless Claims the reported consensuses varied by up to 1M! In other words, there was essentially *no* consensus.

The Unemployment Insurance Weekly Claims Report is released each Thursday morning at exactly 8:30 AM ET. (On Thanksgiving the Report is released on Wednesday instead.) Media representatives gather at the Frances Perkins Building in Washington DC and are admitted to the ""lockup"" at 8:00 AM ET. In order to be admitted to the lockup you have to be a credentialed member of a media organization that has signed the DOL lockup agreement. The lockup room is small so there is a limited number of spots.

No phones are allowed. Reporters bring their laptops and connect to a local network; there is a master switch on the wall that prevents/enables Internet connectivity on this network. Once the doors are closed the Unemployment Insurance Weekly Claims Report is distributed, with a heading that announces it is ""embargoed"" (not to be released) prior to 8:30 AM. Reporters type up their analyses of the report, including extracting key figures like Initial Jobless Claims. They load their write-ups into their companies' software, which prepares to send it out as soon as Internet is enabled. At 8:30 AM the DOL representative in the room flips the wall switch and all of the laptops are connected to the Internet, releasing their write-ups to their companies and on to their companies' partners.

Many of those media companies have externally accessible APIs for distributing news. Media aggregators and squawk services (like RanSquawk and TradeTheNews) subscribe to all of these different APIs and then redistribute the key economic figures from the Report to their own subscribers within one second after Internet is enabled in the DOL lockup.

Some squawk services are text-based while others are audio-based. [FinancialJuice.com](https://financialjuice.com) provides a *free* audio squawk service; internally they have a paid subscription to a professional squawk service and they simply read out the latest headlines to their own listeners, subsidized by ads on the site. I've been using it for 4 months now and have been pretty happy. It usually lags behind the official release times by 1-2 seconds and occasionally they verbally flub the numbers or stutter and have to repeat, but you can't beat the price!

*Important* - I’m not affiliated with FinancialJuice and I’m not advocating that you use them over any other squawk.  If you use them and they misspeak a number and you lose all your money don’t blame me. If anybody has any other free alternatives please share them!


# How the news affects forex markets

Institutional forex traders subscribe to these squawk services and use custom software to consume the emerging data programmatically and then automatically initiate trades based on the perceived change to the fundamentals that the figures represent.

It's important to note that every institution will have ""priced in"" their own forecasted figures well in advance of an actual news release. Forecasts and consensuses all come out at different times in the days leading up to a news release, so by the time the news drops everybody is really only looking for an *unexpected* result. You can't really know what any given institution expects the value to be, but unless someone has inside information you can pretty much assume that the market has collectively priced in the experts' consensus. When the news comes out, institutions will trade based on the difference between the actual and their forecast.

Sometimes the news reflects a real change to the fundamentals with an economic effect that will change the demand for a currency, like an interest rate decision. However, in the case of the Initial Jobless Claims figure, which is a backwards-looking metric, trading is really just self-fulfilling speculation that market participants will buy dollars when unemployment is low and sell dollars when unemployment is high. Generally speaking, news that reflects a real economic shift has a bigger effect than news that only matters to speculators.

Massive and extremely fast news-based trades happen within tenths of a second on the ECNs on which institutional traders are participants. Over the next few seconds the resulting price changes trickle down to retail traders. Some economic news, like Non Farm Payroll Employment, has an effect that can last minutes to hours as ""slow money"" follows behind on the trend created by the ""fast money"". Other news, like Initial Jobless Claims, has a short impact that trails off within a couple minutes and is subsequently dwarfed by the usual pseudorandom movements in the market.

The bigger the difference between actual and consensus, the bigger the effect on any given currency pair. Since economic news releases generally relate to a single currency, the biggest and most easily predicted effects are seen on pairs where one currency is directly effected and the other is not affected at all. Personally I trade USD/JPY because the time difference between the US and Japan ensures that no news will be coming out of Japan at the same time that economic news is being released in the US.

Before deciding to trade any particular news release you should measure the historical correlation between the release (specifically, the difference between actual and consensus) and the resulting short-term change in the currency pair. Historical data for various news releases (along with historical consensus data) is readily available. You can pay to get it exported into Excel or whatever, or you can scroll through it for free on websites like [TradingEconomics.com](https://tradingeconomics.com/calendar).

Let's look at two examples: Initial Jobless Claims and Non Farm Payroll Employment (NFP). I collected historical consensuses and actuals for these releases from January 2018 through the present, measured the ""surprise"" difference for each, and then correlated that to short-term changes in USD/JPY at the time of release using 5 second candles.

I omitted any releases that occurred simultaneously as *another* major release. For example, occasionally the monthly Initial Jobless Claims comes out at the exact same time as the monthly Balance of Trade figure, which is a more significant economic indicator and can be expected to dwarf the effect of the Unemployment Insurance Weekly Claims Report.

[USD/JPY correlation with Initial Jobless Claims (2018 - present)](https://imgur.com/zRbLLJo)

[USD/JPY correlation with Non Farm Payrolls (2018 - present)](https://imgur.com/y2sG9ZP)

The horizontal axes on these charts is the duration (in seconds) after the news release over which correlation was calculated. The vertical axis is the Pearson correlation coefficient: +1 means that the change in USD/JPY over that duration was perfectly linearly correlated to the ""surprise"" in the releases; -1 means that the change in USD/JPY was perfectly linearly correlated but in the opposite direction, and 0 means that there is no correlation at all.

For Initial Jobless Claims you can see that for the first 30 seconds USD/JPY is strongly negatively correlated with the difference between consensus and actual jobless claims. That is, fewer-than-forecast jobless claims (fewer newly unemployed people than expected) strengthens the dollar and greater-than-forecast jobless claims (more newly unemployed people than expected) weakens the dollar. Correlation then trails off and changes to a moderate/weak *positive* correlation. I interpret this as algorithms ""buying the dip"" and vice versa, but I don't know for sure. From this chart it appears that you could profit by opening a trade for 15 seconds (duration with strongest correlation) that is *long* USD/JPY when Initial Jobless Claims is lower than the consensus and *short* USD/JPY when Initial Jobless Claims is higher than expected.

The chart for Non Farm Payroll looks very different. Correlation is positive (higher-than-expected payrolls strengthen the dollar and lower-than-expected payrolls weaken the dollar) and peaks at around 45 seconds, then slowly decreases as time goes on. This implies that price changes due to NFP are quite significant relative to background noise and ""stick"" even as normal fluctuations pick back up.

I wanted to show an example of what the USD/JPY S5 chart looks like when an ""uncontested"" (no other major simultaneously news release) Initial Jobless Claims and NFP drops, but unfortunately my broker's charts only go back a week. (I can pull historical data going back years through the API but to make it into a pretty chart would be a bit of work.) If anybody can get a 5-second chart of USD/JPY at March 19, 2020, UTC 12:30 and/or at February 7, 2020, UTC 13:30 let me know and I'll add it here.


# Backtesting

So without too much effort we determined that (1) USD/JPY is strongly negatively correlated with the Initial Jobless Claims figure for the first 15 seconds after the release of the Unemployment Insurance Weekly Claims Report (when no other major news is being released) and also that (2) USD/JPY is strongly positively correlated with the Non Farms Payroll figure for the first 45 seconds after the release of the Employment Situation report.

Before you can assume you can profit off the news you have to backtest and consider three important parameters.

**Entry speed**: How quickly can you realistically enter the trade? The correlation performed above was measured from the exact moment the news was released, but realistically if you've got your finger on the trigger and your ear to the squawk it will take a few seconds to hit ""Buy"" or ""Sell"" and confirm. If 90% of the price move happens in the first second you're SOL. For back-testing purposes I assume a 5 second delay. In practice I use custom software that opens a trade with one click, and I can reliably enter a trade within 2-3 seconds after the news drops, using the FinancialJuice free squawk.

**Minimum surprise**: Should you trade *every* release or can you do better by only trading those with a big enough ""surprise"" factor? Backtesting will tell you whether being more selective is better long-term or not.

**Hold time**: The optimal time to hold the trade is not necessarily the same as the time of maximum correlation. That's a good starting point but it's not necessarily the best number. Backtesting each possible hold time will let you find the best one.

**The spread**: When you're only holding a position open for 30 seconds, the spread will kill you. The correlations performed above used the midpoint price, but in reality you have to buy at the ask and sell at the bid. Brokers aren't stupid and the moment volume on the ECN jumps they will widen the spread for their retail customers. The only way to determine if the news-driven price movements reliably overcome the spread is to backtest.

**Stops**: Personally I don't use stops, neither take-profit nor stop-loss, since I'm automatically closing the trade after a fixed (and very short) amount of time. Additionally, brokers have a minimum stop distance; the profits from scalping the news are so slim that even the nearest stops they allow will generally not get triggered.

I backtested trading these two news releases (since 2018), using a 5 second entry delay, real historical spreads, and no stops, cycling through different ""surprise"" thresholds and hold times to find the combination that returns the highest net profit. It's important to maximize *net* profit, not expected value per trade, so you don't over-optimize and reduce the total number of trades taken to one single profitable trade. If you want to get fancy you can set up a custom metric that combines number of trades, expected value, and drawdown into a single score to be maximized.

For the Initial Jobless Claims figure I found that the best combination is to hold trades open for 25 seconds (that is, open at 5 seconds elapsed and hold until 30 seconds elapsed) and only trade when the difference between consensus and actual is 7k or higher. That leads to 30 trades taken since 2018 and an expected return of... *drumroll please*... **-0.0093 yen per unit per trade**.

Yep, that's a loss of approx. $8.63 per lot.

Disappointing right? That's the spread and that's why you have to backtest. Even though the release of the Unemployment Insurance Weekly Claims Report has a strong correlation with movement in USD/JPY, it's simply not something that a retail trader can profit from.

Let's turn to the NFP. There I found that the best combination is to hold trades open for 75 seconds (that is, open at 5 seconds elapsed and hold until 80 seconds elapsed) and trade every single NFP (no minimum ""surprise"" threshold). That leads to 20 trades taken since 2018 and an expected return of... *drumroll please*... **+0.1306 yen per unit per trade**.

That's a profit of approx. $121.25 per lot. Not bad for 75 seconds of work! That's a +6% ROI at 50x leverage.


# Make it real

If you want to do this for realsies, you need to run these numbers for **all** of the major economic news releases. Markit Manufacturing PMI, Factory Orders MoM, Trade Balance, PPI MoM, Export and Import Prices, Michigan Consumer Sentiment, Retail Sales MoM, Industrial Production MoM, you get the idea. You keep a list of all of the releases you want to trade, when they are released, and the ideal hold time and ""surprise"" threshold. A few minutes before the prescribed release time you open up your broker's software, turn on your squawk, maybe jot a few notes about consensuses and model forecasts, and get your finger on the button. At the moment you hear the release you open the trade in the correct direction, hold it (without looking at the chart!) for the required amount of time, then close it and go on with your day.

Some benefits of trading this way:
* Most major economic releases come out at either 8:30 AM ET or 10:00 AM ET, and then you're done for the day.
* It's easily backtestable. You can look back at the numbers and see *exactly* what to expect your return to be.
* It's fun! Packing your trading into 30 seconds and knowing that institutions are moving billions of dollars around as fast as they can based on the exact same news you just read is thrilling.
* You can wow your friends by saying things like ""The St. Louis Fed had some interesting remarks on consumer spending in the latest Beige Book.""
* No crayons involved.

Some downsides:
* It's tricky to be fast enough without writing custom software. Some broker software is very slow and requires multiple dialog boxes before a position is opened, which won't cut it.
* The profits are very slim, you're not going to impress your instagram followers to join your expensive trade copying service with your 30-second twice-weekly trades.
* Any friends you might wow with your boring-ass economic talking points are themselves the most boring people in the world.

stocks,Why Stocks Can Only Go Up,"I want everyone to know I was the biggest bear in this market since December. I still am in a way cause I know this economy cannot sustain itself through the coronavirus. But stocks will still go up...

With infinite QE, wouldn't hyperinflation be inevitable once the coronavirus is no more? More money means things will cost more due to inflation. Stocks are currently being inflated and will only get more inflated until you eventually walk into a McDonald's and a burger costs you $300. This causes increase in revenue for McDonald's which means $MCD stock keeps going up and will maintain a higher price.

With Donald Trump's love to keep pushing the market to all time highs every week, $SPY will keep going up. If you had unlimited money and you wanted to invest your money, you would buy stocks now that they are low. Stocks keep pumping higher and higher.

personalfinance,Refinancing an unsecured RV loan. Is it possible?,"I’m looking to refinance an unsecured loan on a custom RV. My interest rate is currently 6.3%, and I’ve found several loan providers offering ~4.8% on a longer term RV refinancing loan. I have about 6 years left on the loan and I can afford the current monthly payments. I plan to continue to pay the new loan off at the same rate, but I figured it was a no-brainer to get a lower interest rate with a longer term so I have the flexibility of making lower payments if I hit lean times in the future.

I have two questions:

1) How does refinancing an unsecured vehicle loan work? Since the title is in my name (not the bank’s), is it even possible? Or is it essentially the same process as refinancing a standard vehicle loan? I wasn’t able to find any guidance online.

2) Assuming it’s possible to refinance the loan, am I missing something here? Is there a downside I’m not seeing? I'm thinking I'd probably wait to see if interest rates drop in the coming months before going through with it.

I plan to talk to a credit union about it, but I thought getting a little more knowledge about the process beforehand could only help.

If you’re wondering why I didn’t get the lower interest rate loan to start, it’s because the RV is a custom camper van, and the original financing situation with a dealership and a custom van conversion was too complicated for those lenders to touch. Now that it’s registered as a motorhome, I'm hoping things might be more straightforward.

Thanks for any help you’re able to offer. I have learned so much from this community and appreciate all the collective wisdom here!",finance

personalfinance,"Received a letter from CA tax bureau ""additional documents required - refund pending"" but still received tax refund?","I'm a first time filer and I'm filing for my family together, we're new immigrants so there's a lot of things that my parents are not familiar with so I do a lot of things for them since my English is a bit better. When I filed using the free file software IRS provided, it says we met the requirements to claim Earned Income Tax Credit and so I fill that out and claimed EITC. I understand there's a chance that we would need to submit additional documents...but now we still got our refund, do I still have to mail those documents? Because there are some documents that are a bit tricky to get right now like a letter of record from my school...but as you all know there's the coronavirus, school is suspended until early April, and under the circumstances I don't really want to head out either but if I have to I will. And by the way, our federal tax refund got through successfully without any notice mail to us. Any sort of suggestion is appreciated!",finance
personalfinance,My Father Is Trying To Receive Social Security Benefits On Behalf of My Mother's Income... Will This Affect Her Share?,"As the title suggests, my dad just turned 62 and is aiming to collect social security benefits ASAP. He has a poor financial history and is basically unemployable after some question career moves in the 2000's, but my mom has a stable job as a nurse and is looking forward to retiring in about 10 years. I'm very nervous that him collecting as an ex-spouse will eat into her own social security payments that she has worked hard to earn. Does anyone know how this works? Is it out of one big federal pool of taxes and doesn't affect her share, or is it one ""account"" basically? Reference of benefit is below - thank you for any clarity:

According to [SSA.gov](https://ssa.gov/), if you are divorced, but your marriage lasted 10 years or longer, you can receive benefits on your ex-spouse's record if:

* You are unmarried;
* You are age 62 or older;
* Your ex-spouse is entitled to Social Security retirement or disability benefits; and
* The benefit you are entitled to receive based on your own work is less than the benefit you would receive based on your ex-spouse's work.",finance
personalfinance,New Mortgage guidelines allow 2 months savings for income eligibility?,"[https://www.housingwire.com/articles/fha-va-join-fannie-freddie-in-relaxing-appraisal-and-income-verification-standards/](https://www.housingwire.com/articles/fha-va-join-fannie-freddie-in-relaxing-appraisal-and-income-verification-standards/)  Article linked for context:

  

I have recently read in several news articles that Fannie and Freddy have both changed their income eligibility reqs, along with Mortgages through FHA and the VA. The changes specified are that if income is unable to be verified through traditional means due to the situation with jobs and the COVID outbreak, income verification could be accomplished simply by verifying that the borrower has enough cash to cover 2 months of mortgage payments, including any PMI, Principal, Interest, and Property taxes. I’m curious as to whether it has been implemented yet, or if that is still being worked on, and whether my situation will allow it. I’ll outline what I believe to be relevant below.

I live in Rochester, New York. My FICO score is 723. I am currently on paid leave as a barista from starbucks. My store closed and I will be making about as much as I was before, without working. My rough salary from that is 17K, though it is part time and can vary, so I lowballed slightly from what I am currently making. I have previously been told it is not qualified, as I have been there less than a year, and lenders generally look for 2 years of part-time income to qualify. I am also a student using the Montgomery GI bill and receive a stipend of up to $2200 per month that I am in school, prorated for months that I do not attend for a full month. According to previous experience, it is not considered qualified income because it is dependent on me attending college. I’m expected to graduate with an associate’s this May and will be continuing with a Bachelor’s in the fall. I don’t pay tuition because NY has a tuition award for veterans that covers that, so I’m only responsible for books and fees, much of which is covered by Pell grant funds. I currently and in the hiring process at another part-time job contracting part time for a gross salary of at least 22k. I only have the background check to pass, which may take up to 2 months, though I don’t think it will take quite that long. My current debts are a car loan for which my payment is $351/ month, and about 8k in credit card debt that has a minimum payment just shy of $250/month. I currently have about $1000 in savings and am expecting $3350 in the next few weeks from my state and federal tax returns, along with the $1200 stimulus payment that will eventually be received. Total cash that I would have in savings after I get the refund are about 5k. The houses I’ve been looking at are around 80k, though I would be looking for a max mortgage closer to 85K depending on circumstances. I have not contacted an agent because I don’t want to waste their time if I’m still not even eligible, though I have been monitoring Zillow for options.

Can I realistically get a house based off those new guidelines?

Do those new guidelines apply to me?

Thank you for any assistance.",finance
